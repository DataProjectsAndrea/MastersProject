In the shadow of the ancient cypress tree, a piercing scream shattered the silence, echoing through the mist-laden air.

"She was very much afraid she ’adn’t shut the window on Monday night, though she wished her ’ead ’ad been cut off afore she’d been so forgetful. Here the witness burst into tears and was given some water, while the Coroner refreshed himself with a third lozenge. Recovering, witness stated that she had certainly looked into all the rooms before going to bed. No, it was quite impossible for a body to be ’idden in the flat without her seeing of it. She ’ad been in the kitchen all evening, and there wasn’t ’ardly room to keep the best dinner service there, let alone a body.",0
"""None unless he was a most consummate actor. Whatever happened to change his mind must have happened either at the mysterious appointment which he kept after dinner, or while he was in bed between midnight and 5.30 a.m.” “Well, Bunter,” said Lord Peter, “what do you make of it?” “Not in my department, my lord. Except that it is odd that a gentleman who was too flurried or unwell to fold his clothes as usual should remember to clean his teeth and put his boots out. Those are two things that quite frequently get overlooked, my lord.",0
"I see red if anybody questions my judgment about a book. And Levy who was nobody twenty years ago romps in and carries off Freke’s girl from under his nose. It isn’t the girl Freke would bother about it’s having his aristocratic nose put out of joint by a little Jewish nobody. “There’s another thing. Freke’s got another side-issue. He likes crime. In that criminology book of his he gloats over a hardened murderer. I’ve read it, and I’ve seen the admiration simply glaring out between the lines whenever he writes about a callous and successful criminal. He reserves his contempt for the victims or the penitents or the men who lose their heads and get found out.",0
"It seemed, however, as though the man had melted out of society without leaving a gap or so much as a ripple. Assigning a motive for the murder of a person without relations or antecedents or even clothes is like trying to visualize the fourth dimension admirable exercise for the imagination, but arduous and inconclusive. Even if the day’s interview should disclose black spots in the past or present of Mr.",0
"“Wait a second,” he said. “I’ve thought of something. If Sugg’s there he’ll make trouble. I must short-circuit him.” He ran back, and the other two men employed the few minutes of his absence in capturing a taxi. Inspector Sugg and a subordinate Cerberus were on guard at 59, Queen Caroline Mansions, and showed no disposition to admit unofficial inquirers. Parker, indeed, they could not easily turn away, but Lord Peter found himself confronted with a surly manner and what Lord Beaconsfield described as a masterly inactivity. It was in vain that Lord Peter pleaded that he had been retained by Mrs. Thipps on behalf of her son.",0
"“By the way,” said Lord Peter, “to skip across for a moment to the other case, has it occurred to you that perhaps Levy was going out to see Freke on Monday night?” “He was; he did,” said Parker, rather unexpectedly, and proceeded to recount his interview with the nerve-specialist. “Humph!” said Lord Peter. “I say, Parker, these are funny cases, ain’t they? Every line of inquiry seems to peter out. It’s awfully exciting up to a point, you know, and then nothing comes of it. It’s like rivers getting lost in the sand.” “Yes,” said Parker. “And there’s another one I lost this morning.” “What’s that?” “Oh, I was pumping Levy’s secretary about his business.",0
"Shall I go an’ eat my lunch in the corner?” Lady Swaffham gracefully forgave the culprit. “Your dear mother is here,” she said. “How do, Mother?” said Lord Peter, uneasily. “How are you, dear?” replied the Duchess. “You really oughtn’t to have turned up just yet. Mr. Milligan was just going to tell me what a thrilling speech he’s preparing for the Bazaar, when you came and interrupted us.” Conversation at lunch turned, not unnaturally, on the Battersea inquest, the Duchess giving a vivid impersonation of Mrs. Thipps being interrogated by the Coroner.",0
"“I am ashamed ” “That’s all right,” said Parker, cheerily. “I can wait.” He assisted Freke into the taxi. “What number? 24 Russell Square, driver, and look sharp.” The taxi drove off. Parker remounted the stairs and rang Lord Peter’s bell. “Thanks, old man,” he said. “I’ll stop the night, after all.” “Come in,” said Wimsey. “Did you see that?” asked Parker. “I saw something. What happened exactly?” Parker told his story. “Frankly,” he said, “I’ve been thinking you a bit mad, but now I’m not quite so sure of it.” Peter laughed.",0
"“What d’you suppose has happened to the old man?” “Cursed if I know,” said the Honourable Freddy; “knocked on the head by the bears, I should think.” “P’r’aps he’s gone off on his own,” suggested Lord Peter. “Double life, you know. Giddy old blighters, some of these City men.” “Oh, no,” said the Honourable Freddy, faintly roused; “no, hang it all, Wimsey, I wouldn’t care to say that. He’s a decent old domestic bird, and his daughter’s a charmin’ girl. Besides, he’s straight enough he’d do you down fast enough, but he wouldn’t let you down. Old Anderson is badly cut up about it.” “Who’s Anderson?” “Chap with property out there.",0
"""Dozens, dear such a dreadful place, the City, isn’t it? Everybody Ishmaels together though I don’t suppose Sir Reuben would like to be called that, would he? Doesn’t it mean illegitimate, or not a proper Jew, anyway? I always did get confused with those Old Testament characters.” Lord Peter laughed and yawned. “I think I’ll turn in for an hour or two,” he said. “I must be back in town at eight Parker’s coming to breakfast.” The Duchess looked at the clock, which marked five minutes to three. “I’ll send up your breakfast at half-past six, dear,” she said. “I hope you’ll find everything all right.",0
"Similarly, he thinks Mr. Thipps may have concealed the body in the box-room or elsewhere. Therefore you may be sure he searched the box-room and all the other places for signs of occupation. If they had been there he would have found them, because he was looking for them. Therefore, if he didn’t find them it’s because they weren’t there.” “All right,” said Parker, “stop talking. I believe you.” He went on to detail the medical evidence.",0
"The Coroner then addressed the jury, reminding them with some asperity that they were not there to gossip about who the deceased could or could not have been, but to give their opinion as to the cause of death. He reminded them that they should consider whether, according to the medical evidence, death could have been accidental or self-inflicted, or whether it was deliberate murder, or homicide. If they considered the evidence on this point insufficient, they could return an open verdict. In any case, their verdict could not prejudice any person; if they brought it in “murder,” all the whole evidence would have to be gone through again before the magistrate.",0
