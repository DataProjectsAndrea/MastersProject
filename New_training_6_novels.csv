"""It appears so, mon ami,” said Poirot cautiously. “Appearances are deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.” As we hurried in a taxi to the Magnificent, I puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme. “That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.” “Ma foi!” said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse. “One cannot think of everything!” I felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind. “Cheer up,” I said consolingly. “Better luck next time.” At the Magnificent, we were ushered at once into the manager’s office.",0
"There was only one diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, celui-là! “But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled. “For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.” “Lady Yardly?” “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance.",0
"But I can’t help feeling that it’s rather a forlorn hope. I’m really pinning my faith to Mr. Carter.” “Then I shouldn’t.” “Why?” “Just an idea of mine.” “Oh; but he must do something. There’s no one else. By the way, I forgot to tell you of a queer thing that happened this morning.” And she narrated her encounter with Sir James Peel Edgerton. Julius was interested. “What did the guy mean, do you think?” he asked. “I don’t quite know,” said Tuppence meditatively. “But I think that, in an ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer’s way, he was trying to warn me.” “Why should he?” “I don’t know,” confessed Tuppence.",0
"Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard. You wouldn’t like me to come with you, would you?” “I should love it.” “Nice girl. Sure you won’t change your mind and come and look for lions in Rhodesia?” “Quite sure.” “He must be a very handsome fellow,” said Sir Eustace plaintively.",0
"” The letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold characteristic hand: “Villa Geneviève Merlinville-sur-Mer France “Dear Sir, “I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I will give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have heard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be discreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account of a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life.",0
"But we nailed him in Antwerp thanks to Mr. Poirot here.” As these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer, and was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn, introduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye. “I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,” remarked Poirot. Japp closed one eye knowingly. “No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.” But Poirot answered gravely: “There I differ from you.” “Oh, come!” said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time. “Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man’s caught red-handed.",0
"And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s. And the one on the tray?” “John Cavendish’s. I saw him put it down there.” “Good. One, two, three, four, five but where, then, is the cup of Mr. Inglethorp?” “He does not take coffee.” “Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.” With infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup, sealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did so. His physiognomy underwent a curious change.",0
"His body was dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent identification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately for England. None of the real Hersheimmer’s friends or intimates saw him before he sailed though indeed it would hardly have mattered if they had, the impersonation was so perfect. Since then he had been hand and glove with those sworn to hunt him down. Every secret of theirs has been known to him. Only once did he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew his secret. It was no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever be offered to her.",0
"When I had finished he said unexpectedly: “What do you know of brachycephalic heads?” I mentioned Papa. “The Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind upon your own shoulders, young woman. But it’s all pretty thin, you know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us as it stands.” “I’m perfectly aware of that.” “What d’you want, then?” “I want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.” “Can’t do that. We’ve got our own special man on it.” “And I’ve got my own special knowledge.” “What you’ve just told me, eh?” “Oh, no, Lord Nasby. I’ve still got something up my sleeve.” “Oh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl.",0
"Even I did not suspect triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, mon ami! On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle.",0
"I don’t know what bêche-de-mer is, I never have known, I probably never shall know. I’ve guessed once or twice and guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to talk about a stoep_ I do know what a stoep is it’s the thing round a house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you call it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw.",0
"Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so.",0
"“Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics.",0
"Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall. I looked round me and then caught my breath with a gasp.",0
"Moth balls again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt strongly of them. But, then I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking. I explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea. After that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry out a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was watching the doctor examine the body.",0
"This is an exact reproduction of it: [Illustration] I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper. Suddenly an idea struck me. “Poirot!” I cried. “This is a fragment of a will!” “Exactly.” I looked up at him sharply. “You are not surprised?” “No,” he said gravely, “I expected it.” I relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his case, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My brain was in a whirl.",0
"I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service.",0
"“Ne vous fâchez pas! Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I will respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?” He was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went together to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained undisturbed as we had left them. Poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening very carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups. “So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray and poured out. Yes. Then she came across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here are the three cups.",0
"Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.",0
"""Yes,"" said Poirot thoughtfully, as he put away the brush, ""one must not permit oneself to be obsessed by one idea. I have been in danger of that. Figure to yourself, my friend, that even here, in this case, I am in danger of it. Those two lines you mentioned, a downstroke and a line at right angles to it, what are they but the beginning of a 4?"" ""Good gracious, Poirot,"" I cried, laughing. ""Is it not absurd? I see the hand of the Big Four everywhere. It is well to employ one's wits in a totally different milieu. Ah! there is Japp come to meet us.",0
"See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they were. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.",0
"s.” “Eh bien?” “Well, they started from Boulogne but they never arrived.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.” “And the bogus car?” “Is still at large.” Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?” “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed.",0
"The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.” The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher. The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below. “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.” I craned my neck over the staircase. “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper.",0
"And think of me sometimes, comfortably putting on weight amidst the fleshpots! Your loving friend, Suzanne Blair. P.S. I am sending you an assortment of frying-pans as a wedding present, and an enormous terrine of pâté de foie gras to remind you of me. There is another letter that I sometimes read. It came a good while after the other and was accompanied by a bulky packet. It appeared to be written from somewhere in Bolivia.",0
"I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily.",0
"But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr.",0
"A crash of crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men were pushing each other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness above. Quick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed down the stairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in the hall. He fumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they yielded, the door swung open. He turned. Annette had disappeared. Tommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What madness possessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood his ground.",0
"There were plenty of books in the villa, and delightful rambles all around, but I chafed sometimes at the forced inactivity of our life, and marvelled at Poirot's state of placid content. Nothing occurred to ruffle our quiet existence, and it was not until the end of June, well within the limit that Poirot had given them, that we had our news of the Big Four. A car drove up to the villa early one morning, such an unusual event in our peaceful life that I hurried down to satisfy my curiosity. I found Poirot talking to a pleasant-faced young fellow of about my own age. He introduced me.",0
"“What says the master detective, eh?” asked Hawker, clapping him on the back. “Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.” “You think not?” “What could there be?” “Well, for example, there is the window.” “The window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in that way. I noticed it specially.” “And why were you able to notice it?” The doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain. “It is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd, that. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.” “Well, what of it?” “Very black,” repeated Poirot.",0
"Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective.",0
"Paynter kept up a fair staff at Croftlands six servants as well as his own Chinese body servant Ah Ling."" ""His Chinese servant, Ah Ling,"" murmured Poirot. ""On Tuesday last, Mr. Paynter complained of feeling unwell after dinner, and one of the servants was despatched to fetch the doctor. Mr. Paynter received the doctor in his study, having refused to go to bed. What passed between them was not then known, but before Doctor Quentin left, he asked to see the housekeeper, and mentioned that he had given Mr.",0
"Hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay on the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having managed to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy, lying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart. Madame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep, she had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries, they had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous “secret.",0
"Carter nodded. “Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands; to-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic blunder. If its terms were made public, it would mean disaster It might possibly bring about another war not with Germany this time! That is an extreme possibility, and I do not believe in its likelihood myself, but that document undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to have discredited in any way at the present moment.",0
"""The leg of mutton?"" ""Exactly, Hastings, the leg of mutton. Everybody swore that no one had been to Granite Bungalow that morning, but, nevertheless, I found in the larder a leg of mutton, still frozen. It was Monday, so the meat must have been delivered that morning; for if on Saturday, in this hot weather, it would not have remained frozen over Sunday. So some one had been to the Bungalow, and a man on whom a trace of blood here and there would attract no attention."" ""Damned ingenious!"" cried Ingles approvingly. ""Yes, he is clever, Number Four."" ""As clever as Hercule Poirot?"" I murmured.",0
"It was clear to me that I must have some kind of standing. I couldn’t go on avoiding explanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay ready to my hand, though I didn’t think of it for some time. The Daily Budget! My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn. He was marked down as “The Man in the Brown Suit” through no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be against him.",0
"“Then I shan’t drink it,” said Tuppence firmly. “I’d much rather be shot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might hear it. But I won’t be killed off quietly like a lamb.” Mrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot. “Don’t be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and cry for murder out after me? If you’ve any sense at all, you’ll realize that poisoning you wouldn’t suit my book at all. It’s a sleeping draught, that’s all. You’ll wake up to-morrow morning none the worse. I simply don’t want the bother of tying you up and gagging you.",0
"The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken since you were in Florence at the time. And yet” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where er where” “ did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow.",0
"We were hurried through the woods at a break-neck pace, going uphill the whole time. At last we emerged in the open, on the mountain-side, and I saw just in front of us an extraordinary conglomeration of fantastic rocks and boulders. This must be the Felsenlabyrynth of which Harvey had spoken. Soon we were winding in and out of its recesses. The place was like a maze devised by some evil genie. Suddenly we stopped. An enormous rock barred our path.",0
"le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “Eh bien! Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.” “Ah, par exemple,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.",0
"At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the case for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the trial. And ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my friend. I must not appear in the case.” “What?” “No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish must think I am working for her husband, not against him.",0
"Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All seemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will. Here it is.” Poirot ran through the document. “So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor who is he, by the way?” “M. Renauld’s secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once or twice for a week-end.” “And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise. Simply drawn up, but perfectly legal.",0
"I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited.",0
"” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused. “Go on what next?” “I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links ” Again I paused.",0
"""Have you the will or a copy of it with you?” Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it, nodding to himself. “Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also 11 a.m. that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made even half-an-hour later would upset this. Eh bien, mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you.",0
"How would they decide? And all the while that this agonized questioning went on within him, he talked flippantly to Conrad, enraging the cross-grained doorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania. At last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to Conrad to return. “Let’s hope the judge hasn’t put his black cap on,” remarked Tommy frivolously. “That’s right, Conrad, march me in. The prisoner is at the bar, gentlemen.” The German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to Tommy to sit down opposite to him. “We accept,” he said harshly, “on terms.",0
"It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole household was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done. “Try going through Mr. Inglethorp’s room, sir,” cried Dorcas. “Oh, the poor mistress!” Suddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us that he alone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his room.",0
"Lawrence was away from home part of June.” “In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what would be done with it?” “It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.” “By you?” “No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard who would attend to anything like that.” Evelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was questioned as to the parcel. “Don’t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can’t remember one special one.” “You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales, or whether it was put in his room?” “Don’t think it was sent after him.",0
"“We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,” explained John, “and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important papers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through carefully.” “Yes,” said the lawyer, “it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession.” “There is a later will.” It was Poirot who spoke. “What?” John and the lawyer looked at him startled. “Or, rather,” pursued my friend imperturbably, “there was one.” “What do you mean there was one? Where is it now?” “Burnt!” “Burnt?” “Yes. See here.",0
"The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.” He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly. “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously. Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring: “Not precisely to-day,” he replied. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor.",0
"“At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn’t want to go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the carriage there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just opposite.",0
"Paynter a hypodermic injection as his heart was in a very weak state, recommended that he should not be disturbed, and then proceeded to ask some rather curious questions about the servants how long they had been there, from whom they had come, etc. ""The housekeeper answered these questions as best she could, but was rather puzzled as to their purport. A terrible discovery was made on the following morning. One of the housemaids, on descending, was met by a sickening odour of burned flesh which seemed to come from her master's study. She tried the door, but it was locked on the inside.",0
"Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate: “I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I hoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback.",0
"We’ve suspected it but couldn’t get any proof. Yes, you’ve done very well, young man. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very little time very little time indeed.” “But ” Tommy hesitated. Mr. Carter read his thoughts. “We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It’s a toss-up but we’ve got a sporting chance! But if that draft treaty turns up we’re done. England will be plunged in anarchy. Ah, what’s that? The car? Come on, Beresford, we’ll go and have a look at this house of yours.” Two constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An inspector reported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter turned to Tommy.",0
"Jewels, ready money, bearer bonds all so conveniently arranged for whom? Well, the good Monsieur Davenheim was of those who ‘look after Number One’ as your saying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged for himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery! How simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put away in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track.",0
"It’s an interesting little place.” “Does she go there every day?” “She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays. Those are her only times off.” “I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle Cynthia is clever oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.” “Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.” “Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they have very strong poisons there?” “Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little cupboard.",0
"""Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, petite, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound.",0
"” There was a hoarse murmur. “That’s all right, gov’nor.” And then after a moment or two: “Suppose I’m nabbed.” “You will have the best legal talent to defend you,” replied the German quietly. “But in any case you will wear gloves fitted with the finger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have little to fear.” “Oh, I ain’t afraid, gov’nor. All for the good of the cause. The streets is going to run with blood, so they say.” He spoke with a grim relish. “Dreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds and pearls rolling about in the gutter for anyone to pick up!” Tommy heard a chair shifted.",0
"It is very kind of you to promise to find my child for me, but, you see, I happen to know that you would not succeed, and so that would be a very one-sided bargain, would it not?"" ""Madame, I swear to you by the Holy Angels that I will restore your child to you."" ""I asked you before, M. Poirot, could you restore the dead to life?"" ""Then the child is "" ""Dead? Yes."" He stepped forward and took her wrist. ""Madame, I I who speak to you, swear once more. I will bring the dead to life."" She stared at him as though fascinated. ""You do not believe me. I will prove my words. Get my pocket-book which they took from me.",0
"Oh, you English! With nous autres it is different. Figure to yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war fled to Ostend. There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves. Impossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a horror mais une horreur! of the sea! What was she to do? Daily les Boches were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible situation!” “What did she do?” I inquired curiously. “Fortunately her husband was homme pratique. He was also very calm, the crises of the nerves, they affected him not.",0
"Mr. Inglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to say where you were at six o’clock on Monday afternoon?” With a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in his hands. Poirot approached and stood over him. “Speak!” he cried menacingly. With an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly and deliberately, he shook his head. “You will not speak?” “No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say.",0
"""But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow.",0
"He rubbed his hands together, and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him. ‘Ah!’ he said. ‘So our young friend is coming round again. Capital. Capital.’ “I did the usual stunt. Said: ‘What’s happened?’ And ‘Where am I?’ But I knew the answer to the last well enough. There’s no moss growing on my brain. ‘I think that’ll do for the present, sister,’ said the little man, and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk well-trained way. But I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed through the door. “That look of hers gave me an idea.",0
"My poor aunt what lives in the country has been mortal bad for a long time, and she’s asking for me with her dying breath.” Tommy nodded approval. “Can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing Cross in an hour’s time?” “I’ll be there, sir. You can count on me.” As Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable ally. The two took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To Albert fell the task of collecting information. There was no difficulty about it. Astley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams.",0
"Tuppence read it over her shoulder. Mr. Carter would have recognized it. It referred to the mysterious man found dead in New York. “As I was saying to Miss Tuppence,” resumed the lawyer, “I set to work to prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block was the undeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an assumed name. When I came across this paragraph my problem was solved. Julius Hersheimmer set out to discover what had become of his cousin. He went out West, where he obtained news of her and her photograph to aid him in his search. On the eve of his departure from New York he was set upon and murdered.",0
"They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any price, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs.",0
"He suggested to her repeatedly that it was four-thirty, and not four o’clock when she had heard the voices. But Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed between the time when she had heard the voices and five o’clock, when she had taken tea to her mistress. The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village. Poirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence. The preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John Cavendish gave evidence of identification.",0
"“Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.” There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks. “You know?” she gasped. “How?” I smiled. “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters” “Miss Marvell? She has been here?” “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same.",0
""" It was at half-past eleven exactly that the summons came. A petit bleu. Poirot tore it open, then handed it to me. It was from Madame Olivier, the world-famous scientist, whom we had visited yesterday in connection with the Halliday case. It asked us to come out to Passy at once. We obeyed the summons without an instant's delay. Madame Olivier received us in the same small salon. I was struck anew with the wonderful power of this woman, with her long nun's face and burning eyes this brilliant successor of Becquerel and the Curies. She came to the point at once.",0
"He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that.",0
"And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said: “But certainly. Ask them to enter.” In another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil. She was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue.",0
"As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed.",0
"“And, naming no names, there’s one in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it was when first he darkened the threshold.” Poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his business-like tone, he asked: “Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?” “Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday ” “What time was that?” “I couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way. Perhaps four o’clock or it may have been a bit later.",0
"Young Bleibner, some years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular will, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.",0
"’ Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched. Wisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be dangerous? he retires gracefully with an enormous fortune!” “H’m!” said the Count doubtfully. “It is rather upsetting for all of us. We are at a loose end, as it were.” “But we are being paid off on a most generous scale!” Something, some undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her sharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity.",0
"The Flemmings took in the Daily Budget, and the Daily Budget was having a day after its own heart. EXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT. WOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station.",0
"“They were there when I went down to dinner.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case.” “Who locked up the jewel-case?” “I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.” She held it up as she spoke. The inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders. “The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the jewel-case?” “I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.” “You didn’t lock the drawer?” “No, I never do.",0
"It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House.",0
"But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth.",0
"Inglethorp’s large sized bottle of medicine when it came from Coot’s? The risk is practically nil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have forgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her quarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her absence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too clever and that was their undoing.",0
"No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you.",0
"Shall we go in?” A policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They had also had orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member of the party was unknown to them. The three entered the house, pulling the door to behind them. Slowly they mounted the rickety stairs. At the top was the ragged curtain hiding the recess where Tommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had heard the story from Jane in her character of “Annette.” She looked at the tattered velvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it moved as though some one was behind it.",0
"I never did quite swallow that scar. Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track. She wants the glory of discovering him for herself and the Daily Budget. Young women are very cold-blooded nowadays. I hinted to her that it was an unwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she run him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn’t like it, either, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may all be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs.",0
"” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.",0
"In this sealed and closed chamber, with its close-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the sinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as he would, no one could ever hear him. The place was a living tomb With an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the bed and gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly; also, he was hungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting. “Anyway,” said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, “I shall see the chief the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in bluffing I shall see the mysterious Jane Finn also.",0
"“M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you.",0
"She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “Please there’s a dear.” I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me.",0
"And never have I needed that more than now!” “What is the trouble?” I asked. With a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built up edifice. “It is this, mon ami! That I can build card houses seven stories high, but I cannot” thump “find” thump “ that last link of which I spoke to you.” I could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began slowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so. “It is done so! By placing one card on another with mathematical precision!” I watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story.",0
"He came in that way, killed the old man, and went back to the kitchen. He had stepped in the blood; see the stains he left as he went out? Nothing to be seen in the kitchen all the village has been walking about in it. He went into his own room no, first he went back again to the scene of the crime was that to get the little jade figures? Or had he forgotten something that might incriminate him?"" ""Perhaps he killed the old man the second time he went in?"" I suggested. ""Mais non, you do not observe.",0
"Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.",0
"“That was a very interesting story you told us last night,” I said, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always interested in diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.” “And what happened to him eventually, I mean. Does any one know?” Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions.",0
"But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on the right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I leap!” And, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window. “What is your remarkable little friend doing?” asked a voice behind me, and I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did I. “What is it all about?” “Really, I can’t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell, and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as you see!” Mary laughed.",0
"Once, purely by chance, I happened to see the entries in his pass-book he had asked me to verify some small item and I noticed the paying out of a huge sum a huge sum even for Poirot who was coining money nowadays to some Russian with apparently every letter of the alphabet in his name. But he gave no clue as to the line on which he proposed to operate. Only over and over again he gave utterance to one phrase. ""It is the greatest mistake to underestimate your adversary. Remember that, mon ami."" And I realised that that was the pitfall he was striving at all costs to avoid.",0
"She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John’s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.",0
"“Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England’s Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention.",0
"A sane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane, they say. I guess I was like that. Playing my part had become second nature to me. I wasn’t even unhappy in the end just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the years went on. “And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came down from London. She and the doctor asked me questions, experimented with various treatments. There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that seemed to show that other people friends were looking for me.",0
"I had the girl’s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn’t got it on you a minute ago?” “Yes, I had,” I replied. “It was in my stocking.” “I don’t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table.",0
"""It is very interesting, all this that you are able to tell us, mademoiselle, about Mr. Darrell. Women are such wonderful observers they see everything, they notice the little detail that escapes the mere man. I have seen a woman identify one man out of a dozen others and why, do you think? She had observed that he had a trick of stroking his nose when he was agitated. Now would a man ever have thought of noticing a thing like that?"" ""Did you ever!"" cried Miss Monro. ""I suppose we do notice things.",0
""" The Inspector paused triumphantly. ""What do you think of that, gentlemen?"" ""I think,"" said Poirot, ""that it appears a very clear case of a surprising clearness, in fact. This Biggs, or Grant, he must be a man very foolish and uneducated, eh?"" ""Oh, he is that a rough, common sort of fellow. No idea of what a footprint may mean."" ""Clearly he reads not the detective fiction! Well, Inspector, I congratulate you. We may look at the scene of the crime. Yes?"" ""I'll take you there myself this minute. I'd like you to see those footprints."" ""I, too, should like to see them.",0
"Count Foscatini. There’s been an accident there, I understand.” The man stared at him. “First I’ve heard of it. Mr. Graves that’s Count Foscatini’s man went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.” “Is the Count alone in the flat?” “No, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.” “What are they like?” I asked eagerly. We were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on which Flat II was situated. “I didn’t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were foreign gentlemen.” He pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing. No. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell.",0
"Poirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was the latter functionary who requested that the household, with the exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the drawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot to make his boast good. Personally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for his belief in Inglethorp’s innocence, but a man of the type of Summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot could supply. Before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of which Japp closed.",0
"Part of me was appalled at the sudden disaster, and another part of me was coolly and dispassionately interested in the methods employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back onto the platform. “Let me pass, please. I am a medical man.” A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the motionless body. As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me. The thing wasn’t real couldn’t be. Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head. “Dead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.” We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice.",0
"And in the grate were the identical four knobs of coal I had carefully spilt there. Poirot had followed my glance. ""But yes, that was a famous idea of yours that and the books. See you, if they should say to me any time. 'That friend of yours, that Hastings, he has not the great brain, is it not so?' I shall reply to them: 'You are in error.' It was an idea magnificent and superb that occurred to you there."" ""You understood their meaning then?"" ""Am I an imbecile? Of course I understood. It gave me just the warning I needed, and the time to mature my plans.",0
"“That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot.",0
"” They arrived on the platform just as the train came to a standstill. Tuppence opened the door of an empty first-class compartment, and the two girls sank down breathless on the padded seats. A man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane started nervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked questioningly at Tuppence. “Is he one of them, do you think?” she breathed. Tuppence shook her head. “No, no. It’s all right.” She took Jane’s hand in hers. “Tommy wouldn’t have told us to do this unless he was sure we’d be all right.” “But he doesn’t know them as I do!” The girl shivered. “You can’t understand.",0
"“You have a little idea, I see, mon ami! Capital. We progress.” I sat up, and lit a pipe. “Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say we although I dare say I would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.” “And who is that?” inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes. “Georges Conneau!” The next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. “Enfin! You have arrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning. You are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.",0
"I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these ‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life.",0
"Pagett is staying behind here you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia which is very annoying, because I want to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural.",0
"If otherwise, our enemy will come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared!” From a drawer in the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat pocket. “Now we’re ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you, Miss Tuppence ” “I should think so indeed!” “But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be perfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she has been through.” But to Tuppence’s surprise Jane shook her head. “No. I guess I’m going too. Those papers were my trust. I must go through with this business to the end.",0
"He is a great invalid."" ""That is a pity, but perhaps you will kindly help me instead. You are Mademoiselle Daviloff, are you not?"" ""Yes, I am Sonia Daviloff. What is it you want to know?"" ""I am making some inquiries about that sad affair the night before last the death of M. Gilmour Wilson. What can you tell me about it?"" The girl's eyes opened wide. ""He died of heart failure as he was playing chess."" ""The police are not so sure that it was heart failure, mademoiselle."" The girl gave a terrified gesture. ""It was true then,"" she cried. ""Ivan was right.",0
"Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish’s conduct was just as inexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing was explained quite naturally.” “So,” I cried, a light breaking in upon me, “it was John who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon?” “Exactly.” “And you have known this all along?” “Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish’s behaviour could only be explained that way.” “And yet you say he may be acquitted?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Certainly I do.",0
"""You mean ?"" asked Crowther, impressed in spite of himself by the gravity of Poirot's tone. ""I mean, monsieur, that since I have penetrated the identity of Number Four, my life is not worth an hour's purchase. He will seek to destroy me at all costs and not for nothing is he named 'The Destroyer.' Messieurs, I salute you. To you, M. Crowther, I deliver this key, and this sealed envelope. I have got together all my notes on the case, and my ideas as to how best to meet the menace that any day may break upon the world, and have placed them in a certain safe deposit. In the event of my death, M.",0
"""You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile.",0
"""Only in England is the coffee so atrocious,"" he remarked. ""On the continent they understand how important it is for the digestion that it should be properly made."" As he finished speaking, the man from the next table suddenly appeared on the terrace. Without any hesitation, he came over and drew up a third chair to our table. ""You do not mind my joining you, I hope,"" he said in English. ""Not at all, monsieur,"" said Poirot. I felt very uneasy.",0
"At a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and Tuppence went to answer it with some inward trepidation. She was relieved to see that the visitor was the second of the two men whom Tommy had taken upon himself to follow. He gave his name as Count Stepanov. Tuppence announced him, and Mrs. Vandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick murmur of pleasure. “It is delightful to see you, Boris Ivanovitch,” she said. “And you, madame!” He bowed low over her hand. Tuppence returned to the kitchen.",0
"The lawyer shrugged his shoulders. “There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony would not pass muster in the witness-box.” The hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd. Tuppence’s spirits revived to the normal. “Hooray!” she said. “It’s going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely. I shall ask Mr.",0
"Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.",0
"The rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out.",0
"Good evening.” He raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself. “The adventures have begun,” she murmured to herself. “What does he want me to do, I wonder? There’s something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I don’t like at all. But, on the other hand, I’m not the least bit afraid of you.",0
"“Do you think this is the end? If so, you’re wrong. It’s just the beginning!” “The beginning of what?” “Of our adventure! Tommy, don’t you see, if they are scared enough to run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn business! Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. We’ll run them down! We’ll be sleuths in earnest!” “Yes, but there’s no one left to sleuth.” “No, that’s why we’ll have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of pencil. Thanks. Wait a minute don’t interrupt.",0
"I have met people who enjoy a channel crossing; men who can sit calmly in their deck-chairs and, on arrival, wait until the boat is moored, then gather their belongings together without fuss and disembark. Personally, I can never manage this. From the moment I get on board I feel that the time is too short to settle down to anything. I move my suit-cases from one spot to another, and if I go down to the saloon for a meal, I bolt my food with an uneasy feeling that the boat may arrive unexpectedly whilst I am below.",0
"They don’t want to discourage me altogether. On the other hand, they don’t want to make it too easy. I’m a pawn in their game, Albert, that’s what I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that promising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who’s blundered in just at the right moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!” Tommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had elaborated a careful plan for the following evening.",0
"It was good-bye to the good old world. In spite of myself, my voice wobbled a little as I answered. ""For the last time, no! To hell with your letter!"" Then involuntarily I closed my eyes and breathed a short prayer. Not often in a life-time does a man stand on the edge of eternity, but when I spoke those words in that East End cellar I was perfectly certain that they were my last words on earth. I braced myself for the shock of those black, rushing waters beneath, and experienced in advance the horror of that breath-choking fall. But to my surprise a low laugh fell on my ears. I opened my eyes.",0
"I heard footsteps cautious footsteps, but footsteps nevertheless. I writhed in impotent agony. They came down the path, paused, and then Poirot himself appeared, his head a little on one side, peering into the shadows. I heard the growl of satisfaction Ryland gave as he raised the big automatic and shouted ""Hands up."" Deaves sprang forward as he did so, and took Poirot in the rear. The ambush was complete. ""Please to meet you, Mr. Hercule Poirot,"" said the American grimly. Poirot's self-possession was marvellous. He did not turn a hair.",0
"She now tempted me with the advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the boat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry land. Muffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was hauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay there with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired young man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me. “Hullo! Feeling rather sorry for yourself, eh?” “Yes,” I replied, hating him. “Ah, you won’t know yourself in another day or two. We’ve had rather a nasty dusting in the Bay, but there’s smooth weather ahead.",0
"But, anyway, the valet has most to do with the gentlemen’s rooms.” “I see. Thank you.” Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head. “Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the valet.” I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents. In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same.",0
"Inglethorp did. You will notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and subsequently with two correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it in a sentence, thus: ‘I am possessed.’ Now, what did that tell me? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind, the possibility of a will (a document almost certain to contain that word) occurred to me at once. This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance.",0
"I was on the staff of the Daily Budget, and I had a private word of congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that it was he best so for the present. We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail.",0
"The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed.",0
"""Did you while you happened to be alone for a few seconds unlock the poison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?” “I I may have done so.” “I put it to you that you did do so?” “Yes.” Sir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him. “Did you examine one bottle in particular?” “No, I do not think so.” “Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of Hydro-chloride of Strychnine.” Lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour. “N o I am sure I didn’t.",0
"In the corner, to the right of the fire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man or what had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the telephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the base of it stained with blood. The doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “Stone dead. Must have been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to telephone. It will be better not to move him until the police arrive.” On the manager’s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result was a foregone conclusion.",0
"“You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room.",0
"The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. “23rd May. M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. “24th May. M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “7th June. Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter written to M.",0
"” But, pausing a moment, he added: “Still, it does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the coast.” “The coast?” I asked, puzzled. “What has that got to do with it?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Surely, it is obvious!” “Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp.” “Nothing at all, of course,” replied Poirot, smiling. “But we were speaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.” “Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp ” “What?” cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment.",0
"""Care to come round to the mortuary and see Wilson's body before the doctors start on it? Who knows, his tie-pin may be askew, and that may give you a valuable clue that will solve the mystery."" ""My dear Japp, all through dinner my fingers have been itching to rearrange your own tie-pin. You permit, yes? Ah! that is much more pleasing to the eye. Yes, by all means, let us go to the mortuary."" I could see that Poirot's attention was completely captivated by this new problem. It was so long since he had shown any interest over any outside case that I was quite rejoiced to see him back in his old form.",0
"“It’s almost the last thing I remember before waking up in the hospital” “Go on,” said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. “What do you remember?” She turned to him obediently. “It was at Holyhead. I came that way I don’t remember why” “That doesn’t matter. Go on.” “In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I took a car. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched when we got on the open road. No other car was following us. I saw a path at the side of the road. I told the man to wait.” She paused, then went on.",0
"“There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that, far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.” “Who told you that, mon ami?” “Cynthia herself.” “La pauvre petite! And she was concerned?” “She said that she did not mind at all.” “Then she certainly did mind very much,” remarked Poirot. “They are like that les femmes!” “What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,” I said. “But why? It was most obvious.",0
"""You may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it, and yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the market when Mrs. Robinson arrived.” “That shows that there must be something wrong about it.” “Mrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious, is it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?” “She was a delightful creature!” “Évidemment! since she renders you incapable of replying to my question. Describe her to me, then.",0
"A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler. Lady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward uncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little man was equal to the occasion. “All my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss Marvell’s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure.",0
"When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep.",0
"The possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the Anzora? Ah! voilà une femme, Hastings! What force, what self-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: ‘It does not matter now.’ And no one noticed no one realized the significance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play, poor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and, instead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now.",0
"So far it was all plain sailing. He hadn’t the remotest notion that anyone was on to him. Well, he just sat around in the hotel lounge, reading the papers and so on, till it was time for dinner. He didn’t hurry any over that either. “I began to think that there was nothing doing, that he’d just come on the trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn’t changed for dinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up hotel, so it seemed likely enough that he’d be going out on his real business afterwards. “Sure enough, about nine o’clock, so he did.",0
"To la femme sentiment is everything is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact.” “Of course, of course,” said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. “Still” He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers. With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman. “Oh, oh, my necklace!” She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round. “Where was it?” demanded Opalsen. “Maid’s bed.",0
"My doctor, he assures me that one dies not of it and it is for the one time only; you understand, that never never shall I return."" He pushed me into a chair. ""Come, I will tell you how it all came about. Do you know who is the richest man in the world? Richer even than Rockefeller? Abe Ryland."" ""The American Soap King?"" ""Precisely. One of his secretaries approached me. There is some very considerable, as you would call it, hocus-pocus going on in connection with a big company in Rio. He wished me to investigate matters on the spot. I refused.",0
"He did not immediately recognize Tuppence. When he did, his admiration was unbounded. “Blest if I’d have known you! That rig-out’s top-hole.” “Glad you like it, Albert,” replied Tuppence modestly. “By the way, am I your cousin, or am I not?” “Your voice too,” cried the delighted boy. “It’s as English as anything! No, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie wasn’t best pleased. She’s stopped on till to-day to oblige, she said, but really it’s so as to put you against the place.” “Nice girl,” said Tuppence. Albert suspected no irony. “She’s style about her, and keeps her silver a treat but, my word, ain’t she got a temper.",0
"How they meant to manage the body business originally, I do not know possibly an art student’s skeleton and a fire or something of the kind, but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their hands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the garden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and suddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M. Renauld calls his wife.",0
"You know what women are. She’s all for this film stunt.” “I comprehend,” said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought, then rose briskly to his feet. “You return to Yardly Chase at once? Bien! Say no word to anyone to anyone mind but expect us there this evening. We will arrive shortly after five.” “All right, but I don’t see” “Ça n’a pas d’importance,” said Poirot kindly. “You will that I preserve for you your diamond, n’est-ce pas?” “Yes, but” “Then do as I say.” A sadly bewildered nobleman left the room. It was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs.",0
"""What’s that?” I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa. “Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn’t have done so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at heart disease.” “Yes,” I said doubtfully. “But we don’t know. Perhaps he thought it safer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation.",0
"""Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.” “He was supposed to be in Florence but he certainly never went there. I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved.",0
"“And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?” “Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.” I had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he replied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My pride forbade me to ask any questions. Poirot switched off on another tack. “Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?” “She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.” “Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is like pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that dispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?” “I am sure she would be delighted.",0
"“Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?” “Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!” “And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?” “Certainly they did.",0
"Julius had seen it he showed me a note of hers to him once but Sir James hadn’t! After that everything was plain sailing. I sent off Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but doubled back again. When Julius came bursting up in his car, I felt it wasn’t part of Mr. Brown’s plan and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir James was actually caught in the act, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never believe it of him on my bare word ” “I didn’t,” interposed Mr. Carter ruefully. “That’s why I sent the girls off to Sir James.",0
"“He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, jeune homme?” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said. I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him.",0
"From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd. Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice: “Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?” “No, before the war I was in Lloyd’s.” “And you will return there after it is over?” “Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.” Mary Cavendish leant forward.",0
"“If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started” “My dear fellow,” I interrupted brutally, “that was a bilious attack. You’re always having bilious attacks.” Pagett winced slightly. “It wasn’t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time “For God’s sake, don’t go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don’t want to hear them.” “Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!” “Ah!” I said. “You’ve been talking to Rayburn.” He did not deny it.",0
"Anyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She would meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would beard the lion in his den. When the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading, but Tuppence held firm. “It can do no harm,” was what she always came back to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to Carlton House Terrace. The door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little nervous. After all, perhaps it was colossal cheek on her part.",0
"My mind is in some disorder which is not well.” For about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except for several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh. “It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and classified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear yet no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles me. Me, Hercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.” “And what are they?” “The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very important.",0
"""It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should bury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit of walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?” “No,” I confessed, “I never thought of such a thing.” “He is, of course, a German by birth,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen years ago. A very clever man a Jew, of course.” “The blackguard!” I cried indignantly. “Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot.",0
"“M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you.",0
"But, of course, that all fits in if he's a missing heir. Is it a title, Mr. Poirot?"" ""Alas, a mere heritage,"" said Poirot unblushingly. ""But you see, it may be a question of identification. That is why it is necessary for us to find some one who knew him very well indeed. You knew him very well, did you not, mademoiselle."" ""I don't mind telling you, Mr. Poirot. You're a gentleman. You know how to order a lunch for a lady which is more than some of these young whippersnappers do nowadays. Downright mean, I call it. As I was saying, you being a Frenchman won't be shocked.",0
"Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something that satisfied my aching hunger for romance. Perfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the Kilmorden glided nearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all dreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans are so anxious not to miss anything. “This is South Africa,” I kept saying to myself industriously, “South Africa, South Africa. You are seeing the world. This is the world. You are seeing it. Think of it, Anne Beddingfeld, you pudding-head. You’re seeing the world.",0
"""In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have been posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?” The witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest signified that he was satisfied. Elizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead of leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a slight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and had seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs.",0
"Poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant. It was going to be a hot day. Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that was extraordinary a curious mingling of terror and agitation. “Look, Poirot!” I said. He leant forward. “Tiens!” he said. “It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist’s shop. He is coming here.",0
"“It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute.",0
"Poirot studied the features attentively. “H’m!” he murmured. “Wears his hair rather long and wavy, full moustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?” “Yes.” “Hair and beard turning grey?” The detective nodded. “Well, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to say to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?” “On the contrary, most obscure.” The Scotland Yard man looked pleased. “Which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished Poirot placidly. “Eh?” “I find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear as daylight eh bien, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.” Japp shook his head almost pityingly. “Well, each to their fancy. But it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.” “I do not see,” murmured Poirot.",0
"“You seem to have met your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.” There was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to enter the room. His face lit at the sight of us. “You’re safe, Anne. I was afraid” He turned to Sir Eustace. “I’ve been after you for a long time, Pedler and at last I’ve got you.” “Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,” declared Sir Eustace airily. “These young people have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things.",0
"My original idea was to stay a couple of days or so at the Falls which I’ve never seen, though this is my third visit to Africa and then go on to Jo’burg and study the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I pose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all I hear, Jo’burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit in about a week’s time. I don’t want to study conditions in the midst of a raging revolution.” Race smiled in a rather superior manner. “I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace.",0
"” Dorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was I. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled. “Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key that was lost?” He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs. Dorcas’s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head. “That’s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked everywhere for it.” “Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to-day.",0
"They had an instinct that it would be mere waste of breath. “But what I don’t understand,” said the Prime-Minister suddenly, “is how that photograph came to be in Mr. Hersheimmer’s drawer?” “Perhaps it never left it,” suggested the lawyer gently. “But the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?” “Ah!” said Sir James thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. “I mustn’t keep you. Go on with the affairs of the nation. I must get back to my case.” Two days later Julius Hersheimmer returned from Manchester. A note from Tommy lay on his table: “DEAR HERSHEIMMER, “Sorry I lost my temper. In case I don’t see you again, good-bye.",0
"Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station.",0
"Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon a young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was employed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing at the same time as the papers.",0
"""And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred Inglethorp.” “No,” said Poirot curtly. “Because your instinct is not against Mr. Inglethorp.” “What?” “No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him capable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit it. It tells you more shall I go on?” She was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative movement of the hand. “Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp? It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.",0
"How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully.",0
"Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah.",0
"“Ah, that is just what I do not understand! It is inexplicable stupid! They have all their arrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the abduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost impossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not twenty miles from London!” “Perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other,” I suggested. “Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor in the first affair, anyway.",0
"’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he thinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ But we shall see.…” But my mind had reverted to the main facts. “Then all this story of the masked men ?” “Is false.” “What really happened?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “One person could tell us Madame Renauld. But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my opinion.",0
""" He led the way across the hall, and flung open a door at the back, standing aside to let me pass in. I blinked a little, for the room faced west and the afternoon sun was pouring in. Then my vision cleared and I saw a figure waiting to welcome me with outstretched hands. It was oh, impossible, it couldn't be but yes! ""Poirot!"" I cried, and for once did not attempt to evade the embrace with which he overwhelmed me. ""But yes, but yes, it is indeed I! Not so easy to kill Hercule Poirot!"" ""But Poirot why?"" ""A ruse de guerre, my friend, a ruse de guerre. All is now ready for our grand coup.",0
"The energetic young man had succeeded in making the lives of several Scotland Yard men unbearable to them, and the telephone girls at the Admiralty had learned to know and dread the familiar “Hullo!” He had spent three hours in Paris hustling the Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with the idea, possibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true clue to the mystery was to be found in Ireland. “I dare say he’s dashed off there now,” thought Tuppence. “All very well, but this is very dull for me! Here I am bursting with news, and absolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have wired, or something.",0
"Inglethorp’s husband, of whom he had been bitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to produce an unimpeachable alibi. On the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the quarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in favour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour before her marriage, but and Mr.",0
"I had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor. The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven. The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a cupboard.",0
"Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew.",0
"Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.",0
"I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall, slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman’s that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed, which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body all these things are burnt into my memory. I shall never forget them.",0
"Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball.",0
"Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal paymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run no risk of the hangman’s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their affair.” “Then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?” Poirot made a gesture of anger.",0
"""Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.",0
"""I mean to say, if I have a lot of dooks and earls and viscounts and suchlike down to the country place I've gotten, you'll be able to sort them out all right and put them where they should be round the dining table?"" ""Oh! quite easily,"" I replied, smiling. We exchanged a few more preliminaries, and then I found myself engaged. What Mr. Ryland wanted was a secretary conversant with English society, as he already had an American secretary and a stenographer with him. Two days later I went down to Hatton Chase, the seat of the Duke of Loamshire, which the American millionaire had rented for a period of six months.",0
"There was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it would not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and join you on the balcony.” “I’d forgotten that,” I admitted. “But it was only for a moment.” “Long enough.” “Long enough for what?” Poirot’s smile became rather enigmatical. “Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity.” Our eyes met. Poirot’s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a little tune. I watched him suspiciously.",0
"“Well, what is it? What does Loamsley want? You his secretary? What’s it all about?” “To begin with,” I said with as great an appearance of coolness as I could manage, “I don’t know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows nothing about me. I took his card from the tray in the house of the people I’m staying with, and I wrote those words on it myself. It was important that I should see you.” For a moment it appeared to be a toss up as to whether Lord Nasby had apoplexy or not. In the end, he swallowed twice and got over it. “I admire your coolness, young woman.",0
"So, and only so, could it have happened. Come, let us go back to the house."" ""You want to see Madame Olivier again?"" Poirot gave a curious smile. ""No, Hastings, I want to see the face of the lady on the stairs."" ""Who do you think she is, a relation of Madame Olivier's?"" ""More probably a secretary and a secretary engaged not very long ago."" The same gentle acolyte opened the door to us. ""Can you tell me,"" said Poirot, ""the name of the lady, the widow lady, who came in just now?"" ""Madame Veroneau? Madame's secretary?"" ""That is the lady.",0
"In a speech or an article, or in conversation, each linked Li Chang Yen's name with rioting or revolution, and within a week of his indiscretion each was dead. One was poisoned; one died of cholera, an isolated case not part of an epidemic; and one was found dead in his bed. The cause of the last death was never determined, but I was told by a doctor who saw the corpse that it was burnt and shrivelled as though a wave of electrical energy of incredible power had passed through it."" ""And Li Chang Yen?"" inquired Poirot. ""Naturally nothing is traced to him, but there are signs, eh?"" Mr. Ingles shrugged. ""Oh, signs yes, certainly.",0
"Can you describe him at all?” “I really didn’t notice. He was quite ordinary just like anyone else.” Mr. Carter sighed in his tired manner. “That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a telephone message to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a telephone in the outer office?” Tuppence thought. “No, I don’t think I did.” “Exactly. That ‘message’ was Mr. Brown’s way of giving an order to his subordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of course. Was it after that that Whittington handed you over the money, and told you to come the following day?” Tuppence nodded.",0
"Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on which occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the will which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour valid. The prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his room, by Detective Inspector Japp a most brilliant officer of the identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village chemist’s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder. It would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner’s guilt.",0
"You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What beau temps, is it not? Good day, milord.” And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands. “Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?” “No, mon ami, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.” “How did you get the diamond.” “From Mr. Rolf.” “Rolf?” “Mais oui! The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in Society Gossip, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike bah! they did not exist.",0
"” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t don’t,” I said fiercely.",0
"It never answers.” “I agree with you, mon ami. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.” His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again her voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with empressement: “I will.” Well, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had had time to reflect. I did not like the girl.",0
"As for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only conclude that Poirot was mad. Japp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow. “I daren’t do it, Mr. Poirot. I’d take your word, but there’s others over me who’ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can’t you give me a little more to go on?” Poirot reflected a moment. “It can be done,” he said at last. “I admit I do not wish it. It forces my hand.",0
"I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the “scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to let presumably was still to let.",0
"“She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter.",0
"But in real life there was absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said that morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it going to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale.",0
"Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean that you’re in on that?” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as she regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she remained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically. “Well, if that doesn’t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all the horrors.” “What do you mean?” “What I say. Bless the boy, didn’t I tell you I doted on crimes? What do you think I’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over this stubble? I’ve been nosing round for hours.",0
"She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious whirl and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me.",0
"In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent, that he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that he had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded the mission to South America as connected with business interests. As M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in. “I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.” “By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly. Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table. “Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?” “Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily.",0
"“I’ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,” continued Tuppence. “There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven’t got any rich elderly relatives. Any relatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old ladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case they should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them has ever asked me my name and quite a lot never said ‘Thank you.’” There was a pause.",0
"Then take the packet to the American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassador’s own hands. Is that clear?” “Quite clear.” “Then be ready I’m going to say good-bye.” He took her hand in his. “Good-bye. Good luck to you,” he said in a louder tone. Her hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm. The Lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard. In answer to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat.",0
"The papers must be delivered to us before you go free.” “Idiot!” said Tommy amiably. “How do you think I can look for them if you keep me tied by the leg here?” “What do you expect, then?” “I must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.” The German laughed. “Do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here leaving us a pretty story full of promises?” “No,” said Tommy thoughtfully. “Though infinitely simpler for me, I did not really think you would agree to that plan. Very well, we must arrange a compromise.",0
"” Julius paused. “I thought for sure you’d know all this.” “Julius,” said Tuppence firmly, “stop walking up and down. It makes me giddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole story with as few fancy turns of speech as possible.” Mr. Hersheimmer obeyed. “Sure,” he said. “Where shall I begin?” “Where you left off. At Waterloo.” “Well,” began Julius, “I got into one of your dear old-fashioned first-class British compartments. The train was just off. First thing I knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that I wasn’t in a smoking-carriage.",0
"Schneider to-day.’ And a bit more of the same. Young Bleibner lit out for Cairo right away.” “Was he in perfectly good health at the time?” “The old man?” “No, the young one.” “I believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But it couldn’t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.” “One thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?” “So far as we know, he has not.” “Are you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?” “No, sir, I am not. I’m for New York as soon as I can square up things here.",0
"Cavendish, who had married John’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable fortune of her own. Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish early in their married life.",0
"It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never read the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all did, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.",0
"“I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race.",0
"""I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.” “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning that is so, is it not?” “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me.",0
"I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do.",0
"""Would it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our visitor’s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.” Roger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart appearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently labouring under great agitation. “Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s partner, I understand. It is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.” “I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is ill in bed influenza.” His face fell. “Dear me, that is a great blow to me.",0
"“My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.” “Where have you been?” I asked. “Denby kept me late last night. It was one o’clock before we’d finished. Then I found that I’d forgotten the latch-key after all. I didn’t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.” “How did you hear the news?” I asked. “Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so self-sacrificing such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.” A wave of revulsion swept over me.",0
"""Yes?” “After tea, I want to talk to you.” Her glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred to me to wonder about the girl’s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would probably insist on her making her home with them at any rate until the end of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry to let her go. John, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.",0
"“They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look. “On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?” “Very curious,” I agreed. “And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.",0
"Ah, this cursed sand!” “Come, now, there’s a lot of sand in Belgium,” I reminded him, mindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “les dunes impeccables” as the guide-book had phrased it. “Not in Brussels,” declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids thoughtfully. “It is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid and geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they plant them in rows!” I cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start for the camp.",0
"It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.",0
"“John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member’s wife she was the late Lord Abbotsbury’s daughter does the same. She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a war household; nothing is wasted here every scrap of waste paper, even, is saved and sent away in sacks.” I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out over the park.",0
"Never does. Wish you hadn’t later.” “You’re a cynic, Evie,” said John, laughing. “Where’s tea to-day inside or out?” “Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.” “Come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘The labourer is worthy of his hire’, you know. Come and be refreshed.” “Well,” said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, “I’m inclined to agree with you.” She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore. A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to meet us. “My wife, Hastings,” said John.",0
"Cynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her, and told her of Poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary. “Of course! I’d love him to see it. He’d better come to tea there one day. I must fix it up with him. He’s such a dear little man! But he is funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and put it in again, because he said it wasn’t straight.” I laughed. “It’s quite a mania with him.” “Yes, isn’t it?” We were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction of Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said: “Mr. Hastings.",0
"""And your theory is?” “For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations.” “Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.” “Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.",0
"There’s safety in a crowd.” Poirot turned inquiringly to Japp. “I don’t agree. Get clear away at once that’s the only chance. I would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I’d have a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I’d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began!” We both looked at Poirot. “What do you say, monsieur?” For a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted across his face.",0
"Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe? Yes, it all fitted in. No wonder Miss Howard had suggested “hushing it up.” Now I understood that unfinished sentence of hers: “Emily herself ” And in my heart I agreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of Cavendish. “There’s another thing,” said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound of his voice made me start guiltily. “Something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true.",0
"Where can he hide this terrible slip of paper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case, are sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he dare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees what do you think, mon ami?” I shook my head. “In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle-piece.” I uttered an exclamation. “No one would think of looking there,” Poirot continued.",0
"We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike.",0
"You should always pay attention to your instincts.” “Well then,” I blurted out, “it’s absurd but I suspect Miss Howard of not telling all she knows!” “Miss Howard?” “Yes you’ll laugh at me ” “Not at all. Why should I?” “I can’t help feeling,” I continued blunderingly; “that we’ve rather left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her having been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen miles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively that she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?” “Yes, my friend,” said Poirot unexpectedly, “we can.",0
"Boris, here, knows pretty ways of making people speak!” “Bah!” said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly unpleasant feeling in the pit of his stomach. “You will neither torture me nor kill me.” “And why not?” asked Boris. “Because you’d kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,” replied Tommy quietly. There was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommy’s persistent assurance was at last conquering. They were no longer completely sure of themselves. The man in the shabby clothes stared at Tommy searchingly. “He’s bluffing you, Boris,” he said quietly. Tommy hated him.",0
"The bolt was shot across it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been used for some time. By gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy managed to draw it back without making too much noise. Then he repeated his former manœuvres with the handle this time with complete success. The door swung open a crack, a mere fraction, but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a velvet portière on the inside of this door which prevented him from seeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount of accuracy. The Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was unmistakable: “That’s all very well.",0
"Bloke met me when I came out."" ""What was he like?"" ""Not exactly a parson, but looked like one. Soft black hat and mincing way of talking. Got a broken front tooth. Spectacled chap. Saunders his name was. Said he hoped I was repentant, and that he'd find me a good post. I went to old Whalley on his recommendation."" Poirot rose once more. ""I thank you. I know all now. Have patience."" He paused in the doorway and added: ""Saunders gave you a pair of boots, didn't he?"" Grant looked very astonished. ""Why, yes, he did. But how did you know?"" ""It is my business to know things,"" said Poirot gravely.",0
"After lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to see him. “No, I don’t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.” “Oh!” Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and excited in his manner roused my curiosity. “What is it?” I asked. “I could go if there’s anything special.” “It’s nothing much, but well, if you are going, will you tell him ” he dropped his voice to a whisper “I think I’ve found the extra coffee-cup!” I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot’s, but now my curiosity was aroused afresh.",0
"A man should look after his own people “ Once or twice I have felt afraid. The first time was in Italy. There was a dinner given. Professor D , the great alienist, was present. The talk fell on insanity. He said, ‘A great many men are mad, and no one knows it. They do not know it themselves.’ I do not understand why he looked at me when he said that. His glance was strange I did not like it “ The war has disturbed me I thought it would further my plans. The Germans are so efficient. Their spy system, too, was excellent. The streets are full of these boys in khaki.",0
"""He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal.",0
"“Kind old beggar,” muttered Tommy, as he flung it aside. The door opened, and Julius burst in with his usual violence. He held an open newspaper in his hand. “Say, what’s all this? They seem to have got some fool idea about Tuppence.” “It’s true,” said Tommy quietly. “You mean they’ve done her in?” Tommy nodded. “I suppose when they got the treaty she wasn’t any good to them any longer, and they were afraid to let her go.” “Well, I’m darned!” said Julius. “Little Tuppence. She sure was the pluckiest little girl ” But suddenly something seemed to crack in Tommy’s brain. He rose to his feet.",0
"I took her hands in both of mine. My eyes said the rest. Poirot cleared his throat. “Mes enfants,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “Très bien, mon enfant,” said Poirot.",0
"I showed them all our exhibits. I am disappointed in Japp. He has no method!” “Hullo!” I said, looking out of the window. “Here’s Dr. Bauerstein. I believe you’re right about that man, Poirot. I don’t like him.” “He is clever,” observed Poirot meditatively. “Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!” And I described the doctor’s adventure. “He looked a regular scarecrow! Plastered with mud from head to foot.” “You saw him, then?” “Yes.",0
"""Who is Ivan, and why do you say he was right?"" ""It was Ivan who opened the door to you and he has already said to me that in his opinion Gilmour Wilson did not die a natural death that he was poisoned by mistake."" ""By mistake."" ""Yes, the poison was meant for my uncle."" She had quite forgotten her first distrust now, and was speaking eagerly. ""Why do you say that, mademoiselle. Who should wish to poison Dr. Savaronoff?"" She shook her head. ""I do not know. I am all in the dark. And my uncle, he will not trust me. It is natural, perhaps. You see, he hardly knows me.",0
"“Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not not where” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying. I felt my bona fides was now quite established. “And perhaps I might get it cheap in the circumstances.” A master touch that, I thought. “Well, it’s possible. There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now servants and all that, you know.",0
"He led the way through the house to the room where the tragedy had occurred Mr. Paynter's study. It was a wide, low room, with book-lined walls and big leather arm-chairs. Poirot looked across at once to the window which gave upon a gravelled terrace. ""The window, it was unlatched?"" he asked. ""That's the whole point, of course. When the doctor left this room, he merely closed the door behind him. The next morning it was found locked. Who locked it? Mr. Paynter? Ah Ling declares that the window was closed and bolted. Dr.",0
"Perhaps Number Fourteen will shut the door?” In another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels, and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard had stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook, he must hear more. There was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that the doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for a minute or two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage was deserted. Tommy bent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving them behind the curtain, he walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet, and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack.",0
"A tall man, with a buttoned-up overcoat and a soft hat. He is wanted by the police."" Very few minutes elapsed before we heard a noise in the corridor outside. The key was turned and the door flung open. The manager himself stood in the doorway. ""The man you have got him?"" I cried. ""No, monsieur. No one has descended."" ""You must have passed him."" ""We have passed no one, monsieur. It is incredible that he can have escaped."" ""You have passed some one, I think,"" said Poirot, in his gentle voice.",0
"As soon as I found that the Countess Rossakoff was mixed up with the Big Four, I had every possible inquiry made as to her antecedents. I learnt that she had had a child who was reported to have been killed, and I also found that there were discrepancies in the story which led me to wonder whether it might not, after all, be alive. In the end, I succeeded in tracing the boy, and by paying out a big sum I obtained possession of the child's person. The poor little fellow was nearly dead of starvation. I placed him in a safe place, with kindly people, and took a snapshot of him in his new surroundings.",0
"40 on the following afternoon and depart again at 6. I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed to me a good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was getting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got another chance. The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from Johannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram: “Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.” Eric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name I dislike exceedingly.",0
"“I know you did.” “But John! My old friend John!” “Every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,” observed Poirot philosophically. “You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.” “I must say I think you might have given me a hint.” “Perhaps, mon ami, I did not do so, just because he was your old friend.” I was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed on to John what I believed to be Poirot’s views concerning Bauerstein. He, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him. Nevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings were pretty well clipped for the future.",0
"How should I not know you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.” “You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!” said my friend grandiloquently. “It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.” “We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge. “The injury is serious, then?” I asked. “What injury?” “The bullet wound.” “Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.” “As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed.",0
"She can typewrite, I know, for she told me so.” To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not like Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he has displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries nowadays. Just to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has extremely nice legs.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I don’t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first sight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out on deck.",0
"Poirot was alternately silent and loquacious. He would sit staring out of the window like a man lost in a dream, apparently not hearing a word that I said to him. Then, reverting to animation suddenly, he would shower injunctions and commands upon me, and urge the necessity of constant marconigrams. We had a long fit of silence just after we passed Woking. The train, of course, did not stop anywhere until Southampton; but just here it happened to be held up by a signal. ""Ah! Sacré mille tonnerres!"" cried Poirot suddenly. ""But I have been an imbecile. I see clearly at last.",0
"You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?” “No.” “You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of the crime?” “No,” I exclaimed, astonished. “Impossible!” “Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when I asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were the bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male impersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more evidence against her than anyone else.” “You are joking, Poirot!” “No.",0
"Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here and here ” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have been careful to obliterate them but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?” “Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable.",0
"“I was an awful mug right up to the time I found that photograph of Annette, and realized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered how persistently she had shouted out that word ‘Marguerite’ and I thought of the pictures, and well, that’s that. Then of course I went over the whole thing to see where I’d made an ass of myself.” “Go on,” said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking refuge in silence once more. “That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me about it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir James must have done the trick. But I didn’t know which.",0
"Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.",0
"“Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It was about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of got it into my head that, if I climbed up that tree, I’d very likely be able to see into that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than in any other less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess I’d got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up.",0
"Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs.",0
"He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you must have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room her boudoir,” he explained.",0
"To begin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion of his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him to Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet he was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must have lent him the money.” “All that was very thin,” I objected. “But there was more.",0
"""I've got a photograph if that would be any good?"" ""You have a photograph?"" Poirot almost sprang from his seat with excitement. ""It's quite an old one eight years old at least."" ""Ça ne fait rien! No matter how old and faded! Ah, ma foi, but what stupendous luck! You will permit me to inspect that photograph, mademoiselle?"" ""Why, of course."" ""Perhaps you will even permit me to have a copy made? It would not take long."" ""Certainly if you like."" Miss Monro rose. ""Well, I must run away,"" she declared archly. ""Very glad to have met you and your friend, Mr. Poirot.",0
"“Then the papers,” said Sir James slowly, “are still at the back of the picture in that room.” “Yes.” The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the strain of the long story. Sir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch. “Come,” he said, “we must go at once.” “To-night?” queried Tuppence, surprised. “To-morrow may be too late,” said Sir James gravely. “Besides, by going to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man and super-criminal Mr.",0
"Nevertheless, many spiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her lover and not the only one! When the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another personage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of the United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming and mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful. About this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried on her husband’s behalf.",0
"I have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point.” The Daily Newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events. Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed.",0
"Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne.” A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him covered with the revolver. “So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up.",0
"We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. “Alias the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there was something more behind. “You haven’t caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.",0
"” The case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb of Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomb a belief which, as Poirot pointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought. “Poirot,” I said, “a change of air would do you good.” “You think so, mon ami?” “I am sure of it.” “Eh eh?” said my friend, smiling. “It is all arranged, then?” “You will come?” “Where do you propose to take me?” “Brighton.",0
"He never wavered in his belief that our present plan was the only one likely to be crowned by success. ""As a minor point, Hastings,"" he remarked one day, ""I was in continual fear of your death lying at my door. And that rendered me nervous like a cat upon the jumps, as you say. But now I am well satisfied.",0
"I have made the inquiries a lot of quarrying of stone and mineral deposits is done there, and the company, apparently a small Italian firm, is in reality controlled by Abe Ryland. I am prepared to swear that a vast subterranean dwelling has been hollowed out in the very heart of the mountain, secret and inaccessible. From there the leaders of the organisation will issue by wireless their orders to their followers who are numbered by thousands in every country. And from that crag in the Dolomites the dictators of the world will emerge.",0
"""I've read of super criminals many a time, but I've never come across them. Well, you've heard Captain Kent's story. Anything further I can do for you?"" ""Yes, my good friend. You can give me the address of Mrs. Halliday and also a few words of introduction to her if you will be so kind."" Thus it was that the following day saw us bound for Chetwynd Lodge, near the village of Chobham in Surrey. Mrs. Halliday received us at once, a tall, fair woman, nervous and eager in manner. With her was her little girl, a beautiful child of five. Poirot explained the purpose of our visit.",0
"Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her.",0
"He repels me and at the same time fascinates me; but I know one thing, I’m always a little afraid of him.” “He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley robbery,” said Harry slowly. “But it was he who told Suzanne all about the ‘Colonel’ and how he had been in Paris trying to get on his track.” “Camouflage_ of a particularly clever kind.” “But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race’s pay?” “Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, “he doesn’t come in at all.” “What?” “Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s own account of that night on the Kilmorden?” “Yes through Sir Eustace.” I repeated it. Harry listened closely.",0
"“Here’s your five shillings. Come on, Julius. We must find that telegram.” They hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door. The room was as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled ball of orange and white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out the telegram. “Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great developments TOMMY.” They looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first: “You didn’t send it?” “Of course not. What does it mean?” “I guess it means the worst,” said Julius quietly. “They’ve got her.” “What?” “Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap like a lamb.” “My God! What shall we do?” “Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There’s no time to waste.",0
"“It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows.",0
"The accident had taken place in Trafalgar Square. “Do you think the collision was an accident, or done deliberately?” “I don’t know. It might have been either.” Hand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along. “It may be my fancy,” said Tuppence suddenly, “but I feel as though there was some one behind us.” “Hurry!” murmured the other. “Oh, hurry!” They were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their spirits lightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated man barred their way. “Good evening, ladies,” he hiccupped.",0
"My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.",0
"“This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk. “Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.” Poirot laughed. “The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘Tiens! The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back.",0
"Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel my passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do. You’ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps.” At that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped forward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction. “Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black.” A few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited the fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn.",0
"You see I care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?” “No,” I whispered. “It was since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand and it frightened me.",0
"There will be no great danger in Jo’burg.” The women immediately looked at him in the “What a brave hero you are” manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as Race but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it all their own way. “I suppose you’ll be there,” I said coldly. “Very possibly. We might travel together.” “I’m not sure that I shan’t stay on at the Falls a bit,” I answered non-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo’burg? He’s got his eye on Anne, I believe. “What are your plans, Miss Anne?” “That depends,” she replied demurely, copying me.",0
"Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia was in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother’s room, and saw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that Mademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly driven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his feet, remembering that she had gone up with his mother the night before, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents.",0
"If Miss Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against Alfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions, which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.” He paused a minute, then went on. “Now, to my way of thinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard’s being the murderess.",0
"“Ah, quelle idée! Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Eh bien, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris, and tell me what you make of it!” “I see,” I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot’s remarks bore in upon me. “That letter was written to Jack Renauld not to his father. He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.” Poirot nodded. “Précisement! We can return to this point later.",0
"” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the salon door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?” The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality.",0
"Inglethorp’s death, who would inherit her money?” The lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied: “The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish does not object ” “Not at all,” interpolated John. “I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her last will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant legacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson, Mr. John Cavendish.” “Was not that pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish rather unfair to her other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?” “No, I do not think so.",0
"I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped. To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.",0
"In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “Ma foi! but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.",0
"In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg.",0
"“You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely.",0
"“And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er the Madonna er Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So picturesque on the banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered.",0
"“Cocoa with I think rum in it.” He passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had been overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys, and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about. “Ah, this is curious,” said Poirot. “I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.” “You do not? Observe the lamp the chimney is broken in two places; they lie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed to powder.” “Well,” I said wearily, “I suppose someone must have stepped on it.",0
"“We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “My dearest one:” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid.",0
"He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me.",0
"No suspicion attaches to her. No notice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the strychnine and glasses in John’s room. She puts the beard in the attic. She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.” “I don’t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,” I remarked. “It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to Lawrence.” “Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out of pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to the pair of schemers.” “His manner was unfortunate,” I observed thoughtfully. “Yes.",0
"There is a certain notoriety given to these cases. And the girl was very young nineteen, I believe. It seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked about might damage her prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such cases. It is really a matter of waiting.” “Waiting?” “Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return as suddenly as it went. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the intervening period, and will take up life where she left off at the sinking of the Lusitania.",0
"What she saw in the man I cannot imagine, but she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for long expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to see his attraction. The 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous bazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection with the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War poem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take place.",0
"Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one.",0
"That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly ” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot.",0
"""Leave us, Sonia."" She disappeared obediently. ""Now, sir, what is it?"" ""Dr. Savaronoff, you have recently come into an enormous fortune. If you should die unexpectedly, who inherits it?"" ""I have made a will leaving everything to my niece, Sonia Daviloff. You do not suggest "" ""I suggest nothing, but you have not seen your niece since she was a child. It would have been easy for any one to impersonate her."" Savaronoff seemed thunderstruck by the suggestion. Poirot went on easily. ""Enough as to that. I give you the word of warning, that is all.",0
"What could one do with a man like that? “Of course, if it’s so dreadful that you’d be ashamed to speak of it to me” I began spitefully. At last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed. “Dreadful? Ashamed? I don’t understand you.” “Then tell me.” In three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett’s secret! It was not in the least what I expected. I walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me. I tore it open.",0
"What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong.",0
"""Oh, well, that’s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia another day.” I told him about the letter. “I am sorry for that,” he said. “I always had hopes of that letter. But no, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.” He tapped his forehead. “These little grey cells. It is ‘up to them’ as you say over here.” Then, suddenly, he asked: “Are you a judge of finger-marks, my friend?” “No,” I said, rather surprised, “I know that there are no two finger-marks alike, but that’s as far as my science goes.” “Exactly.” He unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he laid on the table.",0
"I realised that we were penetrating into the Ardennes, and I suddenly remembered Poirot's saying that he had a brother who lived at Spa. But we did not go to Spa itself. We left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills, till we reached a little hamlet, and an isolated white villa high on the hill-side. Here the car stopped in front of the green door of the villa. The door opened as I alighted. An elderly man-servant stood in the doorway bowing. ""M. le Capitaine Hastings?"" he said in French. ""Monsieur le Capitaine is expected. If he will follow me.",0
"It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow. We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed. Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper.",0
"Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!” “You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours. Two coffees.” (This was to the waiter.) “One Turkish, one French.” Tuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed Tommy when he spoke to her. “Be quiet. I’m thinking.” “Shades of Pelmanism!” said Tommy, and relapsed into silence. “There!” said Tuppence at last. “I’ve got a plan. Obviously what we’ve got to do is to find out more about it all.” Tommy applauded. “Don’t jeer.",0
"He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me.",0
"It was right up on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages and villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. “Mrs. Raffini?” I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me. A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. “So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said.",0
"After a word or two to the Inspector, the three of us went to the White Hart and discussed eggs and bacon and Devonshire cider. ""Any elucidations yet?"" asked Ingles, with a smile. ""Yes, the case is clear enough now; but, see you, I shall have a good deal of difficulty in proving it. Whalley was killed by order of the Big Four but not by Grant. A very clever man got Grant the post and deliberately planned to make him the scapegoat an easy matter with Grant's prison record. He gave him a pair of boots, one of two duplicate pairs. The other he kept himself. It was all so simple.",0
""" Ingles was still examining various pieces of Chinese pottery. ""You do not take much interest in this inquiry, monsieur?"" said Poirot. The other gave a slow smile. ""It's not my job, you see. I'm a connoisseur of some things, but not of this. So I just stand back and keep out of the way. I've learnt patience in the East."" The Inspector came bustling in, apologising for having been so long away. He insisted on taking us over most of the ground again, but finally we got away. ""I must appreciate your thousand politenesses, Inspector,"" said Poirot, as we were walking down the village street again. ""There is just one more request I should like to put to you.",0
"The Star of the East was missing! “That settles it,” I breathed. “These were no ordinary thieves. This one stone was all they wanted.” “But how did the fellow get in?” “Through this door.” “But it’s always locked.” I shook my head. “It’s not locked now. See.” I pulled it open as I spoke. As I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It was a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had been torn from a Chinaman’s robe. “In his haste it caught in the door,” I explained. “Come, hurry. He cannot have gone far as yet.” But in vain we hunted and searched.",0
"Tuppence held the glass to her lips. “Drink this.” Mrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to her white cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She tried to sit up then fell back with a groan, her hand to her side. “It’s my heart,” she whispered. “I mustn’t talk.” She lay back with closed eyes. Sir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then withdrew it with a nod. “She’ll do now.” All three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices. One and all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax.",0
"""Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp’s, and I found one or two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.” “Who put it in the chest, I wonder?” “Someone with a good deal of intelligence,” remarked Poirot dryly. “You realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be more intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us of being intelligent at all.” I acquiesced. “There, mon ami, you will be of great assistance to me.” I was pleased with the compliment.",0
"Inglethorp’s door. Sir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down again with a satisfied smile on his face. With the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the proceedings were adjourned until the following day. As we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting counsel.",0
"I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace.",0
"His “hustling” activities were not confined to London, and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully accepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the day’s work. It was quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for Constantinople at a moment’s notice if he fancied that a clue to his cousin’s disappearance was to be found there.",0
"I shall label this car not “Sir Eustace Pedler and Party,” but “Colonel Race and Harem.” Then Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every time we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed higher and higher, she snapped at the engine. “You see the point,” she cried delightedly. “It must be some curve if you can photograph the front part of the train from the back, and with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.” I pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly. “I shall write underneath it: ‘Taken from the train.",0
"The time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough to leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let me go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long moody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by himself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple meal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was sinking. Hairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been able to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my knees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation.",0
"Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.” “Understood what?” “That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.” JULIUS sprang up. “What?” “I thought you were aware of that.” “When did she leave?” “Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been last Wednesday why, surely yes, it was the same evening that you er fell out of my tree.” “That evening? Before, or after?” “Let me see oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived from Mrs. Vandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in charge of her left by the night train.” Julius sank back again into his chair.",0
"And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people.",0
"""Ah, here is M. Poirot!"" said Mr. McNeil. ""M. Poirot, this is Miss er -Monro, who has very kindly called to give us some information."" ""Ah, but that is most kind!"" cried Poirot. He came forward with great empressement, and shook the lady warmly by the hand. ""Mademoiselle blooms like a flower in this dry-as-dust old office,"" he added, careless of the feelings of Mr. McNeil. This outrageous flattery was not without effect. Miss Monro blushed and simpered. ""Oh, go on now, Mr. Poirot!"" she exclaimed. ""I know what you Frenchmen are like.",0
"They’re nearly all Mrs. or Miss.” Tommy nodded. “That complicates matters,” he murmured thoughtfully. Tuppence gave her characteristic “terrier” shake. “Well, we’ve just got to get down to it, that’s all. We’ll start with the London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the females who live in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.” Five minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and a few seconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels, Glendower Road, N.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose name figured first in a list of seven reposing in Tommy’s pocket-book.",0
"Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen.” Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless.",0
"This book will pass into the possession of Scotland Yard, but it will never be publicly exhibited. Sir James’s long association with the law would make it undesirable. But to you, who know the truth, I propose to read certain passages which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great man.” He opened the book, and turned the thin pages. “ It is madness to keep this book. I know that. It is documentary evidence against me. But I have never shrunk from taking risks.",0
"He felt that it would be a pity to come round too soon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt quite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew him now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift. Undoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own wits.",0
"But yes! Here it is! ‘Go it criminals all out! Hercule Poirot and believe me, girls, he’s some Hercules! our own pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’Cause why? ’Cause he’s got la grippe himself’!” I laughed. “Good for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character. And fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest during this time.” “That is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me with any regret.” Our landlady stuck her head in at the door. “There’s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain.",0
"I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud: “. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god.",0
"Poirot threw me a withering glance. “What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!” he exclaimed sarcastically. “Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf a loaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to bake!” I endeavoured to distract his mind. “Anything interesting come by the post?” Poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air. “I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not exist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were banal to the last degree.",0
"As the new-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously precise enunciation, which attracted Tommy’s notice, he asked: “Your number, comrade?” “Fourteen, gov’nor,” replied the other hoarsely. “Correct.” The door shut again. “If that isn’t a Hun, I’m a Dutchman!” said Tommy to himself. “And running the show darned systematically too as they always do. Lucky I didn’t roll in. I’d have given the wrong number, and there would have been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place for me. Hullo, here’s another knock.” This visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last.",0
"“You assert that positively?” “Yes.” “No little disputes, eh?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of opinion now and then.” “Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for Paris, that person, without doubt, would be lying?” I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know everything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question. “We we did have an argument,” he admitted. “Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this phrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’” “I may have done,” muttered the other.",0
"Mrs. Inglethorp said something I do not remember exactly what about causing scandal between husband and wife.” “Ah!” the Coroner leant back satisfied. “That corresponds with what Dorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it was a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where you were?” I caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the little lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied quietly enough: “No. I was very comfortable where I was.",0
"“Confound those detectives! I can’t think what they’re after! They’ve been in every room in the house turning things inside out, and upside down. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all being out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!” “Lot of Paul Prys,” grunted Miss Howard. Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something. Mary Cavendish said nothing. After tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off into the woods together.",0
"I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused.",0
"He had found” Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically. “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?” “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.” “Shooting rooks, eh?” “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.” “Where is this little rook rifle now?” “In the hall, I think.” She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.",0
"A big crowd of solicitors will get busy, and they’ll get some high-brow doctors on the job, and the end of it all will be that they’ll say my brain was unhinged. I shall spend a few months in a quiet sanatorium, my mental health will improve, the doctors will declare me sane again, and all will end happily for little Julius. I guess I can bear a few months’ retirement in order to rid the world of you, but don’t you kid yourself I’ll hang for it!” The Russian believed him. Corrupt himself, he believed implicitly in the power of money.",0
"""Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the body, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I’ve never had a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It’ll last me all my life?” I turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s ghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women were. Now I knew.",0
"""Another point how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had been lost?” “I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case.",0
""" I commented on this last point to Poirot as we walked down the main street of Market Handford. ""Do you think he let a confederate in?"" I asked. ""By the way, I suppose Japp can be trusted to keep an eye on him?"" (The Inspector had passed into the police station on some business or other.) ""The emissaries of the Big Four are pretty spry."" ""Japp is keeping an eye on both of them,"" said Poirot grimly. ""They have been closely shadowed ever since the body was discovered."" ""Well, at any rate we know that Gerald Paynter had nothing to do with it."" ""You always know so much more than I do, Hastings, that it becomes quite fatiguing."" ""You old fox,"" I laughed. ""You never will commit yourself.",0
"But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged. “She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his head towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville.",0
"” The Russian laughed softly, as though amused. “Yes, yes,” he said. “That is true. They must have no inkling that we are using them for our own ends. They are honest men and that is their value to us. It is curious but you cannot make a revolution without honest men. The instinct of the populace is infallible.” He paused, and then repeated, as though the phrase pleased him: “Every revolution has had its honest men. They are soon disposed of afterwards.” There was a sinister note in his voice. The German resumed: “Clymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see to that.",0
"She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far.",0
"“My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up.",0
"As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to note down?” “The letter to you?” “That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning of the case.",0
"""My friend! My friend! But what you must have suffered! And I who knew nothing of all this! But reassure yourself! All is well!"" ""You will find her, you mean? But she is in South America. And by the time we get there long before, she will be dead and God knows how and in what horrible way she will have died."" ""No, no, you do not understand. She is safe and well. She has never been in their hands for one instant."" ""But I got a cable from Bronsen?"" ""No, no, you did not. You may have got a cable from South America signed Bronsen that is a very different matter.",0
"""There must be a secret way out of it somewhere. Come in and let us look for it."" I stepped back across the threshold. In all innocence Poirot prepared to follow me. And then something seemed to snap in my head. I saw only too clearly the part I was playing the part of Judas. ""Back, Poirot!"" I cried. ""Back for your life. It's a trap. Never mind me. Get away at once."" Even as I spoke or rather shouted my warning hands gripped me like a vice. One of the Chinese servants sprang past me to grab Poirot.",0
"He was a man who once loved me.” “In South Africa?” asked the Count negligently. “Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.” “That is your native country, is it not?” She nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. “Well,” he remarked, “you know your own business best, but, if I were you, I should fear the ‘Colonel’ far more than any disillusioned lover. He is a man whom it is particularly easy to underestimate.” She laughed scornfully. “As if I did not know him after all these years!” “I wonder if you do?” he said softly. “I very much wonder if you do.",0
"Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In a minute she resumed: “I don’t know how long it was before I came back to consciousness. I felt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty bed. There was a screen round it, but I could hear two people talking in the room. Mrs. Vandemeyer was one of them. I tried to listen, but at first I couldn’t take much in. When at last I did begin to grasp what was going on I was just terrified! I wonder I didn’t scream right out there and then. “They hadn’t found the papers.",0
"""But, my dear Poirot,"" I persisted, ""are we dealing with a lunatic? I quite follow your reasoning, and admit that you must be right, but to kill a man just to sustain his rôle! Surely there were simpler ways out of the difficulty than that? He could have said that his doctor forbade the strain of a match."" Poirot wrinkled his forehead. ""Certainement, Hastings,"" he said, ""there were other ways, but none so convincing. Besides, you are assuming that to kill a man is a thing to avoid, are you not? Number Four's mind, it does not act that way. I put myself in his place, a thing impossible for you. I picture his thoughts. He enjoys himself as the professor at that match.",0
"He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at this juncture, he suddenly asked: “M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?” “No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there is here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.” “A bunkair?” Poirot turned to me. “That is the irregular hole filled with sand and a bank at one side, is it not?” I concurred. “You do not play the golf, M. Poirot?” inquired Bex.",0
"It is part of the plan of Hercule Poirot! To say more is unnecessary, to any one who has the acute intelligence of my friend Hastings. ""A bas the Big Four! I salute you, my friend, from beyond the grave. ""Ever thine, ""HERCULE POIROT."" I read and re-read this astonishing communication. One thing was evident. This amazing man had so provided for every eventuality that even his own death did not upset the sequence of his plans! Mine was to be the active part his the directing genius. Doubtless I should find full instructions awaiting me beyond the seas. In the meantime my enemies, convinced that I was obeying their warning, would cease to trouble their heads about me.",0
"” Poirot held up his hand with a faint smile. “No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would find it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to replace it by now.” “But do you think ” “I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his favour. That is all.” John looked perplexed. “Do not worry,” said Poirot smoothly. “I assure you that you need not let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some breakfast.” Everyone was assembled in the dining-room.",0
"She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will.",0
"“This time it is an idea gigantic! Stupendous! And you you, my friend, have given it to me!” Suddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks, and before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room. Mary Cavendish entered at that moment. “What is the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying out: ‘A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!’ And, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.” I hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the street, hatless, and gesticulating as he went.",0
"No one came. They rang again and again but there was no sign of life. Then they walked completely round the house. Everywhere silence, and shuttered windows. If they could believe the evidence of their eyes the place was empty. “Nothing doing,” said Julius. They retraced their steps slowly to the gate. “There must be a village handy,” continued the young American. “We’d better make inquiries there. They’ll know something about the place, and whether there’s been anyone there lately.” “Yes, that’s not a bad idea.” Proceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet.",0
"It’s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There’s to be money in it ” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.",0
"""I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The ‘Colonel’ is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.” “I am not afraid of him,” she laughed. “There is only one man I have ever feared and he is dead.” The man looked at her curiously. “Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,” he remarked lightly. “What do you mean?” cried the dancer sharply. The Count looked slightly surprised. “I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,” he explained. “A foolish joke.” She gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war.",0
"“How unfortunate for you,” she said coldly. “You had better go to bed.” “Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma’am. Cook will ” “Cook is out,” said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable tone. “I sent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.” Suddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs. Vandemeyer’s voice that she did not like at all. Also, the other woman was slowly edging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at bay. “I don’t want ” Then, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and Mrs.",0
"Tuppence received the remark with great disfavour. “How horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn’t count.” “Sorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in the dark, and that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes. Ha ha!” “Ha ha!” echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose. South Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just off Park Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor. Tommy had by this time the glibness born of practice.",0
"""Mon ami, some one has tampered with it. It had still three days to run. It is an eight-day clock, you comprehend?"" ""But what should they want to do that for? Some idea of a false scent by making the crime appear to have taken place at four o'clock?"" ""No, no; rearrange your ideas, mon ami. Exercise your little gray cells. You are Mayerling. You hear something, perhaps and you know well enough that your doom is sealed. You have just time to leave a sign. Four o'clock, Hastings. Number Four, the destroyer. Ah! an idea!"" He rushed into the other room and seized the telephone. He asked for Hanwell.",0
"Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several questions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English. Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.",0
"A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.” I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied. “So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly.",0
"""Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that.",0
"You see, you know rather an inconvenient amount. That’s a rough outline. I admit I was caught napping; but somebody else wasn’t.” “Tommy,” said Tuppence softly. “Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him he was too sharp for them. All the same, I’m not too easy in my mind about him.” “Why?” “Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,” said Sir James dryly. “And it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr. Brown” Tuppence paled a little. “What can we do?” “Nothing until we’ve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has still got the upper hand, there’s nothing to fear.",0
"Having parted with mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the interview had taken place in a house in St. John’s Wood) and across Hyde Park to St. George’s Hospital. There I entered Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road. Once on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring mind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really were points and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased to find I was right.",0
"The neatness of his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a detective, his flair had been extraordinary, and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day. He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow Belgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date.",0
"""Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?” I told her something about Papa’s life work. “So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t a mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls?” “I may,” I said cautiously. “I’ve got other plans as well.” “What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning. Didn’t you sleep well? I can’t keep awake on board a boat. Ten hours’ sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!” She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten.",0
"She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost it’s what she must have thought me at first all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.",0
"I loved it loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there always always. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home.",0
"Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn. “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate very delicate.” “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.” He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. “My dear Pedler! The common post!” It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’ Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents.",0
"“Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little salon.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say ” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us.",0
"The following is a facsimile: STYLES COURT ESSEX hand written note: July 17th My dear Evelyn Can we not bury the hachet? I have found it hard to forgive the things you said against my dear husband but I am an old woman & very fond of you Yours affectionately, Emily Inglethorpe It was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively. “I fear it does not help us much,” said the Coroner, with a sigh. “There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.” “Plain as a pikestaff to me,” said Miss Howard shortly.",0
My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship.,0
"“What was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?” “We’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large transaction having been just carried through. There was also a small fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim’s jewels were kept in the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem.” “Altogether a good haul,” said Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"“Assuring you once more that the matter is urgent, “Yours faithfully “P. T. RENAULD.” Below the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “For God’s sake, come!” I handed the letter back with quickened pulses. “At last!” I said. “Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.” “Yes, indeed,” said Poirot meditatively. “You will go of course,” I continued. Poirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his mind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave. “See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty of time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion.",0
"""Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago.",0
With that and her social position she would have had little difficulty in imposing her point of view in preference to yours. Your sensational accusations against her would not easily have found credence.” “That’s what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at Bournemouth. I couldn’t make up my mind at first whether it was a sham affair or genuine. A hospital nurse had charge of me. I was a special patient. She seemed so nice and normal that at last I determined to confide in her. A merciful providence just saved me in time from falling into the trap.,0
"“How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered. “But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.",0
"He is represented by an 'S' with two lines through it the sign for a dollar; also by two stripes and a star. It may be conjectured, therefore, that he is an American subject, and that he represents the power of wealth. There seems no doubt that Number Three is a woman, and her nationality French. It is possible that she may be one of the sirens of the demi-monde but nothing is known definitely. Number Four "" His voice faltered and broke. Poirot leant forward. ""Yes,"" he prompted eagerly. ""Number Four?"" His eyes were fastened on the man's face.",0
"""I feel heated,” said Tommy. Julius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more. However, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached Holyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they alighted at their destination. After consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were fairly well agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi without more ado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur Bay. They instructed the man to go slowly, and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path.",0
"But I must take the other tray. We need the things on it.” “Well, hurry up,” growled Conrad. Without looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and picked up the tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light. “Curse you” Conrad had come to the door “why did you do that?” “I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight it, Monsieur Conrad?” “No, come on out of it.” “Le beau petit monsieur,” cried Annette, pausing by the bed in the darkness.",0
"“Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does ” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother. The magistrate understood. “As yet no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?” “I have no idea whatsoever.” M. Hautet sighed. “A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis.",0
"” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did not confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak, don’t we?” I admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language.",0
"“For a long time they were a stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact: that she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not debar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather over-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion. There was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he came to Styles.",0
"After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh. Their employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh’s orders. They remembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs, they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised.",0
"""Give it to me.” He handed it to her. “I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing yourself down behind the ladder, so that they will not see you?” Tommy nodded. “There’s a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand behind it. Take the end of this string in your hand. When I’ve let the others out pull! ” Before he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted lightly down the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry: “Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu’est-ce qu’il y a?” The German turned on her with an oath. “Get out of this.",0
"""Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?” “No, not one.” “Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to tetanus?” “Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.” “Then we have four deaths all totally dissimilar, one heart failure, one blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.",0
"“If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain.",0
"Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared the woman. “Cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.” Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms. “Two?” said Poirot sharply. “Yes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil one and sure enough, so he did do.",0
"He was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of Sole à la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius entering the room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded in attracting the other’s attention. At the sight of Tommy, Julius’s eyes seemed as though they would pop out of his head. He strode across, and pump-handled Tommy’s hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour. “Holy snakes!” he ejaculated. “Is it really you?” “Of course it is. Why shouldn’t it be?” “Why shouldn’t it be? Say, man, don’t you know you’ve been given up for dead? I guess we’d have had a solemn requiem for you in another few days.” “Who thought I was dead?” demanded Tommy.",0
"“I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said, in a low voice. “It’s been in the family so long.” She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her shoulders. “I must go and dress. I suppose I had better display ‘the goods.’” She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. “It’s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George has always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never been done.” She left the room. Half an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady.",0
"He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.” “No question of his having been shot, eh?” “My dear sir!” “I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!” “You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr.",0
"I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married even to Clarence!” I disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all.",0
"“My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning. The girl with the anxious eyes! Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld’s behalf, for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.” “By the way,” I exclaimed, “how is Jack Renauld?” “Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite.",0
"I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.” “Beira,” I said meditatively. “Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to me.” We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at each other. “Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut. I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours.",0
"” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure.",0
"“You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett” “And you?” That was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the Kilmorden, or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat.",0
"Renauld left the house to keep an appointment possibly with the murderer leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat.",0
"“If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by mistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. Come on, let’s have tea. We’ve got all sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. No, Lawrence that’s the poison cupboard. The big cupboard that’s right.” We had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards. We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door. The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern and forbidding expression. “Come in,” said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.",0
"Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot.",0
"What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.",0
"Took a car across the town mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I’ll take Jane there for a spell when I find her and then paid it off and struck out along those pine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was there too, you understand. We walked, maybe, for half an hour. There’s a lot of villas all the way along, but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out, and in the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it was, with a lot of piny grounds around it. “It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the house was dark as pitch.",0
"Then he went on towards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight ‘chink’ which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short search, discovered the ring! That is Kellett’s story. It’s only fair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word of a man like Kellett can’t be relied upon in the slightest. It’s within the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him.” Poirot shook his head. “Very improbable, mon ami. He had no means of disposing of the body. It would have been found by now.",0
"I knew the answer, at least I knew what Poirot's answer would be, and instead I tried without success to elicit some information as to what steps he was taking to track down the enemy. As usual he had kept me completely in the dark as to his movements, but I gathered that he was in touch with secret service agents in India, China, and Russia, and, from his occasional bursts of self-glorification, that he was at least progressing in his favourite game of gauging his enemy's mind. He had abandoned his private practice almost entirely, and I know that at this time he refused some remarkably handsome fees.",0
"They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of about forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four. Count Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man paused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted that, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed immediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on.",0
"” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem.",0
"So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it.",0
"“I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?” I studied the proofs attentively. “All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man’s finger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady’s; they are much smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3” I paused for some time “there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here, very distinctly, are No. 1’s.” “Overlapping the others?” “Yes.” “You recognize them beyond fail?” “Oh, yes; they are identical.” Poirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up again.",0
"""What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.",0
"She was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant. In her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but he soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair. “Pray be seated, mademoiselle.” “Thank you, sir.” “You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?” “Ten years, sir.” “That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached to her, were you not?” “She was a very good mistress to me, sir.” “Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to you with Mr.",0
"""Six months already,"" I mused, ""and where are we? You know, Poirot, I can't help thinking that we ought to well, to do something."" ""Always so energetic, Hastings! And what precisely would you have me do?"" This was somewhat of a poser, but I was not going to withdraw from my position. ""We ought to take the offensive,"" I urged. ""What have we done all this time?"" ""More than you think, my friend. After all, we have established the identity of Number Two and Number Three, and we have learnt more than a little about the ways and methods of Number Four."" I brightened up a little.",0
"I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method” “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted.",0
"“When did you first suspect John Cavendish?” I asked, after a minute or two. “Did you not suspect him at all?” “No, indeed.” “Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest?” “No.” “Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife and you remember, he strenuously denied it at the inquest it must be either Lawrence or John.",0
"‘I’ve left you nothing in my will,’ says he, ‘but each year I live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg when I’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.” Poirot reflected. “After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do you know?” “Went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.” That did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He held out the key of the desk. “Is that your master’s writing?” I may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed before Baker replied: “Yes, sir, it is.",0
"“That, of course, I cannot say, but shall I tell you my own private opinion, Hastings?” “Yes.” “Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has cared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!” “Do you really think so?” I could not disguise my pleasure. “I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.” “Yes?” “Because she cares for someone else, mon ami.” “Oh!” What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread over me.",0
"” Poirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady Yardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game. “Vous êtes bonne mère,” said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse. Lady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair. “I adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice. “And they you with reason!” Poirot bowed again. A dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms.",0
"There is food for thought in this, mon ami!” “It’s very confusing,” I agreed. “Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,” continued Poirot. “That’s another who is not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?” “I don’t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she should be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.” Poirot nodded reflectively. “Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more of that ‘private conversation’ than she was willing to admit.” “And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop!” “Exactly.",0
"He has only just recovered.” “Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw ruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.” Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past.",0
"They passed to Europe” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood.",0
"Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.” “Thank you,” I said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “Les Anglais!” he murmured. “No method absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. “Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told me, did you not?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “True, I forgot.” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot.",0
"For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me.",0
"“Then, évidemment, we must find out just how we stand. When did Mr. Schneider’s death take place?” “Three days ago.” “You are sure it was tetanus?” “Dead sure.” “It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for instance?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a clear case of tetanus.” “Did you not inject anti-serum?” “Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing that could be done was tried.” “Had you the anti-serum with you?” “No. We procured it from Cairo.",0
"Beresford, that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here this evening. The last I heard of you was that your friends were in grave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had been heard of you for some days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into difficulties.” “I had, sir!” Tommy grinned reminiscently. “I was never in a tighter place in my life.” Helped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated account of his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he brought the tale to a close. “You got yourself out of a tight place very well,” he said gravely. “I congratulate you.",0
"We saw no more of the man from the asylum, and the inquest, at which I gave evidence, but which Poirot did not even attend, aroused no public interest. As, in view of his intended trip to South America, Poirot had wound up his affairs before my arrival, he had at this time no cases on hand, but although he spent most of his time in the flat I could get little out of him. He remained buried in an arm-chair, and discouraged my attempts at conversation. And then one morning, about a week after the murder, he asked me if I would care to accompany him on a visit he wished to make.",0
"My words startled her still more. “To South Africa? My dear Anne. We would have to look into anything of that kind very carefully.” That was the last thing I wanted. I explained that I had already taken my passage, and that upon arrival I proposed to take up the duties of a parlourmaid. It was the only thing I could think of on the spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to taking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at getting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further query.",0
"""Read this, mon ami."" I turned first to the signature, ""Abe Ryland,"" and recalled Poirot's words: ""the richest man in the world."" Mr. Ryland's letter was curt and incisive. He expressed himself as profoundly dissatisfied with the reasons Poirot had given for withdrawing from the South American proposition at the last moment. ""This gives one furiously to think, does it not?"" said Poirot. ""I suppose it's only natural he should be a bit ratty."" ""No, no, you comprehend not. Remember the words of Mayerling, the man who took refuge here only to die by the hands of his enemies.",0
"” We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us. “Japp!” I ejaculated. The Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion. “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.” “My wife” “I’ve seen your good lady, sir and the housekeeper. I won’t keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.” “I know nothing as yet as to what” “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly.",0
"Caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it again, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little dreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the incriminating document. “But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs.",0
"He emerged into the busy daylight feeling himself once more, and able to make plans. First of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing since midday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and ordered eggs and bacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a morning paper propped up in front of him. Suddenly he stiffened. There was a long article on Kramenin, who was described as the “man behind Bolshevism” in Russia, and who had just arrived in London some thought as an unofficial envoy. His career was sketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he, and not the figurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian Revolution.",0
"""In spite of his statement that he was not feeling ill, the doctor noted that the shock of his suspicions had evidently affected him, and that his heart was feeling it. Accordingly he administered an injection not of a narcotic, but of strychnine. ""That, I think, completes the case except for the crux of the whole thing the fact that the uneaten curry, duly analysed, was found to contain enough powdered opium to have killed two men!"" I paused. ""And your conclusions, Hastings?"" asked Poirot quietly. ""It's difficult to say.",0
"Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I thought I should go mad.” “Never mind. It’s all over.” “Is it?” The train was moving now, speeding through the night at a gradually increasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up. “What was that? I thought I saw a face looking in through the window.” “No, there’s nothing. See.” Tuppence went to the window, and lifting the strap let the pane down. “You’re sure?” “Quite sure.” The other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary: “I guess I’m acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can’t help it.",0
"I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner. He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets.",0
"She therefore opened the desk, and in searching for the stamps she came across something else that slip of paper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant for Mrs. Inglethorp’s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously was a written proof of her own husband’s infidelity. She demanded it from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing to do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs.",0
"It is true that we were on the terrace of the hotel, with people all round us, but nevertheless I was not satisfied. I sensed the presence of danger. Meanwhile Number Four chatted away in a perfectly natural manner. It seemed impossible to believe that he was anything but a bona fide tourist. He described excursions and motor trips, and posed as quite an authority on the neighbourhood. He took a pipe from his pocket and began to light it. Poirot drew out his case of tiny cigarettes. As he placed one between his lips, the stranger leant forward with a match. ""Let me give you a light.",0
"TUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters of the archdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They were also experts in training a “raw girl,” the inevitable result being that the raw girl, once trained, departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacon’s meagre purse allowed. Tuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient. Mrs. Vandemeyer’s cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly terror of her mistress. The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some hold over her.",0
"She repeats the letter to you, together with her tale of Mr. Ryland's wrath, you write it down, you puzzle your brains the cipher is nicely arranged, difficult, but not too difficult you solve it, and you send for me."" ""But what they do not know is that I am waiting for just this very thing to happen. I go post haste to Japp and arrange things. And so, as you see, all is triumph!"" I was not particularly pleased with Poirot, and I told him so. We went back to London on a milk train in the early hours of the morning, and a most uncomfortable journey it was.",0
"Lawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer to Mr. Philips’ questions, he denied having ordered anything from Parkson’s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in Wales. Instantly, Sir Ernest’s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward. “You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson’s on June 29th?” “I do.” “Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will inherit Styles Court?” The brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence’s pale face. The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily. Heavywether cared nothing for his client’s anger.",0
"Renauld. It has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young hand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology, is almost certain to fail.” “You’re marvellous, Poirot,” I said, with admiration. “Absolutely marvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!” I think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost embarrassed. “Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound?” His term for Giraud never failed to make me smile. “Rather.",0
"Inglethorp who had been in the boudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the face of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to give evidence against her husband. After various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked: “In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr. Lawrence Cavendish from Parkson’s?” Dorcas shook her head. “I don’t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr.",0
"After him came the others. Tommy stopped Conrad’s rush with a straight blow with his fist. It caught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log. The second man tripped over his body and fell. From higher up the staircase there was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy’s ear. He realized that it would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as possible. As regards Annette he could do nothing. He had got even with Conrad, which was one satisfaction. The blow had been a good one. He leapt for the door, slamming it behind him.",0
"""I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.” “Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, n’est-ce pas? What it is to be young! O jeunesse, jeunesse!” And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.",0
"Each man had his own pet theory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring in front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an amusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot’s behaviour moved me to intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat, clutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily. “Mon Dieu!” he murmured. “This is terrible!” “Have courage, Poirot,” I cried. “You will succeed. You will find him. I am sure of it.” “Ah, mon ami, you mistake my emotion.",0
"“You permit, madame?” He took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her with a little bow. “A magnificent stone without a flaw. Ah, cent tonnerres! and you carry it about with you, comme ça!” “No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it’s locked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit. We’re staying at the Magnificent, you know. I just brought it along to-day for you to see.” “And you will leave it with me, n’est-ce pas? You will be advised by Papa Poirot?” “Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot.",0
"In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir James Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday’s paper dealt appreciatively with the dead man’s career. The exact manner of his sudden death was never made public. Tommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had been a one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization fell to pieces. Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which compromised them hopelessly.",0
"I had gone some way down the garden when I chanced to look over my shoulder. Mr. Ryland was just stepping out from his study window into the garden. He was starting to keep the appointment. I redoubled my pace, so as to get a clear start. I arrived at the quarry somewhat out of breath. There seemed no one about, and I crawled into a thick tangle of bushes and awaited developments. Ten minutes later, just on the stroke of eleven, Ryland stalked up, his hat over his eyes and the inevitable cigar in his mouth. He gave a quick look round, and then plunged into the hollows of the quarry below.",0
"You never saw such a woman! Forty, if she’s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular slab-faced woman.” “Won’t she hold your hand?” “I devoutly hope not!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “That would be the last straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan’t give you the skin after the base way you’ve deserted me.” He squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for me in the hall. She was to come down to see me off. “Let’s start at once,” I said hastily, and motioned to the man to get a taxi.",0
"Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a tangible reality. We had read of such things now we ourselves were actors in the drama.",0
"“Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well er I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence.",0
"What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute.",0
"I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always something! And I mean to find it.” But Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short discoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched it delicately with his finger. “And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question. Giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor cared.",0
"Are you going up now, miss? Step inside the lift. No. 20 did you say?” And he winked. Tuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside. As she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert’s eyes slowly descending beneath the level of the floor. A smart young woman opened the door. “I’ve come about the place,” said Tuppence. “It’s a rotten place,” said the young woman without hesitation. “Regular old cat always interfering. Accused me of tampering with her letters. Me! The flap was half undone anyway. There’s never anything in the waste-paper basket she burns everything.",0
"I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful. I understand now ” “What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa Poirot, eh? But you would not trust me.” “I see everything now,” said Lawrence. “The drugged cocoa, taken on top of the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.” “Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a little difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.” “What?” The cry of surprise was universal. “No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.",0
"That’s what makes it so wonderful.” “Wonderful is the word! It’s a blinking miracle. But there must be a catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?” “No premium!” “No prem oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned Parker. “But we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued Mrs. Robinson. “Ah!” Parker brisked up. “I knew there was a catch!” “For fifty pounds. And it’s beautifully furnished!” “I give it up,” said Parker. “The present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy.” Mrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker appeared between her dainty brows.",0
"I hoped devoutly that we should never fall into her power again. Three minutes later we were outside the villa, and hurriedly traversing the garden. The road outside was deserted, and we were soon clear of the neighbourhood. Then Poirot broke out. ""I deserve all that that woman said to me. I am a triple imbecile, a miserable animal, thirty-six times an idiot. I was proud of myself for not falling into their trap. And it was not even meant as a trap except exactly in the way in which I fell into it. They knew I would see through it they counted on my seeing through it.",0
"“I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.” I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest. “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.” “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?” “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science.",0
"Whether Luigi Valdarno was the thief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past Luigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the antecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about the time of Valdarno’s death.",0
"“TOMMY, old thing!” “Tuppence, old bean!” The two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective “old” was misleading. Their united ages would certainly not have totalled forty-five. “Not seen you for simply centuries,” continued the young man. “Where are you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We’re getting a bit unpopular here blocking the gangway as it were. Let’s get out of it.” The girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards Piccadilly.",0
"“My friends, if I were hiding from the police, do you know where I should hide? In a prison!” “What?” “You are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison, so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there!” “What do you mean?” “You tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman. Nevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and confronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him! In spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close.",0
"Suzanne left her face half anointed and pressed for details. I gave them to her. “It all gets more and more mysterious,” she cried. “I thought I was going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that you would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but now I’m not so sure. I hope Pagett won’t push me off the train some dark night.” “I think you’re still above suspicion, Suzanne. But, if the worst happens, I’ll wire to Clarence.” “That reminds me give me a cable form. Let me see now, what shall I say.",0
"Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder ” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M.",0
"In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me I know what happens in a case of that kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters of law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms.",0
"Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked men, the ‘secret,’ the papers!” Poirot smiled a little. “Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably. But reflect now on something very curious.",0
"So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, but this morning has been dull as dull.” “You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence. Remember that if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it’s a wonder that he has not ere now done us to death. That’s a good sentence, quite a literary flavour about it.” “You’re really more conceited than I am with less excuse! Ahem! But it certainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked vengeance upon us. (You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way unscathed.” “Perhaps he doesn’t think us worth bothering about,” suggested the young man simply.",0
"“We will give you short shrift. Kill him! Kill him!” There was a roar of applause. “You hear?” said the German, his eyes on Tommy. “What have you to say to that?” “Say?” Tommy shrugged his shoulders. “Pack of fools. Let them ask themselves a few questions. How did I get into this place? Remember what dear old Conrad said with your own password, wasn’t it? How did I get hold of that? You don’t suppose I came up those steps haphazard and said the first thing that came into my head?” Tommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech.",0
"He can assume any part he pleases."" I thought back over past adventures, the lunatic asylum keeper, the butcher's young man, the suave doctor, all the same man, and all totally unlike each other. ""It's amazing,"" I said at last. ""Everything fits in. Savaronoff had an inkling of the plot, and that's why he was so averse to playing the match."" Poirot looked at me without speaking. Then he turned abruptly away, and began pacing up and down. ""Have you a book on chess by any chance, mon ami?"" he asked suddenly. ""I believe I have somewhere.",0
"Bauerstein.” “Any more faults to find with the evidence?” I inquired satirically. “Mon ami,” replied Poirot gravely, “when you find that people are not telling you the truth look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the inquest to-day only one at most, two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge.” “Oh, come now, Poirot! I won’t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But there’s John and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?” “Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both !” His words gave me an unpleasant shock.",0
"He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly. I, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm. “I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late if you go yourself.” Poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two. “Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram.” At that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the Flying Corps. “This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France.",0
"""But it could not deceive M. Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “You mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable proof. Madame Renauld’s story was false a fabrication from beginning to end. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband yet she lied to shield his murderer. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for herself, usually for the man she loves, always for her children. That is the last the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.” Giraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily. “That is my case,” said Giraud. “What have you to say to it?” “Only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.",0
"“Think we’re as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round? Not ‘alf! We’ve ordered the carriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin’, but in the meantime we’re not taking any chances, see!” “Nothing,” said Tommy, “could be plainer than your words unless it was your face.” “Stow it,” said Number 14. “With pleasure,” replied Tommy. “You’re making a sad mistake but yours will be the loss.” “You don’t kid us that way again,” said Number 14. “Talking as though you were still at the blooming Ritz, aren’t you?” Tommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown had discovered his identity.",0
"The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable.",0
"In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me.",0
"Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.",0
"Inglethorp’s own doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in. In a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be passing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the house as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins. With a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed. “Ve ry sad. Ve ry sad,” murmured Dr. Wilkins. “Poor dear lady. Always did far too much far too much against my advice. I warned her. Her heart was far from strong. ‘Take it easy,’ I said to her, ‘Take it easy’. But no her zeal for good works was too great.",0
"I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain.",0
"“Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the end his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he scrawled those four desperate words.” But my friend shook his head energetically. “You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?” “Well?” I said puzzled. “Mon Dieu, mon ami, but use your little grey cells! Is it not obvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it carefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last words, and blotted the sheet.",0
"But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act but I could not rest easy in my mind.",0
"What becomes of your theories, then?” “They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire. Also,” he added placidly, “I should not allow it!” “You would not allow it?” “No.” I looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and amusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded gently. “Oh, yes, mon ami, I would do what I say.",0
"""They say,” I said slowly, “that you are really connected with the Government that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road.",0
"On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part.",0
"It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough. Any message that comes genuinely from me will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.",0
"I have locked them and, in my opinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.” The doctors then departed. I had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment had now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John, I knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing optimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the other hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I felt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead.",0
"“I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening.",0
"""Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying.",0
"Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well.",0
"You see, under the terms of their father’s will, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother’s death, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep up Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law that will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?” Mr. Wells bowed his head. “As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null and void.” “Hein!” said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: “Was Mrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?” “I do not know.",0
"Vandemeyer’s eyes. She leaned back in her chair. “Bah!” she said. “You haven’t got it.” “No,” admitted Tuppence, “I haven’t but I know some one who has.” “Who?” “A friend of mine.” “Must be a millionaire,” remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly. “As a matter of fact he is. He’s an American. He’ll pay you that without a murmur. You can take it from me that it’s a perfectly genuine proposition.” Mrs. Vandemeyer sat up again. “I’m inclined to believe you,” she said slowly. There was silence between them for some time, then Mrs. Vandemeyer looked up.",0
"Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour slightly to my annoyance. I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon: “It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a garde-malad.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had occurred.",0
"“You think so? Eh bien, I agree with you,” said Poirot. He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “Mon Dieu! But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, mon ami. At last I am on the right track. I am still in the dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.",0
"Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman.",0
"Read every fourth word in the letter, and an entirely different message appeared. ""Essential should see you quarry seventeen eleven four."" The solution of the figures was easy. Seventeen stood for the seventeenth of October which was to-morrow, eleven was the time, and four was the signature either referring to the mysterious Number Four himself or else it was the ""trade-mark"" so to speak, of the Big Four. The quarry was also intelligible. There was a big disused quarry on the estate about half a mile from the house a lonely spot, ideal for a secret meeting.",0
"He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be rolling. You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence my husband, you know. It’s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.",0
""" About twenty minutes later the telephone bell rang. I answered it. A curt voice spoke into the phone. ""Is that Mr. Poirot? St. James Hospital speaking. A young woman was brought in ten minutes ago. Street accident. Miss Flossie Monro. She is asking very urgently for Mr. Poirot. But he must come at once. She can't possibly last long."" I repeated the words to Poirot. His face went white. ""Quick, Hastings. We must go like the wind."" A taxi took us to the hospital in less than ten minutes. We asked for Miss Monro, and were taken immediately to the accident ward. But a white-capped sister met us in the doorway. Poirot read the news in her face. ""It is over, eh?"" ""She died six minutes ago.",0
"The House of Commons is bad enough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight restriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly before leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman with a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle in Alice in Wonderland. He dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy fashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further efforts by ejaculating something that sounded like “Platt Skeet,” uttered fortissimo and in marked contrast to the rest of his delivery.",0
"The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the crime passionnel is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.” “But what about the crime passionnel? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head.",0
"“Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables” “Oh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed. “Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters and er guides.” “Exactly,” I hastened to reply.",0
"le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions.",0
"""I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves that sort of thing.” “If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.” “I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.” “Ah, that reminds me what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a secretary?” And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly.",0
"As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency.” “By the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French window of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a good way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot fix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as the gardeners cease work at that time.” “And Mr.",0
"Then he raised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away. “He’s a dear little man,” said Cynthia. “I’d no idea you knew him.” “You’ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,” I replied. And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot. We arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs. Inglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset. “Oh, it’s you,” she said. “Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?” asked Cynthia. “Certainly not,” said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply.",0
"It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted wire through the handle. Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door opposite leading into Cynthia’s room. That door was also bolted, as I had stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention.",0
"“It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.",0
"I could not see into the passage from where I sat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek as she turned to him. “You saw him there in the passage?” she cried. He was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his head. “I saw him my husband you must have seen him too?” “Madame, I saw nothing. You are not well unstrung” “I am perfectly well, IOh, God!” Suddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out. Out of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs. Maltravers moaning. And then I saw! The man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us, gleaming with a faint ghostly light.",0
"I must admit, however, that I was half asleep when Mrs. Pearson's knock at the door aroused me. ""A telegram for you, captain."" I tore the orange envelope open without much interest. Then I sat as though turned to stone. It was a cable from Bronsen, my manager out at the South American ranch, and it ran as follows: ""Mrs. Hastings disappeared yesterday, feared been kidnapped by some gang calling itself big four cable instructions have notified police but no clue as yet."" BRONSEN. I waved Mrs. Pearson out of the room, and sat as though stunned, reading the words over and over again.",0
"“How ridiculous! He’s going out of the gate. Isn’t he coming back to-day?” “I don’t know. I’ve given up trying to guess what he’ll do next.” “Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?” “I honestly don’t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method in his madness.” “I see.” In spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She seemed grave, almost sad. It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on the subject of Cynthia.",0
"“What the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly. “I want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.” “There’s no doctor here.” The man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in adroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated Frenchman. “What you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You must come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.” “My dear sir” The door was opened again, the man, clad in a dressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with an uneasy glance round. “I will call the police.” Poirot prepared to descend the steps. “No, don’t do that for Heaven’s sake!” The man dashed after him.",0
"Of course Giraud is all wrong wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not because of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all that I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts not by my leading you by the hand.",0
"I believe she’s the cousin of the hall porter, or something of the kind. And nobody even dreams that I have any connection with our mutual friend, Mr. Brown.” “For heaven’s sake, be careful, Rita. That door isn’t shut.” “Well, shut it then,” laughed the woman. Tuppence removed herself speedily. She dared not absent herself longer from the back premises, but she cleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired in hospital. Then she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door. The cook, more leisurely, was still busy in the kitchen and, if she missed the other, would only suppose her to be turning down the beds.",0
"” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds. All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client. Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking, with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child. Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once. “You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice.",0
"Nature rebelled. Na ture re belled.” Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He still kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke. “The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry you were not here in time to witness them. They were quite tetanic in character.” “Ah!” said Dr. Wilkins wisely. “I should like to speak to you in private,” said Dr. Bauerstein. He turned to John. “You do not object?” “Certainly not.” We all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone, and I heard the key turned in the lock behind us. We went slowly down the stairs.",0
"After relating the earlier events, he proceeded: “Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself searched the prisoner’s room, during his temporary absence from the house. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we found: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by Mr. Inglethorp” these were exhibited “secondly, this phial.” The phial was that already recognized by the chemist’s assistant, a tiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white crystalline powder, and labelled: “Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.",0
"I followed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning against the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently. “No, no leave me. I’d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a minute or two. Go down to the others.” I obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I joined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of us all when I at last broke it by saying: “Where is Mr. Inglethorp?” John shook his head. “He’s not in the house.” Our eyes met. Where was Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange and inexplicable.",0
"I distinctly heard the rustle of a dress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was being watched! “I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer brought me some supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I guess she’d been told to win my confidence. Presently she produced the oilskin packet, and asked me if I recognized it, watching me like a lynx all the time. “I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I shook my head.",0
"I saw the face for the first time the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face. “Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any chance?” As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.",0
"Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends arriving.” A mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker. “How did you know this address?” I asked as I followed Poirot out into the hall. “Oh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson followed when she left the other flat.” “A la bonne heure, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last. Now for a little surprise for Japp.” Softly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat’s head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing “Miaow.” The Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another man, jumped in spite of himself. “Oh, it’s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!” he exclaimed, as Poirot’s head followed that of the cat.",0
"I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this time!) I murmured: “Kilmorden Castle?” “On the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?” “How much is it?” “First class, eighty-seven pounds” I interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly the amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket. “First class,” I said. I was now definitely committed to the adventure.  (Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.) It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace. I am a man who likes a quiet life.",0
"Miss Cowley told him. “And the curious part of it is,” she ended, “that I really did invent the name of Jane Finn! I didn’t want to give my own because of poor father in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.” “Perhaps that’s so,” said Tommy slowly. “But you didn’t invent it.” “What?” “No. I told it to you. Don’t you remember, I said yesterday I’d overheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? That’s what brought the name into your mind so pat.” “So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary ” Tuppence tailed off into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself.",0
"""What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question.",0
"“Don’t you think she’s the most lovely creature you’ve ever seen?” “Oh, I dare say.” “But I suppose you prefer sterling worth,” said Tuppence demurely. “I oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!” “I like your uncle, Tommy,” said Tuppence, hastily creating a diversion. “By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr. Carter’s offer of a Government job, or accept Julius’s invitation and take a richly remunerated post in America on his ranch?” “I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it’s awfully good of Hersheimmer.",0
"You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured.",0
"“All this is very well in its way, but we must get to business. Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all.",0
"The windows were fastened securely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having intervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is likely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained undetected until Monday.” “Précisément,” said Poirot dryly. “Well, is he arrested, ce pauvre M. Lowen?” Japp grinned. “Not yet. But he’s under pretty close supervision.” Poirot nodded.",0
"""What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.",0
"“And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes” he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?” Sarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us.",0
"We closed the door and Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The boat was just about to run alongside it. “Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice. Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.",0
"""I think, Captain Hastings, that you will write that letter. See, I have a cable form here. The message I shall write on it depends on you, and means life or death for your wife."" The sweat broke out on my brow. My tormentor continued, smiling amiably, and speaking with perfect sangfroid: ""There, captain, the pen is ready to your hand. You have only to write. If not "" ""If not?"" I echoed. ""If not, that lady that you love dies and dies slowly. My master, Li Chang Yen, amuses himself in his spare hours by devising new and ingenious methods of tortures "" ""My God!"" I cried.",0
"I remember Claudie, now I come to think of it, always fiddling with his bread at table. He'd get a little piece between his fingers and then dab it round to pick up crumbs. I've seen him do it a hundred times. Why, I'd know him anywhere by that one trick of his."" ""Is not that just what I say? The marvellous observation of a woman. And did you ever speak to him about this little habit of his, mademoiselle?"" ""No, I didn't, Mr. Poirot. You know what men are! They don't like you to notice things especially if it should seem you were telling them off about it.",0
"He was a small thin man, very brown of face, with light blue eyes and a small dark beard. “Just come from abroad,” I deduced. “That’s why his overcoat smells so. He’s come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn’t have a beard. Perhaps a tea-planter.” At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by fear almost panic.",0
"The war entered on another phase, the diplomatic aspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never redrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The disappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost in oblivion.” Mr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently: “But why has it all cropped up again? The war’s over.” A hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter’s manner. “Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all, and that they might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly significance.” Tuppence stared. Mr.",0
"For my own part, I felt a deep pity as I looked down upon the motionless form and convulsed face of the hapless young American who had come by his death in such a strange way. Poirot examined the body attentively. There was no mark on it anywhere, except a small scar on the left hand. ""And the doctor says that's a burn, not a cut,"" explained Japp. Poirot's attention shifted to the contents of the dead man's pockets which a constable spread out for our inspection.",0
"” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills.",0
"""What little idea?” “Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend’s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a sentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?” “Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it nonsense?” “Not at all.",0
"Us had signed one” “What time of day was that?” Baker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker. “Why, to be sure, I’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven. Don’t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen.” “And afterwards?” “’Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. ‘I’ve made a mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. I’ll trouble you to sign again,’ and us did. And afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each.",0
"So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear. We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M.",0
"Perhaps you would like to come with me?” We acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead and I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot: “There will be an inquest then?” Poirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that my curiosity was aroused. “What is it? You are not attending to what I say.” “It is true, my friend. I am much worried.” “Why?” “Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.” “What? You cannot be serious?” “But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not understand. My instinct was right.” “What instinct?” “The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.",0
"The principal finds had been removed to Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting. The enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that I detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we entered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before joining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in Arabic. Poirot stopped.",0
"” Tuppence’s spirits rose mercurially. Mr. Carter’s warnings passed unheeded. The young lady had far too much confidence in herself to pay any heed to them. With some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had sketched out for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain a role indefinitely, she had too much common sense not to recognize the force of Mr. Carter’s arguments. There was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning post brought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: “It’s O.K.” scrawled upon it.",0
"“Yes it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was imprisoned. Of course, at the time I didn’t even know if I was in London. One thing was worrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave a great throb of relief when I saw my ulster lying carelessly over the back of a chair. And the magazine was still rolled up in the pocket! “If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I looked carefully round the walls. There didn’t seem to be a peep-hole of any kind nevertheless I felt kind of sure there must be. All of a sudden I sat down on the edge of the table, and put my face in my hands, sobbing out a ‘Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!’ I’ve got very sharp ears.",0
"I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!_” Diamonds! I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. “Are you sure, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear.",0
"I imitated her example most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined.",0
"I’ve met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her, and should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn ass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her. He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work.",0
"“I’m not sure I have,” said Tuppence darkly. On inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to his suite. An impatient voice cried “Come in” in answer to the page-boy’s knock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in. Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either Tommy or Tuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as thirty-five. He was of middle height, and squarely built to match his jaw. His face was pugnacious but pleasant. No one could have mistaken him for anything but an American, though he spoke with very little accent.",0
"The hall porter proved to have a master key, and after a few difficulties he consented to use it. Poirot went straight to the inner room. A whiff of chloroform met us. On the floor was Sonia Daviloff, gagged and bound, with a great wad of saturated cotton wool over her nose and mouth. Poirot tore it off and began to take measures to restore her. Presently a doctor arrived, and Poirot handed her over to his charge and drew aside with me. There was no sign of Dr. Savaronoff. ""What does it all mean?"" I asked, bewildered.",0
"It was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out. We came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in our tour. I found him studying the centre table with close attention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany table. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but the three dessert plates were untouched. There were three coffee-cups with remains of coffee in them two black, one with milk.",0
"""That may have been done some time ago,” I interrupted. “No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a fragment of some dark green fabric only a thread or two, but recognizable.” “Ah!” I cried. “That was what you sealed up in the envelope.” “Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s own dresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, this!” With a dramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing-table.",0
"""Come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of details as clues?” “By no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger is they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant; one or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells” he tapped his forehead “on which one must rely. The senses mislead. One must seek the truth within not without.” “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?” “That is exactly what I do mean granted the facts were placed before me.",0
"We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your father? A very interesting man on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them.",0
"There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured.",0
"""Will you swear it?” “Yes, yes,” said the other impatiently. “I swear it.” Tuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass. “Very well.” Her mouth opened meekly. Mrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the moment. Then, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she could. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs. Vandemeyer’s face, and during her momentary gasp, Tuppence’s right hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand.",0
"Still my guide plodded on, turning and twisting through mean streets and byways, until at last he stopped at a dilapidated house and rapped four times upon the door. It was opened immediately by another Chinaman who stood aside to let us pass in. The clanging to of the door behind me was the knell of my last hopes. I was indeed in the hands of the enemy. I was now handed over to the second Chinaman. He led me down some rickety stairs and into a cellar which was filled with bales and casks and which exhaled a pungent odour, as of Eastern spices.",0
"Now it was empty. NOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the ease and simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to Sir James’s skilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs. Vandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral. He doubted whether an inquest would be necessary. If so, he would let Sir James know. He understood that Mrs.",0
"He says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure.” “He does, does he? That is very interesting very interesting,” murmured Poirot softly. “And Mrs. Cavendish?” A faint cloud passed over John’s face. “I have not the least idea what my wife’s views on the subject are.” The answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort: “I told you, didn’t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?” Poirot bent his head. “It’s an awkward position for all of us.",0
"I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it.",0
"I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.",0
"Exquisitely dressed in black, with wonderful pearls, I recognised the lady first known to us as Countess Vera Rossakoff, and afterwards under a different alias as an agent of the Big Four. Poirot, for some reason or other, had always had a sneaking fondness for the countess. Something in her very flamboyance attracted the little man. She was, he was wont to declare in moments of enthusiasm, a woman in a thousand. That she was arrayed against us, on the side of our bitterest enemies, never seemed to weigh in his judgment.",0
"In his hand he was brandishing a leg of mutton! ""My dear Poirot!"" I cried. ""What is the matter? Have you suddenly gone mad?"" ""Regard, I pray you, this mutton. But regard it closely!"" I regarded it as closely as I could, but could see nothing unusual about it. It seemed to me a very ordinary leg of mutton. I said as much. Poirot threw me a withering glance. ""But do you not see this and this and this "" He illustrated each ""this"" with a jab at the unoffending joint, dislodging small icicles as he did so.",0
"It was extremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it indeed, it would have been fatal for Tuppence’s plans, since the badge in question was the device of a local training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early days of the war. Its presence in Tuppence’s coat was due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or two before.",0
"“In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!” He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a how do you call it? ‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.” I laughed.",0
"” Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket. “It is now a quarter to nine.” “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully. “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur it may come in useful. Now for the details the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?” “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.",0
"He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was Greg’s wedding present to me.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet who knows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.” I complied. “Voyons!” said Poirot, turning the leaves. “When is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in three days’ time. Eh bien, madame, you seek my advice I give it to you. This belle histoire may be a hoax but it may not! Therefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.",0
"Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.",0
"A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace.",0
"Thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly unsatisfactory. It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and look up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow. At the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might have as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on my diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the “Apartments” card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and tapped on the door. An old woman came and opened it.",0
"""Say, mister,"" he drawled, ""what's this Big Four idea?"" ""The Big Four,"" said Poirot, ""is an international organisation which has at its head a Chinaman. He is known as Number One. Number Two is an American. Number Three is a Frenchwoman. Number Four, the 'Destroyer,' is an Englishman."" ""A Frenchwoman, eh?"" The American whistled. ""And Halliday disappeared in France. Maybe there's something in this. What's her name?"" ""I don't know. I know nothing about her."" ""But it's a mighty big proposition, eh?"" suggested the other. Poirot nodded, as he arranged the glasses in a neat row on the tray.",0
"""Monsieur Henri, an old and trusted friend."" The young man, short and dark, bowed jerkily. Poirot looked round him. There were two other doors besides the one by which we had entered. One, madame explained, led into the garden, the other into a smaller chamber also devoted to research. Poirot took all this in, then declared himself ready to return to the salon. ""Madame, were you alone with M. Halliday during your interview?"" ""Yes, monsieur. My two assistants were in the smaller room next door.",0
"le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “Eh bien! I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice.",0
"""There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! Eh bien! it comes to this are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him.",0
"“There’s something more we want to hear,” continued Mr. Carter. He looked at the American Ambassador. “I speak for you also, I know. We’ll ask Miss Jane Finn to tell us the story that only Miss Tuppence has heard so far but before we do so we’ll drink her health. The health of one of the bravest of America’s daughters, to whom is due the thanks and gratitude of two great countries!” “THAT was a mighty good toast, Jane,” said Mr. Hersheimmer, as he and his cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce to the Ritz. “The one to the joint venture?” “No the one to you.",0
"“It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I observed sarcastically. He considered for a minute. “Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed. It was a curious way of putting it. “Very well,” I said for the third time.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the more it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody else is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements and positively rejoicing in the storm.",0
"He was probably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly. Having already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with ordering a Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington ordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he moved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice. The other man joined in.",0
"""Then you think ” “Mon ami, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave the first one for the moment, what was the second?” “The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses,” I quoted. “Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or Lawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?” “No,” I said thoughtfully. “Of course an actor ” But Poirot cut me short ruthlessly. “And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they are both clean-shaven men.",0
"Seems he laid 'em a wager in the servants' hall that he could get taken for the old man by his nibs that's you, Captain Hastings and would hand him out a lot of spy stuff about a Big Four gang."" ""Impossible!"" I cried. ""Don't you believe it. I marched our gentleman straight to Hatton Chase, and there was the real Ryland in bed and asleep, and the butler and the cook and God knows how many of them to swear to the wager. Just a silly hoax that's all it was and the valet is with him."" ""So that was why he kept in the shadow,"" murmured Poirot. After Japp had gone we looked at each other. ""We know, Hastings,"" said Poirot at last. ""Number Two of the Big Four is Abe Ryland.",0
"China was isolated politically yesterday. What is going on out there, nobody knows. No news of any kind, wireless or otherwise, has come through just a complete break and silence!"" ""Li Chang Yen has shown his hand. And the others?"" ""Abe Ryland arrived in England a week ago, and left for the Continent yesterday."" ""And Madame Olivier?"" ""Madame Olivier left Paris last night."" ""For Italy?"" ""For Italy, sir. As far as we can judge, they are both making for the resort you indicated though how you knew that "" ""Ah, that is not the cap with the feather for me! That was the work of Hastings here.",0
"It seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded at the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted a policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street with Miller and saw him. He’s sober enough now, and I don’t mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting he might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer one it is. “He was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins was his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a bad day, and was down on his luck.",0
"I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling.",0
"He can't last long. We rang you up because we found in his pocket a piece of paper with your name and address on it."" I was very much astonished. Nevertheless, after a moment's reflection I said that I would come down at once. St. Giles' Hospital was, I knew, down by the docks, and it occurred to me that the Chinaman might have just come off some ship. It was on my way down there that a sudden suspicion shot into my mind. Was the whole thing a trap? Wherever a Chinaman was, there might be the hand of Li Chang Yen. I remembered the adventure of the Baited Trap.",0
"Then you can see for yourself the truth of my words. Already they should have traced me to the entrance in the Felsenlabyrynth."" Even as he spoke, there was a far off reverberation, and a man ran in shouting incoherently. Ryland sprang up and went out. Madame Olivier moved to the end of the room and opened a door that I had not noticed. Inside I caught a glimpse of a perfectly equipped laboratory which reminded me of the one in Paris. Number Four also sprang up and went out. He returned with Poirot's revolver which he gave to the countess. ""There is no danger of their escaping,"" he said grimly. ""But still you had better have this.",0
"""I don't think even a Russian would murder another man in order not to be beaten at chess and anyway, from all I can make out, the boot was likely to be on the other leg. The doctor is supposed to be very hot stuff second to Lasker they say he is."" Poirot nodded thoughtfully. ""Then what exactly is your little idea?"" he asked. ""Why should Wilson be poisoned? For, I assume, of course, that it is poison you suspect."" ""Naturally. Heart failure means your heart stops beating that's all there is to that. That's what a doctor says officially at the moment, but privately he tips us the wink that he's not satisfied.",0
"You go along and get on with your work.” The chambermaid went unwillingly. “Going to search her?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine. “Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key. Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her. The inspector’s face grew graver. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room.",0
"And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences too! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders. This morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was urbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he alluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that I should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria. “You expect trouble, then?” I asked. His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far.",0
"” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. I could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. For he must have loved her once he must he must to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me.",0
"You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?” “Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.” “We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country.” “Comment? My old friend the Préfet?” Lord Estair shook his head. “One higher than the Préfet. One whose word was once law in Belgium and shall be again! That England has sworn!” Poirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute.",0
"As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the prisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically revoked by his stepmother’s remarriage. He would call evidence to show who did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case. Finally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against other people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to the fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as strong, if not stronger than that against his brother. He would now call the prisoner.",0
"An event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure. The more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the British Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh zest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue. A fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York.",0
"It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly.",0
"""I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said.",0
"How’s that?” “I don’t see that it matters anyway,” said Tommy wearily. “He may have found out some months ago, and removed the papers, then No, by Jove, that won’t wash! They’d have been published at once.” “Sure thing they would! No, some one’s got ahead of us to-day by an hour or so. But how they did it gets my goat.” “I wish that chap Peel Edgerton had been with us,” said Tommy thoughtfully. “Why?” Julius stared. “The mischief was done when we came.” “Yes ” Tommy hesitated. He could not explain his own feeling the illogical idea that the K.C.’s presence would somehow have averted the catastrophe.",0
"The Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road with a few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden. Tommy paid off the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front door bell. As she was about to ring it, he arrested her hand. “What are you going to say?” “What am I going to say? Why, I shall say Oh dear, I don’t know. It’s very awkward.” “I thought as much,” said Tommy with satisfaction. “How like a woman! No foresight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily the mere male deals with the situation.” He pressed the bell.",0
"” Her eyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity. “What is that?” asked the other sharply. “No hesitations, Miss Tuppence. We need to be sure of our going.” But Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied. “It’s so difficult you see, if I’m wrong oh, it would be dreadful.” She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. “Never forgive me,” she observed cryptically. “You want me to help you out, eh?” “Yes, please. You know who Mr. Brown is, don’t you?” “Yes,” said Sir James gravely. “At last I do.” “At last?” queried Tuppence doubtfully. “Oh, but I thought ” She paused.",0
"But au fond, he is very business-like, ce monsieur! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone.",0
"Witnessed by the two servants, Denise and Françoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it back. “Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice ” “The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago. Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his amorous intrigues.” “Yes,” said M.",0
"An old ragged man was shuffling along the opposite side of the road, and when I saw him make a sign to the window, I understood that he was one of the gang on watch. ""It is well,"" said my Chinese friend. ""Hercule Poirot has fallen into the trap. He approaches now and alone except for the boy who guides him. Now, Captain Hastings, you have still one more part to play. Unless you show yourself he will not enter the house. When he arrives opposite, you must go out on the step and beckon him in."" ""What?"" I cried, revolted. ""You play that part alone. Remember the price of failure.",0
"Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the Kilmorden_ either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right.",0
"The Riviera was all right, of course, because one met all one’s friends there. I listened and contained myself with difficulty. Most of these women were rich. The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to wander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London and talked about milkmen and servants! I think now, looking back, that I was perhaps a shade intolerant. But they were stupid stupid even at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily inadequate and muddled housekeeping accounts. My affairs did not progress very fast.",0
"” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s me Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it.",0
"He was burly and bluff and red-faced, with a thick moustache and a hoarse voice. He will be none of those things by this time, and for the rest, he has nondescript eyes, nondescript ears, and a perfect set of false teeth. Identification is not such an easy matter as you seem to think. Next time "" ""You think there will be a next time?"" I interrupted. Poirot's face grew very grave. ""It is a duel to the death, mon ami. You and I on the one side, the Big Four on the other.",0
"Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what your plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.” “But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France without delay.” “We?” “Precisely ‘we!’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish ” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight.",0
"""I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs’s?” “I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.” “And no clerk has had access to them?” Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago in fact on the very day that Philip left us.",0
"Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.” “Yes?” I said, much interested. “There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last the day before yesterday the body of Mr.",0
"Cavendish is a very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly jealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all costs, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp’s despatch-case, which had been lost that morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all important papers in this particular case. “Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done.",0
"Julius P. Hersheimmer.” A faint flush flitted over the girl’s face, as Julius stepped forward and took her hand. “How do, Cousin Jane?” he said lightly. But Tommy caught the tremor in his voice. “Are you really Uncle Hiram’s son?” she asked wonderingly. Her voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an almost thrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy, but he thrust the impression aside as impossible. “Sure thing.” “We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,” continued the girl, in her low soft tones. “But I never thought I’d meet you one day.",0
"” The two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution “Anything you say will be used in evidence against you,” actually hovering on Summerhaye’s lips. Poirot went on. “Do you understand now, monsieur?” “No. What do you mean?” “I mean,” said Poirot deliberately, “that you are suspected of poisoning your wife.” A little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking. “Good heavens!” cried Inglethorp, starting up. “What a monstrous idea! I poison my dearest Emily!” “I do not think” Poirot watched him narrowly “that you quite realize the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest.",0
"And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.",0
"I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see, and went myself in search of Dorcas. When I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty. “Poirot,” I cried, “where are you?” “I am here, my friend.” He had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds. “Admirable!” he murmured. “Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that crescent; and those diamonds their neatness rejoices the eye. The spacing of the plants, also, is perfect.",0
"Her face was so wicked I nearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and asked her in French where I was. “It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been talking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I don’t know why, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt he’d seen right through me, but I went on playing my part.",0
"Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?” “Yes, sir, she did.” “Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.” “Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like I don’t know what exactly she wrote it down for him.” “Well?” “Well, he did, sir.” “And what happened next?” “We went on with the begonias, sir.” “Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?” “Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.",0
"Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, la pauvre dame! She will eat nothing but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, par exemple, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur.",0
"It demolishes my theory it ruins everything it ah, no!” He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest. “It is impossible. I cannot be wrong! The facts, taken methodically and in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I must be right! I am right!” “But then ” He interrupted me. “Wait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is impossible unless unless oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word ” He was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he said in a quiet assured voice: “The victim is a man of middle-age.",0
"As to your question, I’m sure I don’t know.” “You could find out?” asked Poirot with curious persistence. “Oh, certainly if you really want to know.” “Merci, mon ami. I should be obliged if you would make a point of it.” Japp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have forgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and murmuring, “Poor old fellow! War’s been too much for him!” gently withdrew from the room. As Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper, and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend’s voice aroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk and alert.",0
"""What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know but a scar can be faked easily enough. He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of anthropology. “Dolichocephalic,” I said lightly. Suzanne looked doubtful. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,” I explained fluently. There was a pause.",0
"First thing when they had broken the door down, they flung the window open, and the housemaid who did it thinks that it wasn't fastened, but she's a precious bad witness will remember anything you ask her to!"" ""What about the key?"" ""There you are again. It was on the floor among the wreckage of the door. Might have fallen from the keyhole, might have been dropped there by one of the people who entered, might have been slipped underneath the door from the outside."" ""In fact everything is 'might have been'?"" ""You've hit it, Moosior Poirot. That's just what it is.",0
"Cavendish, “this can’t be true!” Miss Howard nodded grimly. “True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won’t forget or forgive in a hurry. Don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. Probably water off a duck’s back, though. I said right out: ‘You’re an old woman, Emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool. The man’s twenty years younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he married you for. Money! Well, don’t let him have too much of it. Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much time he spends over there.’ She was very angry.",0
"He avoided all discussion of the Big Four as far as possible, and seemed to throw himself into his ordinary work with almost his old ardour. Nevertheless, I knew that he was secretly active in the big matter. Extraordinary-looking Slavs were constantly calling to see him, and though he vouchsafed no explanation as to these mysterious activities, I realised that he was building some new defence or weapon of opposition with the help of these somewhat repulsive-looking foreigners.",0
"Japp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity. “Can’t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink’s as good as a nod from you. You’ve been on the spot and the Yard doesn’t want to make any mistakes, you know.” Poirot nodded gravely. “That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos the case against him will be dismissed at once! Comme ça!” And he snapped his fingers expressively. Japp’s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.",0
"There was clearly nothing to be done until I could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long soothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental over him. In her way which of course is quite different from me and Harry she is really fond of Clarence. “I do wish he was here, Anne,” she gulped. “It’s such a long time since I’ve seen him.” “Have some face cream,” I said soothingly. Suzanne rubbed a little on the tip of her charming nose. “I shall want some more face cream soon too,” she remarked, “and you can only get this kind in Paris.” She sighed.",0
"Now I’ll sit opposite you with the revolver in front of me just in case of accidents. Splendid. Now, let’s talk.” “What about?” said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly. Tuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering several things. Boris’s words, “I believe you would sell us!” and her answer, “The price would have to be enormous,” given lightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: “Who’s been blabbing? Rita?” Would Rita Vandemeyer prove to be the weak spot in the armour of Mr.",0
"But the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirot’s voice rose in mild reproof. “Never will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would I permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, mon ami.” This to the Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof: “See now, what I have done for you. I have saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our beautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and front. Straight into the arms of the police they will go.",0
"” A fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police court proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It had been found in Mrs. Inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversed at a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which I die possessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...” This placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased lady’s husband.",0
"It opened noiselessly and we stepped into the garden. And then, with complete unexpectedness, the blow fell. In a minute we were surrounded, gagged and bound. At least ten men must have been waiting for us. Resistance was useless. Like two helpless bundles we were lifted up and carried along. To my intense astonishment, they took us towards the house and not away from it. With a key they opened the door into the laboratory and carried us into it. One of the men stooped down before the big safe. The door of it swung open.",0
"She did not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was. She couldn’t even speak her own tongue.” “But surely all this is most unusual?” put in Julius. “No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe shock to the nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same lines. I suggested a specialist, of course. There’s a very good man in Paris makes a study of these cases but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that might result from such a course.” “I can imagine she would,” said Sir James grimly. “I fell in with her views.",0
"But since then I’ve remembered what the young gentlemen” John and Lawrence were still the “young gentlemen” to Dorcas “call the ‘dressing-up box.’ It’s up in the front attic, sir. A great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them. So, if you’d tell the Belgian gentleman ” “I will tell him, Dorcas,” I promised. “Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite a different class from them two detectives from London, what goes prying about, and asking questions.",0
"“Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers for which I shall be hauled over the coals and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town. It’s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as he was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.” I paused for breath. “You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I spoke.” “What? Pagett?” I cried, in lively astonishment.",0
"” He picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open window in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and Poirot stood aside to let her pass. “Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.” “Yes?” she turned inquiringly. “Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicines?” A slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly: “No.” “Only her powders?” The flush deepened as Cynthia replied: “Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.” “These?” Poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders. She nodded. “Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?” “No, they were bromide powders.",0
"“Well, I’m damned! If that’s ” Julius hastened to interrupt. “Say now, don’t be hasty. I don’t mean what you mean. I take it Americans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even. What I meant was that the French set about marriage in a businesslike way find two people who are suited to one another, look after the money affairs, and see the whole thing practically, and in a businesslike spirit.” “If you ask me,” said Tommy, “we’re all too damned businesslike nowadays. We’re always saying, ‘Will it pay?’ The men are bad enough, and the girls are worse!” “Cool down, son. Don’t get so heated.",0
"” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was omniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.",0
"“Well, here goes,” murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former remark. “Damn!” he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up. In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips, with the brief command “Drink.” Tommy obeyed. The potency of the draught made him choke, but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner. He was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held. On one side of him was the German, on the other the villainous-faced doorkeeper who had let him in. The others were grouped together at a little distance away. But Tommy missed one face.",0
"The Government would be broken finally and completely.” “Then what more do you want?” “The document itself,” said the German bluntly. “Ah! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?” “No.” “Does anyone know where it is?” “One person perhaps. And we are not sure of that even.” “Who is this person?” “A girl.” Tommy held his breath. “A girl?” The Russian’s voice rose contemptuously. “And you have not made her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk.” “This case is different,” said the German sullenly. “How different?” He paused a moment, then went on: “Where is the girl now?” “The girl?” “Yes.” “She is ” But Tommy heard no more.",0
"And suddenly a baleful idea shot across my mind? Was I not already falling into the trap? Suppose that this Chinaman had merely assumed the part of Ingles's servant, that he was in reality an agent of the Big Four? Had I not once read that certain Chinese priests were capable of simulating death? Or, to go further still, Li Chang Yen might command a little band of fanatics who would welcome death itself if it came at the command of their master. I must be on my guard. Even as these thoughts flashed across my mind, the man in the bed stirred. His eyes opened. He murmured something incoherently.",0
"Tuppence is my girl! I’ve always loved her, from the time we played together as kids. We grew up and it was just the same. I shall never forget when I was in hospital, and she came in in that ridiculous cap and apron! It was like a miracle to see the girl I loved turn up in a nurse’s kit ” But Julius interrupted him. “A nurse’s kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I could swear I’ve seen Jane in a nurse’s cap too. And that’s plumb impossible! No, by gum, I’ve got it! It was her I saw talking to Whittington at that nursing home in Bournemouth.",0
"I dare say it’s only a silly hoax Gregory says so but it’s just worrying me to death.” She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement. “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.” “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot. The latter scrutinized them closely. “Cheap paper the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure. I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.",0
"If we’re ever going to get hold of her at all, we must do it before the 29th her life won’t be worth an hour’s purchase afterwards. The hostage game will be played out by then. I’m beginning to feel that we’ve made a big mistake in the way we’ve set about this. We’ve wasted time and we’re no forrader.” “I’m with you there. We’ve been a couple of mutts, who’ve bitten off a bigger bit than they can chew. I’m going to quit fooling right away!” “What do you mean?” “I’ll tell you. I’m going to do what we ought to have done a week ago.",0
"You say no one else was near enough to see what happened?” “I had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can’t be sure and, anyway, they wouldn’t be as near as I was.” The inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure. The deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been found in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel.",0
"""Fate is playing into our hands. We must start at once though. What stupendous luck."" ""So that was why he came,"" murmured Poirot. ""I see it all now."" ""See what? Come on, Poirot, don't stay daydreaming there."" Poirot looked at me, and slowly shook his head, smiling as he did so. ""'Will you walk into my parlour, said the spider to the fly?' That is your little English nursery rhyme, is it not? No, no they are subtle but not so subtle as Hercule Poirot.",0
"Mother will be glad when father's dead and she can marry Dr. Treves. She isn't my own mother, you know. I don't like her. She wants father to die."" It was all rather horrible. Luckily, before Poirot had time to reply, the doctor came back, and we had to carry on a forced conversation. And then suddenly Poirot lay back in his chair with a hollow groan. His face was contorted with pain. ""My dear sir, what's the matter?"" cried the doctor. ""A sudden spasm. I am used to them. No, no, I require no assistance from you, doctor. If I might lie down upstairs.",0
"“I wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me? A woman’s hair h’m!” We lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris. “Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find this.” He took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the reproduction of a woman’s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an exclamation. “You recognize it, my friend?” I nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back, and the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was unmistakable.",0
"But I decided that if I made any interesting and important discoveries as no doubt I should I would keep them to myself, and surprise Poirot with the ultimate result. There are times when it is one’s duty to assert oneself. I had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot’s message to Lawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a grudge against my friend’s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about, with a still more ancient mallet.",0
"""What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body. I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.” “Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.” “I beg your pardon, my friend one can always be mistaken. Regard a great actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs.",0
"So, if anyone did manage to rob me of it, it wouldn’t matter. “What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I opened it out flat there were only two sheets and laid it between two of the advertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the two pages together round the edge with some gum off an envelope. I carried the magazine carelessly stuffed into the pocket of my ulster.",0
"But to my intense surprise I heard a light footfall on the deck behind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned. “I want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last night.” “It it was a peculiar night,” I said hastily. It was not a very lucid remark, but it was absolutely the only thing I could think of. “Will you forgive me?” I held out my hand without a word. He took it. “There’s something else I want to say.” His gravity deepened.",0
"Then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear. “Look, mon ami!” cried Poirot in triumph. I looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was dated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike, confectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman. “But is it legal?” I gasped. “As far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the testator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.",0
"“He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none.",0
"“Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.",0
"” The car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure climbed suddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the midst of them. “Sorry,” said Tommy, extricating himself. A mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them severally: “Was in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn’t let you know before at the pace you were going. It was all I could do to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!” “Get out?” “Yes. There’s a station just up that road. Train due in three minutes. You’ll catch it if you hurry.” “What the devil are you driving at?” demanded Julius.",0
"” Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: “I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.” We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I thought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as ever, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor.",0
"The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind. Was it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was prejudiced the Tube incident was my own pet mystery but there certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the two fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face evidently an Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me to what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland Yard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of the Mill House case.",0
"""Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?” “I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are divided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring to make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as against John and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.” Detective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial was reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly.",0
"You shall go to Beira” “I’m not going to Beira,” I interrupted. “You are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself and throw you on to the boat. What do you think I’m made of? Do you think I’ll wake up night after night, fearing they’ve got you? One can’t go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back to England, Anne and and marry and be happy.” “With a steady man who’ll give me a good home!” “Better that than utter disaster.” “And what of you?” His face grew grim and set. “I’ve got my work ready to hand. Don’t ask what it is.",0
"Taxis were plentiful here, and before Whittington’s had driven off another was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy’s peremptory hand. “Follow that other taxi,” directed the young man. “Don’t lose it.” The elderly chauffeur showed no interest. He merely grunted and jerked down his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy’s taxi came to rest at the departure platform just after Whittington’s. Tommy was behind him at the booking-office. He took a first-class single ticket to Bournemouth, Tommy did the same. As he emerged, Boris remarked, glancing up at the clock: “You are early. You have nearly half an hour.",0
"""Why, what was there to lie about?” “You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?” “Yes more or less.” “You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that ‘July 17th’ is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I mean?” “No,” I confessed, “I don’t.",0
"“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.",0
"Poirot paused, looking across at the house, whilst the boy spoke to him eagerly and pointed. It was the time for me to act. I went out in the hall. At a sign from the tall Chinaman, one of the servants unlatched the door. ""Remember the price of failure,"" said my enemy in a low voice. I was outside on the steps. I beckoned to Poirot. He hastened across. ""Aha! So all is well with you, my friend. I was beginning to be anxious. You managed to get inside? Is the house empty, then?"" ""Yes,"" I said, in a voice I strove to make natural.",0
"But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place. I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something.",0
"She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that it is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand, Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could. All this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne’s full approval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a psychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards).",0
"""Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.” “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?” “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.” “You would be doing the Government a great service a very great service. You would not find them er ungrateful.” “Meaning, you want me to be the postman?” “Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is bona fide. Everything would be eminently satisfactory.” “Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.",0
"The news was unpleasant. I read into Ingles's death a sinister motive. Not for one moment did I believe the theory of an accident. Ingles had been murdered, and his death was only too clearly the handiwork of that accursed Big Four. As I sat there, stunned by the blow, and turning the whole matter over in my mind, I was startled by the remarkable behaviour of the man sitting opposite me. So far I had not paid much attention to him. He was a thin, dark man of middle age, sallow of complexion, with a small pointed beard. He had sat down opposite me so quietly that I had hardly noticed his arrival.",0
"Ah, but it was magnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry. So successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from Flat II at that time.” “Except Hercule Poirot, I suppose?” I said sarcastically.",0
"No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological heredity, mon ami, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?” “About five, I believe.” “That will do very well. We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.",0
"‘No unreasonable offer refused if pay is good.’ How’s that?” “I shouldn’t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.” “It couldn’t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now I’ll read it straight through. ‘Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer refused.’ How would that strike you if you read it?” “It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a lunatic.” “It’s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning ‘Petunia’ and signed ‘Best Boy.",0
"It was already a few minutes past the dinner hour. Suddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed in the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress. Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there with one hand just touching the necklace. “Behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to have vanished. “Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.” The switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened.",0
"Sir James had drawn a watch from his pocket. “The boat train to Holyhead stops at Chester at 12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch the connection.” Tommy looked up, puzzled. “Is there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th.” “I guess it’s always well to get up early in the morning,” said Julius, before the lawyer had time to reply. “We’ll make tracks for the depot right away.” A little frown had settled on Sir James’s brow. “I wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at two o’clock. It is unfortunate.” The reluctance in his tone was very evident.",0
"“Have you hit him?” cried Tuppence eagerly. “Sure,” replied Julius. “He isn’t killed, though. Skunks like that take a lot of killing. Are you all right, Tuppence?” “Of course I am. Where’s Tommy? And who’s this?” She indicated the shivering Kramenin. “Tommy’s making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought you’d turned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George! That’s right. It’ll take ‘em at least five minutes to get busy after us. They’ll use the telephone, I guess, so look out for snares ahead and don’t take the direct route. Who’s this, did you say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur Kramenin. I persuaded him to come on the trip for his health.",0
"""Comment?” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things.",0
"""Of course,” began Giraud, “I soon saw through all that Chilian tomfoolery. Two men were in it but they were not mysterious foreigners! All that was a blind.” “Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “Especially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.” Giraud glared, but continued: “A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the grave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there was a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld’s quarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The motive was established.",0
"“I make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless Célestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room in the morning while Célestine is present, and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise she never enters the room.” “Well, as I was saying,” continued Mrs. Opalsen, “I came up. I went to the drawer here,” she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table “took out my jewel-case and unlocked it. It seemed quite as usual but the pearls were not there!” The inspector had been busy with his notebook. “When had you last seen them?” he asked.",0
"One or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes, and cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that the person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp’s medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed. “Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.",0
"“It is queer, isn’t it? You don’t think that that the place is haunted?” “Never heard of a haunted flat,” declared Parker decisively. “N-o.” Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. “But there were several things about it all that struck me as well, queer.” “For instance” I suggested. “Ah,” said Parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused! Unburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries.” I laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle thrust upon me.",0
"I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life. If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13” like that. There was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle.",0
"Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.” And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar.",0
"""Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between the note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the jury,” said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has done his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate perjury. After this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday. Poirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that little frown between the eyes that I knew so well. “What is it, Poirot?” I inquired. “Ah, mon ami, things are going badly, badly.” In spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief.",0
"The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too many eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is mentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her doing. “We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning being so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.” Poirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her face. “All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most awful hour of my life.",0
"""Affairs are already in train. Every day cautiously worded advertisements will appear. Friends and relatives of one or the other will be asked to communicate with my solicitor at his office. Even to-day we might Aha, the telephone! Probably it is, as usual, the wrong number, and they will regret to have troubled us, but it may be yes, it may be that something has arisen."" I crossed the room and picked up the receiver. ""Yes, yes. M. Poirot's rooms. Yes, Captain Hastings speaking. Oh, it's you, Mr. McNeil! (McNeil and Hodgson were Poirot's solicitors.) I'll tell him.",0
"It seemed that Ryland was looking for an English secretary, one with a good social manner and presence. It was Poirot's suggestion that I should apply for the post. ""I would do it, myself, mon ami,"" he explained apologetically. ""But, see you, it is almost impossible for me to disguise myself in the needful manner. I speak the English very well except when I am excited but hardly so as to deceive the ear; and even though I were to sacrifice my moustaches, I doubt not but that I should still be recognisable as Hercule Poirot."" I doubted it also, and declared myself ready and willing to take up the part and penetrate into Ryland's household. ""Ten to one he won't engage me anyway,"" I remarked.",0
"Clearly any scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the moment. For the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing. Tuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing to disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was congratulatory. “That’s all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that hundred thousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it did over night. There’s nothing to worry over.",0
"“The birds have flown as we thought. We might as well go over it.” Going over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the character of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The prison room with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the attic, the meeting room with its long table. But nowhere was there a trace of papers. Everything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away. And there was no sign of Annette. “What you tell me about the girl puzzled me,” said Mr. Carter.",0
"""Any trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good terms?” “I should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful. Mrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a nonentity, I think.” “Then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had he any enemies?” “He had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular good-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him and, if they had, where is the body?” “Exactly.",0
"He is a semi-invalid, and seldom goes out, living alone with a niece, Sonia Daviloff, and a Russian man-servant in a flat down Westminster way. It is possible that he still considers himself a marked man. Certainly he was very unwilling to agree to this chess contest. He refused several times point blank, and it was only when the newspapers took it up and began making a fuss about the 'unsportsmanlike refusal' that he gave in. Gilmour Wilson had gone on challenging him with real Yankee pertinacity, and in the end he got his way.",0
"""And pray, what are they?” “One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last autumn.” “Poirot, you are joking!” “I am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not forget my little commission.” But the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about eleven o’clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read it out: “‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’” “Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!” I stared at him.",0
"A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said.",0
"I passed through, and to my utter astonishment found myself in a kind of Arabian Nights' palace. A low long subterranean chamber hung with rich oriental silks, brilliantly lighted and fragrant with perfumes and spices. There five or six silk covered divans, and exquisite carpets of Chinese workmanship covered the ground. At the end of the room was a curtained recess. From behind these curtains came a voice. ""You have brought our honoured guest?"" ""Excellency, he is here,"" replied my guide. ""Let our guest enter,"" was the answer.",0
"""As always,"" I said coldly, ""it doesn't leap to mine."" ""Because you will not use your little gray cells. Who had a chance to tamper with the curry?"" ""Ah Ling. No one else."" ""No one else? What about the doctor?"" ""But that was afterwards."" ""Of course it was afterwards. There was no trace of powdered opium in the curry served to Mr. Paynter, but acting in obedience to the suspicions Dr. Quentin had aroused, the old man eats none of it, and preserves it to give to his medical attendant, whom he summons according to plan. Dr. Quentin arrives, takes charge of the curry, and gives Mr.",0
"By common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that the Count’s mannerisms had dropped from him, could doubt that it was his native language. He had, indeed, started life as a quick-change music-hall artiste in London. “You had a great success to-night,” he remarked. “I congratulate you.” “All the same,” said the woman, “I am disturbed. My position is not what it was. The suspicions aroused during the War have never died down. I am continually watched and spied upon.” “But no charge of espionage was ever brought against you?” “Our chief lays his plans too carefully for that.” “Long life to the ‘Colonel,’” said the Count, smiling.",0
"I didn't take much stock in the matter, but I remembered what he said, and when the captain here came over with rather a curious story, I said at once, 'We'll go round to Moosior Poirot's.'"" Poirot looked across at Captain Kent, and the American took up the tale. ""You may remember reading, M. Poirot, that a number of torpedo boats and destroyers were sunk by being dashed upon the rocks off the American coast. It was just after the Japanese earthquake, and the explanation given was that the disaster was the result of a tidal wave.",0
"The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.” “Pardon, how was it paid?” “In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.” “Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?” “In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with the man.” “And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?” “I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.” Poirot looked at him and shook his head.",0
"What a consummate hypocrite the man was! “I must hurry on,” I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I was bound. In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage. Getting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me was cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out. He gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words, I explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help. “Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the affair whilst I dress.” In a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his room.",0
"“I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I I excuse me” He bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly.",0
"They were a pleasant couple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin, and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm. Tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s constant resting-place.",0
"“I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real.",0
"Her face was heavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly. “Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,” said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear voice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock. Then it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock. A strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold.",0
"""Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony.",0
"You’re a thief, remember, a thief. There’s one thing you don’t know, perhaps. I’ve got the diamonds. And here goes” With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite. “There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we’ll talk. I’ll drive a bargain with you. You’ve got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. There’s a chance for me if I can get away. I’m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man! There’s a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes’ start and I shall be all right.",0
"“And well I know it, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And I’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn’t know as there was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately, I think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of hair. Burnt corks they use mostly though ‘tis messy getting it off again. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.” “So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,” said Poirot thoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again. “Do you think it is the one?” I whispered eagerly. Poirot nodded. “I do. You notice it had been trimmed?” “No.",0
"The girl’s clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she’s ferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house. She was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a deduction quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather that she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have these intuitions I’ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess but to call it a deduction is absurd. How she ever got on the staff of the Daily Budget is more than I can imagine.",0
"As long as I might be thought to be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will be doubly careful. Yes doubly careful.” He turned to me abruptly. “Tell me, Hastings, you yourself have you no suspicions of anybody?” I hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in itself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted. “You couldn’t call it a suspicion,” I murmured. “It’s so utterly foolish.” “Come now,” urged Poirot encouragingly. “Do not fear. Speak your mind.",0
"“‘To speak or not to speak,’ as your so great Shakespeare says, ‘that is the question.’” I did not trouble to correct the quotation. “You are not serious, Poirot?” “I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance.” “And that is?” “A woman’s happiness, mon ami,” he said gravely. I did not quite know what to say. “The moment has come,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “and I do not know what to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one but I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!” And he tapped himself proudly on the breast.",0
"” I shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed. “But console yourself, mon ami,” said Poirot, calming down. “All cannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.” “You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever knew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance. “What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share that opinion even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “Without doubt. She is coming here.” “How do you make that out?” “Very simply.",0
"Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels.",0
"“At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.” Pagett’s voice dropped again. “But that’s camouflage, I’m sure. So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck.",0
"“When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” “When I began to work the right way from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a mind like mine!” The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received.",0
"“Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American millionaire of unfortunate ancestry? At all events we’ll call at lunch-time. It’s a good time frequently leads to free food for two.” Tuppence nodded assent. “Now for Carter. We’ll have to hurry.” Carshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence called “ladylike looking houses.” They rang the bell at No. 27, and a neat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppence’s heart sank. Upon Tommy’s request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground floor where she left them.",0
"The will disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish, I much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.” “Suggestive, or not,” interrupted John, “we are most grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur, what first led you to suspect the fact?” Poirot smiled and answered: “A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.",0
"Then, when I had told him kindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking about some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge at Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort. I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter. I thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because the typewriter was sure to have gone wrong it always does and he would have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten Pagett’s powers of being in the right. “I’ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace.",0
"Hastings, there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can happen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘I am a leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.” “What?” I ejaculated. “It was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the South Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough.",0
"What does it all mean?” Poirot handed him the copy of Society Gossip. “First, milord, I would ask you if these facts are substantially correct?” The peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read. “Damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “There’s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I believe. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.” “Still, the stone is known as ‘The Star of the East.’” “Well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully. Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply.",0
"By the way, you said two minutes and you’ve been three, allowing for interruptions. For a woman, that’s quite remarkable! Must be your scientific training.” I was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been running. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance. I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively.",0
"The framework of the door was solid, and for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it give beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was burst open. We stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs. Inglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent convulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon the pillows. John strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of the housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.",0
"“It’s quite a common name.” “Ah! Sapristi, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and her husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New York, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the Camorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their track. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler? They offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of young couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be several Robinsons.",0
"And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa.",0
"What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside?” “Well ” I considered. “One must look at it logically.” “True.” “I should put it this way. The doors were bolted our own eyes have told us that yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and the destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone entered the room. You agree so far?” “Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.",0
"The Big Four were not apt to be careless in details. I went home a little sobered. One fact had emerged from the countess's flood of volubility. I was in real danger of my life. Though I had no intention of abandoning the struggle, I saw that it behoved me to walk warily and adopt every possible precaution. Whilst I was reviewing all these facts and seeking for the best line of action, the telephone bell rang. I crossed the room and picked up the receiver. ""Yes. Hallo. Who's speaking?"" A crisp voice answered me. ""This is St. Giles' Hospital. We have a Chinaman here, knifed in the street and brought in.",0
"Add to her genius the powers of Ryland's almost unlimited wealth, and, with the brain of Li Chang Yen, the finest criminal brain ever known, to direct and plan eh bien, it will not be, as you say, all jam for civilisation."" His words made me very thoughtful. Although Poirot was given at times to exaggeration of language, he was not really an alarmist. For the first time I realised what a desperate struggle it was upon which we were engaged. Harvey soon rejoined us and the journey went on. We arrived at Bolzano about midday. From there the journey on was by motor.",0
"""Her faith in you has never wavered. She is waiting for you she and the child."" ""Thank God for that. I can hardly believe that I am free once more."" ""Now that you are a little recovered, monsieur, I should like to hear the whole story from the beginning."" Halliday looked at him with an indescribable expression. ""I remember nothing,"" he said. ""What?"" ""Have you ever heard of the Big Four?"" ""Something of them,"" said Poirot dryly. ""You do not know what I know. They have unlimited power. If I remain silent, I shall be safe if I say one word not only I, but my nearest and dearest will suffer unspeakable things.",0
"There had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance. She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death! “Yes?” Her grave eyes met his inquiringly. He stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution. “It must be!” he muttered to himself.",0
"The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American. Throughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.",0
"If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!” “Do not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are not so easily parted. Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out a tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.” I acknowledged the wisdom of this. “In any case,” continued Poirot, “it is not the money which attracts me here. Certainly it will be pleasant to have carte blanche in our investigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest. You remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?” I considered.",0
"“Let us in, moosior.” “You have our friends safe and sound?” “Yes, we’ve got the birds all right. But they hadn’t got the goods with them.” “I see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with Hastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat.” “For the Lord’s sake, have you gone completely balmy?” “The cat,” declaimed Poirot, “was worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp. To speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I know, considered polite in England.",0
"Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! Un moment, s’il vous plaît.” I joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly startled, came running up to the hedge at his call. “A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?” “Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.” Despite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid. “Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast.",0
I felt my temper stirred. “Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.” “Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his pocket. A lot of other people may have had too only they didn’t happen to be killed.” I rallied my forces. “You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?” “Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.” “And no money.,0
"In an upper room of the Mill House the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday, strangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not been identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.” Nobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited the following facts. Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House.",0
"Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London was uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, mon ami. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler.",0
"“Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.” “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.” “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail.",0
"Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",0
"""Well, as I was saying, these letters come, and there are strict orders that they are never to be opened, but to be handed over to Mr. Ryland intact. And, of course, I always do so. But there was an unusually heavy mail yesterday morning, and I was opening the letters in a terrific hurry. By mistake I opened one of these letters. As soon as I saw what I had done, I took it to Mr. Ryland and explained. To my utter amazement he flew into the most awful rage. As I tell you, I was quite frightened."" ""What was there in the letter, I wonder, to upset him so?"" ""Absolutely nothing that's just the curious part of it.",0
"As she opened the door and stood aside to let him pass out, he stopped in the doorway. “Not been doing this long, eh?” Tuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance kindliness, and something else more difficult to fathom. He nodded as though she had answered. “V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?” “Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?” asked Tuppence suspiciously. “No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?” “Very good, thank you, sir.” “Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change does no harm sometimes.” “Do you mean ?” began Tuppence.",0
"""A woman who enters her home for I presume that it is her home since she enters with a key and runs straight upstairs without even looking at two strange visitors in the hall to see who they are, is a very unusual type of woman quite unnatural, in fact. Mille tonnerres! what is that?"" He dragged me back just in time. A tree had crashed down on to the side walk, just missing us. Poirot stared at it, pale and upset. ""It was a near thing that! But clumsy, all the same for I had no suspicion at least hardly any suspicion.",0
"I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. Eh bien, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’ I had heard, or read, all these things before.",0
"I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive.",0
"It is no good arguing with me. I know.... I remember nothing."" And, getting up, he walked from the room. Poirot's face wore a baffled expression. ""So it is like that, is it?"" he muttered. ""The Big Four win again. What is that you are holding in your hand, Hastings?"" I handed it to him. ""The countess scribbled it before she left,"" I explained. He read it. ""Au revoir. I.V."" ""Signed with her initials I.V. Just a coincidence, perhaps, that they also stand for Four. I wonder, Hastings, I wonder.",0
"He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. Eh bien! I must start again!” Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “Pauvre femme,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door.",0
"” Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture. We lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to present itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed maliciously: “Eh bien! And your indiscretions! You recount them not?” I felt myself blushing. “Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance.",0
"I took a sample from each cup, and had them analysed with no result. I had counted the cups carefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had taken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself mistaken. “Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight. Coffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr. Bauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the whole affair, for there was now one cup missing.",0
"What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him. On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent Bridge players and one decent-looking woman Mrs. Clarence Blair.",0
"“You don’t know him,” she reiterated hoarsely. “He’s ah!” With a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched hand pointed over Tuppence’s head. Then she swayed to the ground in a dead faint. Tuppence looked round to see what had startled her. In the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius Hersheimmer. SIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman. “Heart,” he said sharply. “Seeing us so suddenly must have given her a shock. Brandy and quickly, or she’ll slip through our fingers.” Julius hurried to the washstand.",0
"More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a factor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at him searchingly. “I wonder whether, after all, you know as much as we think?” he said softly. Tommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His hold had slipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said wrong? He spoke out on the impulse of the moment. “There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not pretended to be aware of all the details of your show. But equally I’ve got something up my sleeve that you don’t know about. And that’s where I mean to score.",0
"“What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just consult your inclination?” “Well, that depends.” “No secret hobby?” she asked. “Tell me you’re drawn to something? Everyone is usually something absurd.” “You’ll laugh at me.” She smiled. “Perhaps.” “Well, I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!” “The real thing Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?” “Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous detective, and he quite inflamed me.",0
"A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.” “And the Countess?” I inquired with a smile. “Ah! je m’en fiche! Her case was certainly not interesting.” “Why so sure of that?” “Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot wait always remember that, Hastings.” Eleven o’clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover. Before starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed maliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast.",0
"""That difficulty will not exist long,” pronounced Poirot quietly. John looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this cryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given him to me. “Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.” “The rooms are locked?” asked Poirot. “Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.” We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it.",0
"Jeanne went to answer it, and returned with a card in her hand. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at the sight of the name on the card, “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a sudden flicker of interest came into her eyes. “I will see him. The maize peignoir, Jeanne, and quickly. And when the Count comes you may go.” “Bien, Madame.” Jeanne brought the peignoir, an exquisite wisp of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to herself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo on the glass of the dressing-table. The Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to him a man of medium height, very slim, very elegant, very pale, extraordinarily weary.",0
"“Whither away so fast?” “Let us pass, please,” said Tuppence imperiously. “Just a word with your pretty friend here.” He stretched out an unsteady hand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard other footsteps behind. She did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or foes. Lowering her head, she repeated a manœuvre of childish days, and butted their aggressor full in the capacious middle. The success of these unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly on the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they sought was some way down.",0
"He returned with the information that she was undoubtedly “one of the crooks,” but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination. Questioned, he could adduce nothing in support of his statement except his own opinion that she wasn’t the usual kind. You could see that at a glance. The substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage of the real greengrocer’s boy) on the following day, Albert brought back the first piece of hopeful news. There was a French young lady staying in the house. Tommy put his doubts aside. Here was confirmation of his theory. But time pressed. To-day was the 27th.",0
"And as I’ve said before, and shall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!” And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a result of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct route and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments, a telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence.",0
"At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly. With an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at my friend. “Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about this. It’s from Hoffberg. He thinks he’s found a customer for the diamond an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They’re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if this goes through” Words failed him. Lady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her hand.",0
"I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words. What lay beneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time? At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in the background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the spokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John: “Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.” “Is that necessary?” asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his face.",0
“Yes it is the only way.” Then aloud he said abruptly: “You are an American?” “Yes.” “A patriotic one?” The girl flushed. “I guess you’ve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!” “Don’t be offended. You wouldn’t be if you knew how much there was at stake. But I’ve got to trust some one and it must be a woman.” “Why?” “Because of ‘women and children first.’” He looked round and lowered his voice. “I’m carrying papers vitally important papers. They may make all the difference to the Allies in the war.,0
"” Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler’s diary, of which he has kindly begged me to make use. So here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures. I’d always longed for adventures. You see, my life had such a dreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England’s greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really was a genius every one admits that. His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic times, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body inhabited the modern world.",0
"” And Tommy came to an abrupt halt. There was silence for a moment. “By the way,” said Julius suddenly, “you’re all wrong about that photograph of Jane. It was taken from me, but I found it again.” “Where?” cried Tuppence. “In that little safe on the wall in Mrs. Vandemeyer’s bedroom.” “I knew you found something,” said Tuppence reproachfully. “To tell you the truth, that’s what started me off suspecting you. Why didn’t you say?” “I guess I was a mite suspicious too.",0
"We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud. Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them.",0
"What drama is this being played? Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her? Or are they the scoundrels, and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?” “The great detective, mon ami, chooses, as ever, the simplest course. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at the window. In a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle. “As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism. That is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, en passant, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!” I laughed.",0
"I came out on to the stoep early on the following morning and looked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer’s wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the stoep_, a book in my hand which I did not read.",0
"“Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my express wishes?” “If I choose.” “You defy me?” “No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have you no friends of whom I should disapprove?” John fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face. “What do you mean?” he said, in an unsteady voice. “You see!” said Mary quietly. “You do see, don’t you, that you have no right to dictate to me as to the choice of my friends?” John glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face. “No right? Have I no right, Mary?” he said unsteadily. He stretched out his hands.",0
"The detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion. “You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about the case. Let’s hear your views.” “One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M. Giraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there nothing it reminds you of?” “Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so, though.” “You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember but I shall do so.",0
""" Poirot said no more. He took the man in to see the body. The identification came immediately. ""That's him right enough,"" said the keeper callously; ""funny sort of bloke, ain't he? Well, gentlemen, I had best go off now and make arrangements under the circumstances. We won't trouble you with the corpse much longer. If there's a hinquest, you will have to appear at it, I dare say. Good morning, sir."" With a rather uncouth bow he shambled out of the room. A few minutes later Japp arrived. The Scotland Yard Inspector was jaunty and dapper as usual.",0
"He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?” His eyes challenged us. “But I Hercule Poirot tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within here!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within.",0
"The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county.",0
"Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she’d shake her head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very emphatic once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The rain had stopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does. “Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying. He got up, and so did she. He looked towards the window and asked something I guess it was whether it was raining. Anyway, she came right across and looked out. Just then the moon came out from behind the clouds.",0
"They had sent the beard, as directed, to “L. Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court.” Sir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously. “Where was the letter written from?” “From Styles Court.” “The same address to which you sent the parcel?” “Yes.” “And the letter came from there?” “Yes.” Like a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him: “How do you know?” “I I don’t understand.” “How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the postmark?” “No but ” “Ah, you did not notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so confidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any postmark?” “Y es.",0
"I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend. “Bien!” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves.",0
"I was just out of my bath and indulging in pleasurable thoughts of breakfast when I heard Japp's voice in the sitting-room. I threw on a bathrobe and hurried in. ""A pretty mare's nest you've got us into this time,"" Japp was saying. ""It's too bad of you, M. Poirot. First time I've ever known you take a toss."" Poirot's face was a study. Japp went on. ""There were we, taking all this Black Hand stuff seriously and all the time it was the footman."" ""The footman?"" I gasped. ""Yes, James, or whatever his name is.",0
"""Then young Beresford is now?” “At Gatehouse, Kent, unless I am much mistaken.” Mr. Carter looked at him curiously. “I rather wonder you’re not there too, Peel Edgerton?” “Ah, I’m busy on a case.” “I thought you were on your holiday?” “Oh, I’ve not been briefed. Perhaps it would be more correct to say I’m preparing a case. Any more facts about that American chap for me?” “I’m afraid not. Is it important to find out who he was?” “Oh, I know who he was,” said Sir James easily. “I can’t prove it yet but I know.” The other two asked no questions.",0
"I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up.",0
"By the time I had disentangled myself, my quarry was just passing through the doorway, and the next delay was from a waiter carrying a huge pile of plates who crashed into me without the least warning. By the time I got to the door there was no sign of the thin man with the dark beard. The waiter was fulsome in apologies, the fat man was sitting placidly at a table ordering his lunch. There was nothing to show that both occurrences had not been a pure accident. Nevertheless, I had my own opinion as to that. I knew well enough that the agents of the Big Four were everywhere. Needless to say, I paid no heed to the warning given me.",0
"I regret to say that at the first roll the Kilmorden gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a totally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South Kensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office. I smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room. Mrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered. “Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over with you.",0
"But if, by any chance, it was not her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings (it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told her as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out (according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession! “In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open.",0
"She might learn something from the cook. Nothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence pressed the bell again, keeping her finger on the button for some little while. At last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment later Mrs. Vandemeyer herself opened the door. She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the girl. “You?” “I had a touch of toothache, ma’am,” said Tuppence glibly. “So thought it better to come home and have a quiet evening.” Mrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence pass into the hall.",0
"“There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated.",0
"As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.",0
"“You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?” “I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad. “Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate. “After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly realized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last.",0
"Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo’burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn’t seen him this morning.",0
"Listen as he would, Tommy could only catch a word here and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some directions or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion, and with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree. Whittington addressed the other as Boris. Tommy caught the word “Ireland” several times, also “propaganda,” but of Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in the clatter of the room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington was speaking. “Ah, but you don’t know Flossie. She’s a marvel. An archbishop would swear she was his own mother.",0
"What on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing in Julius Hersheimmer’s writing-table? THE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous fingers. His face was worn and harassed. He took up his conversation with Mr. Carter at the point it had broken off. “I don’t understand,” he said. “Do you really mean that things are not so desperate after all?” “So this lad seems to think.” “Let’s have a look at his letter again.” Mr. Carter handed it over. It was written in a sprawling boyish hand. “DEAR MR.",0
"She felt morally battered to the ground after her conflict with Julius’s vigorous personality. Sitting down in front of the glass, she stared at her own reflection for some minutes. “Fool,” murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. “Little fool. Everything you want everything you’ve ever hoped for, and you go and bleat out ‘no’ like an idiotic little sheep. It’s your one chance. Why don’t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?” As if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small snapshot of Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby frame.",0
"Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech atWhat’s the matter? Why aren’t you taking it down?” “I think,” said Colonel Race gently, “that Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.",0
"’ He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed.",0
"All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly.",0
"I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin.",0
"""What on earth are you driving at, Poirot?"" ""My friend, I have been asking myself the reason of this morning's visit. Did our visitor really hope to succeed in bribing me? Or, alternatively, in frightening me into abandoning my task? It seemed hardly credible. Why, then, did he come? And now I see the whole plan very neat very pretty the ostensible reason to bribe or frighten me the necessary struggle which he took no pains to avoid, and which should make the dropped pocket-book natural and reasonable and finally the pitfall! Rue des Echelles, 11 a.m.",0
"Saw you in France when I was with the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew ” Mr. Carter held up his hand. “No names, please. I’m known as Mr. Carter here. It’s my cousin’s house, by the way. She’s willing to lend it to me sometimes when it’s a case of working on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now” he looked from one to the other “who’s going to tell me the story?” “Fire ahead, Tuppence,” directed Tommy. “It’s your yarn.” “Yes, little lady, out with it.” And obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story from the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.",0
"It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch.",0
"""Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look. “You told me to get Cabin 17.” There is a touch of the “boy upon the burning deck” about Pagett. “My dear fellow,” I said testily, “I mentioned No. 17 because I happened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn’t mean you to make a stand to the death about it 13 or 28 would have done us equally well.” He looked hurt. “There’s something more, though,” he insisted.",0
"” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair.",0
"How had Sir James managed to track the girl? Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case? And so on. Sir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said: “Just so, just so. Well, she’s found. And that’s the great thing, isn’t it? Eh! Come now, that’s the great thing?” “Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss Tuppence and I thought you’d quit for good and all.” “Ah!” The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed operations on his chin. “You thought that, did you? Did you really? H’m, dear me.” “But I guess I can take it we were wrong,” pursued Julius.",0
"And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this I added to my report.",0
"""And the photograph? When may I have it?"" ""I'll look it out to-night. I think I know where to lay my hand upon it. And I'll send it to you right away."" ""A thousand thanks, mademoiselle. You are all that is of the most amiable. I hope that we shall soon be able to arrange another little lunch together."" ""As soon as you like,"" said Miss Monro. ""I'm willing."" ""Let me see, I do not think that I have your address?"" With a grand air, Miss Monro drew a card from her hand-bag, and handed it to him. It was a somewhat dirty card, and the original address had been scratched out and another substituted in pencil.",0
"” We did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot effected a rapid change of clothing. “I go to London to-night,” he explained. “It is imperative.” “What?” “Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!” “You’ll come a cropper one of these days,” I observed, rather disgusted by his vanity. “Do not be enraged, I beg of you, mon ami. I count on you to do me a service of your friendship.” “Of course,” I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness.",0
"Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M.",0
"""All right. Then we can lock up and go.” I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared to John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was the opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually shy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for him. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather constrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him. But they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like a couple of children.",0
"Desjardeaux positively bounded from his chair, his face purple with emotion. ""Madame Olivier! Impossible! Absurd! It is an insult what you say there!"" Poirot shook his head gently, but made no answer. Desjardeaux looked at him in stupefaction for some moments. Then his face cleared, and he glanced at the Home Secretary and tapped his forehead significantly. ""M. Poirot is a great man,"" he observed. ""But even the great man sometimes he has his little mania, does he not? And seeks in high places for fancied conspiracies. It is well known.",0
"“Don’t take it to heart, lad,” he said kindly. “You did your best. You were up against one of the biggest brains of the century. And you came very near success. Remember that.” “Thank you, sir. It’s awfully decent of you.” “I blame myself. I have been blaming myself ever since I heard this other news.” Something in his tone attracted Tommy’s attention. A new fear gripped at his heart. “Is there something more, sir?” “I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his hand to a sheet on the table. “Tuppence ?” faltered Tommy. “Read for yourself.",0
"I would be a prospective tenant. I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers.",0
"He merely remarked: “Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?” “Not last night, sir, I know she didn’t.” “Why do you know so positively?” “Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she didn’t have any more made up.” “You are quite sure of that?” “Positive, sir.” “Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to sign any paper yesterday?” “To sign a paper? No, sir.” “When Mr. Hastings and Mr.",0
"Details about your past life in England might be more difficult to sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then ” “One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for granted.” Whittington looked surprised. “Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame Colombier’s is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the terms are most liberal.” “Exactly,” said Tuppence. “That’s just it. The terms are almost too liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth that amount of money to you.",0
"But he proceeded diplomatically: “Yes, the ‘Colonel’ has always been a generous paymaster. I attribute much of his success to that and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat. A great brain, undoubtedly a great brain! And an apostle of the maxim, ‘If you want a thing done safely, do not do it yourself!’ Here are we, every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not one of us has anything on him.” He paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with him, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before. “Not one of us,” he mused.",0
"Carter if I can’t be made a Dame!” At seven o’clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea. She returned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups. “Who’s the other cup for?” inquired Julius. “The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?” “Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,” said Julius thoughtfully. “Yes, it does,” admitted Tuppence. “But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps you’d both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see, we don’t know what mood she’ll wake up in.",0
"It’s almighty luck that she didn’t take the wire with her. If she had we’d probably never have traced her. But we’ve got to hustle. Where’s that Bradshaw?” The energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy would probably have sat down to think things out for a good half-hour before he decided on a plan of action. But with Julius Hersheimmer about, hustling was inevitable. After a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy as being more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it in favour of an A.B.C. “Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King’s Cross. Or St.",0
"” Poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling. “They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying strychnine at the village chemist’s, and signing the register in his hand-writing. “On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On Monday, therefore, at six o’clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs. Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards.",0
"London! The place for things to happen. “It’s awfully kind of you,” I said. “Might I really? Just while I’m looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?” “Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something suitable.” I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of “something suitable” and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. “That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?” “Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming” “My wife will be delighted to welcome you.",0
"The man in the corner raised a meek voice. “Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?” The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough. “Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don’t be offended. You’ve asked questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.” I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall. “You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?” “Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened.",0
"He considered me some time in silence, and then fell to work. When I looked at myself in the glass half an hour afterwards, I was amazed. Special shoes caused me to stand at least two inches taller, and the coat I wore was arranged so as to give me a long, lank, weedy look. My eyebrows had been cunningly altered, giving a totally different expression to my face, I wore pads in my cheeks, and the deep tan of my face was a thing of the past. My moustache had gone, and a gold tooth was prominent on one side of my mouth. ""Your name,"" said Poirot, ""is Arthur Neville.",0
"And once I found a man who would talk, a brilliant young Chinese chemist who was a protégé of Li Chang Yen's. He came to me one day, this chemist, and I could see that he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He hinted to me of experiments on which he'd been engaged in Li Chang Yen's palace under the mandarin's direction experiments on coolies in which the most revolting disregard for human life and suffering had been shown. His nerve had completely broken, and he was in the most pitiable state of terror.",0
"The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. “What?” I cried, startled. Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the street. Pagett had followed him. “And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!” “What?” “Yes, Sir Eustace. And that’s not all. I’ve been making inquiries about her” “Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?” “He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop” I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly. “Nothing,” I said. “Go on.",0
"Chut! no more now!” We followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us. Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the typical lawyer’s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the reason of our presence. “You will understand, Wells,” he added, “that this is all strictly private. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind.” “Quite so, quite so,” said Mr. Wells soothingly. “I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.",0
"Well, I dare say it's best for all parties."" ""Was he dangerous?"" ""'Omicidal, d'you mean? Oh, no. 'Armless enough. Persecution mania very acute. Full of secret societies from China that had got him shut up. They're all the same."" I shuddered. ""How long had he been shut up?"" asked Poirot. ""A matter of two years now."" ""I see,"" said Poirot quietly. ""It never occurred to anybody that he might be sane?"" The keeper permitted himself to laugh. ""If he was sane, what would he be doing in a lunatic asylum? They all say they're sane, you know.",0
"The hall was empty. Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to a garage. I went in. “I have met with an accident,” I explained. “I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.” I had not long to wait.",0
"Raikes’s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard’s warnings, but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, “Aunt Emily will send him away, and will never speak to him again.” I was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen. Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could not dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish’s concern in the matter? Mr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper.",0
"The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr. er Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely.",0
"“More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that the man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the affair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.” He stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me of being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the thought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of inspecting a miniature revolution at first hand. “No trains are running from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he continued. “But I can arrange to send you over by private car.",0
"“Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in my power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press ever so little. “Like this and squeeze the life out of you! And then like our unconscious friend here, but with more success fling your dead body to the sharks.",0
"I'm watching the house, and daren't leave. I shall wait for you until six o'clock, and if you haven't come then, I'll have a try at getting into the house on my own. It's too good a chance to miss, and, of course, the boy mightn't find you. But if he does, get him to bring you down here right away. And cover up those precious moustaches of yours in case any one's watching out from the house and might recognise you. ""Yours in haste, ""A. H."" Every word that I wrote plunged me deeper in despair. The thing was diabolically clever.",0
"“I don’t know.” “In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am not dead yet!’ To which you responded: ‘I wish you were!’” The boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him. “I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply. With an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor. “What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with my father. I dare say I said all those things I was so angry I cannot even remember what I said! I was furious I could almost have killed him at that moment there, make the most of that!” He leant back in his chair, flushed and defiant.",0
"There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No and there ought to have been. Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon.",0
"The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful; that she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness. “Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired car. Quickest way to get here.” “Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?” asked John. “No.” “I thought not. Come along, breakfast’s not cleared away yet, and they’ll make you some fresh tea.” He turned to me. “Look after her, Hastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me.",0
"Anyone would have sworn that the butler was a real butler, the footman a real footman only, as it happened, the butler was Whittington! Tommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert’s return. At last that worthy made his appearance. “Well?” cried Tommy eagerly. “It’s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window opened, and something was chucked out.” He handed a scrap of paper to Tommy. “It was wrapped round a letterweight.” On the paper were scrawled three words: “To-morrow same time.” “Good egg!” cried Tommy. “We’re getting going.” “I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone, and chucked it through the window,” continued Albert breathlessly. Tommy groaned.",0
"I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.",0
"The door was opened by a young lad of seventeen or thereabouts, who reminded me vaguely of an acolyte, so ritualistic was his manner. Poirot had taken the trouble to arrange our interview beforehand, as he knew Madame Olivier never received any one without an appointment, being immersed in research work most of the day. We were shown into a small salon, and presently the mistress of the house came to us there. Madame Olivier was a very tall woman, her tallness accentuated by the long white overall she wore, and a coif like a nun's that shrouded her head.",0
"She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much.",0
"She’s a lady’s maid, as far as I remember, so probably won’t be there, and, anyway, she’s not likely.” “Then the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of call.” “Tommy, I’m getting discouraged.” “Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance. And, anyway, we’re only starting. If we draw a blank in London, there’s a fine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.” “True,” said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. “And all expenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen quickly.",0
"""I see they did not come by post, these letters.” “No; they were left by hand by a Chinaman. That is what frightens me.” “Why?” “Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought the stone three years ago.” “I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be” “‘The Western Star,’” finished Miss Marvell. “That’s so. At the time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information. Gregory says he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing.",0
"” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back.",0
"Hautet and say that we will come at once.” Poirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But when he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. “He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly. We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M.",0
"Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.” “Or even longer!” “You’ll hang about outside. When I come out I shan’t speak to you in case he’s watching. But I’ll take up my stand somewhere near, and when he comes out of the building I’ll drop a handkerchief or something, and off you go!” “Off I go where?” “Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?” “Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with nothing to do.",0
"“Of course,” resumed Tuppence, “marriage is my best chance. I made up my mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would! I’m not sentimental, you know.” She paused. “Come now, you can’t say I’m sentimental,” she added sharply. “Certainly not,” agreed Tommy hastily. “No one would ever think of sentiment in connection with you.” “That’s not very polite,” replied Tuppence. “But I dare say you mean it all right. Well, there it is! I’m ready and willing but I never meet any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.” “What about the general?” inquired Tommy.",0
"His love of order was as great as ever. ""What was the idea in sinking those boats? Are the Big Four a German stunt?"" ""The Big Four are for themselves and for themselves only, M. le Capitaine. Their aim is world domination."" The American burst out laughing, but broke off at the sight of Poirot's serious face. ""You laugh, monsieur,"" said Poirot, shaking a finger at him. ""You reflect not you use not the little gray cells of the brain. Who are these men who send a portion of your navy to destruction simply as a trial of their power? For that was all it was, Monsieur, a test of this new force of magnetical attraction which they hold."" ""Go on with you, moosior,"" said Japp good-humouredly.",0
"His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely mobile, was stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the ordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him. Tuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an actor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his name: Sir James Peel Edgerton. She looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the famous K.C. whose name was familiar all over England. She had heard it said that he might one day be Prime Minister.",0
"There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter.",0
"So matters went on until the end of March, and then one morning Poirot made a remark which startled me considerably. ""This morning, my friend, I should recommend the best suit. We go to call upon the Home Secretary."" ""Indeed? That is very exciting. He has called you in to take up a case?"" ""Not exactly. The interview is of my seeking. You may remember my saying that I once did him some small service? He is inclined to be foolishly enthusiastic over my capabilities in consequence, and I am about to trade on this attitude of his. As you know, the French Premier, M.",0
"I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well ” I felt flustered. “I I assumed it.” “Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, mon petit does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No.",0
"He was now arranging his moustache with exquisite care. “Not so. Voyons! One fact leads to another so we continue. Does the next fit in with that? A merveille! Good! We can proceed. This next little fact no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing a link in the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally, we put it here!” He made an extravagant gesture with his hand.",0
"“Isn’t he a duck?” inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped down the steps. “Oh, Julius, isn’t he just a duck?” “Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was wrong about its being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go right away back to the Ritz?” “I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the park, will you? Unless you’d like to come too?” “I want to get some petrol,” he explained. “And send off a cable or two.” “All right. I’ll meet you at the Ritz at seven. We’ll have to dine upstairs.",0
"In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter. “I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried. Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I most disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was decidedly pretty.… “There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx.",0
"“What terrible voice? Who is it, and what’s the trouble?” “It was the telephone, doctor. I answered it and a voice spoke. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor help. They’ve killed me!’ Then it sort of tailed away. ‘Who’s speaking?’ I said. ‘Who’s speaking?’ Then I got a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘Foscatine’ something like that ‘Regent’s Court.’” The doctor uttered an exclamation. “Count Foscatini. He has a flat in Regent’s Court. I must go at once. What can have happened?” “A patient of yours?” asked Poirot. “I attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian, but he speaks English perfectly.",0
"” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M.",0
"We might have guessed” “Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We hustled all we knew. It’s downright impossible for anyone to get here quicker than we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you reckon there was a dictaphone in Jane’s room? I guess there must have been.” But Tommy’s common sense pointed out objections. “No one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in that house much less that particular room.” “That’s so,” admitted Julius. “Then one of the nurses was a crook and listened at the door.",0
"Pancras. (Boy must have made a mistake. It was King’s Cross, not Charing Cross.) 12.50, that’s the train she went by. 2.10, that’s gone. 3.20 is the next and a damned slow train too.” “What about the car?” Tommy shook his head. “Send it up if you like, but we’d better stick to the train. The great thing is to keep calm.” Julius groaned. “That’s so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in danger!” Tommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking.",0
"“I shut my eyes and think.” Japp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.” “And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?” “Certainly. That’s in the bargain.” “Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. “Like robbing a child!” I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room. “Eh bien!” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?” He shook his finger at me.",0
"Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. He spread it out on the table. “Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial J. or L.?” It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had lain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting Poirot’s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs. Parkson’s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed to “ (the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St. Mary, Essex.",0
"He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course.",0
"I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly.",0
"They looked straight out over the rocky peaks and the long slopes of pine woods leading up to them. Poirot made a gesture towards them. ""It is there?"" he asked in a low voice. ""Yes,"" replied Harvey. ""There is a place called the Felsenlabyrynth all big boulders piled about in a most fantastic way a path winds through them. The quarrying is to the right of that, but we think that the entrance is probably in the Felsenlabyrynth."" Poirot nodded. ""Come, mon ami,"" he said to me. ""Let us go down and sit upon the terrace and enjoy the sunlight."" ""You think that wise?"" I asked. He shrugged his shoulders.",0
"Julius’s narrative style, if not strictly accurate, was picturesque! Slowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they were just coming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct them. His plan was to drive straight up to the house. There Kramenin was to ask for the two girls. Julius explained to him that Little Willie would not be tolerant of failure. Kramenin, by this time, was as putty in the other’s hands. The terrific pace they had come had still further unmanned him. He had given himself up for dead at every corner. The car swept up the drive, and stopped before the porch.",0
"In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case. I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker’s special hobby.",0
"Let us hear what you think?"" Poirot threw me a smile, swelled out his chest, and began in a pompous manner. ""Assuming murder, the question at once arises, why choose that particular method? I can think of only one reason to confuse identity, the face being charred beyond recognition."" ""What?"" I cried. ""You think "" ""A moment's patience, Hastings. I was going on to say that I examine that theory. Is there any ground for believing that the body is not that of Mr. Paynter? Is there any one else whose body it possibly could be? I examine these two questions and finally I answer them both in the negative.",0
"""Ask away,” said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour. “I want to be able to count upon your help.” “I’ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,” she replied gruffly. “Hanging’s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in good old times.” “We are at one then,” said Poirot, “for I, too, want to hang the criminal.” “Alfred Inglethorp?” “Him, or another.” “No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until he came along. I don’t say she wasn’t surrounded by sharks she was. But it was only her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along comes Mr.",0
"Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o’clock hope deserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten. The sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers. Not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full possession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked at the ceiling and wondered vaguely where he was. Then he remembered, and looked at his watch. It was eight o’clock. “It’s either early morning tea or breakfast,” deduced the young man, “and pray God it’s the latter!” The door swung open.",0
"One sometimes manages to put in some work as well.” Something in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook his head with a smile. “No, I shan’t say any more. Great mistake to say too much. Remember that. Never tell all you know not even to the person you know best. Understand? Good-bye.” He strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to understand Sir James’s methods. Once before he had thrown her a hint in the same careless fashion.",0
"I myself, in company with the police, went to the deceased’s room, and whilst there I, apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found that, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all. This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her own room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased’s room when the alarm was given.” I shot a quick glance at Mary.",0
"""Thank you, ma’am.” Tuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the other’s presence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid, horribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes. In the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver, Tuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and went to answer it. This time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris, but a man of striking appearance. Just a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the impression of a big man.",0
"""I do not see that you can fix that definitely unless you question Mademoiselle Dabreuil again.” “There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see nothing, Hastings!” I looked at him for a moment. “Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being in the other’s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.” A faint smile crossed Poirot’s lips.",0
"“You are a clever woman, Rita; but you are also a fool! Be guided by me, and give up Peel Edgerton.” Mrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently. “I think not.” “You refuse?” There was an ugly ring in the Russian’s voice. “I do.” “Then, by Heaven,” snarled the Russian, “we will see ” But Mrs. Vandemeyer also rose to her feet, her eyes flashing. “You forget, Boris,” she said. “I am accountable to no one. I take my orders only from Mr. Brown.” The other threw up his hands in despair. “You are impossible,” he muttered. “Impossible! Already it may be too late.",0
"Maltravers? You did not know, I see, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.” “You mean my story suggested to him oh, but that is awful!” “Do not distress yourself it would have been one way or another. Well, I must get on the telephone to London.” Poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back thoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was not till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off no longer, but must break the news to the young widow.",0
"It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret agreement treaty call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for signature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America at that time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing would have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed.",0
"But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack.",0
"This was the unknown Frenchwoman Number Three of the Big Four. She knelt down beside us and removed the gags, but left us bound, then rising and facing us, with a sudden swift gesture she removed her mask. It was Madame Olivier! ""M. Poirot,"" she said, in a low mocking tone. ""The great, the wonderful, the unique M. Poirot. I sent a warning to you yesterday morning. You chose to disregard it you thought you could pit your wits against US. And now, you are here!"" There was a cold malignity about her that froze me to the marrow. It was so at variance with the burning fire of her eyes.",0
"“I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,” explained Tuppence. “No, there it is! Now you could marry a rich girl.” “I’m like you. I don’t know any.” “That doesn’t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a man in a fur coat come out of the Ritz I can’t rush up to him and say: ‘Look here, you’re rich. I’d like to know you.’” “Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?” “Don’t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that.",0
"Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs, whilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her. I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I could hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one, doubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I stepped briskly down the stairs.",0
"""Exactly,” said Poirot, in an odd voice. “Someone stepped on it.” He rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece, where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening them a trick of his when he was agitated. “Mon ami,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup, grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it contained strychnine or which is far more serious because it did not contain strychnine!” I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good asking him to explain.",0
"From there another door led into the scullery (where the back door was situated), and another into the bedroom which had been occupied by Robert Grant. Having explored the ground, Poirot commented upon it in a low running monologue. ""Here is where the body lay; that big dark stain and the splashes all around mark the spot. Traces of carpet slippers and 'number nine' boots, you observe, but all very confused. Then two sets of tracks leading to and from the kitchen; whoever the murderer was, he came in that way. You have the boot, Hastings? Give it to me."" He compared it carefully with the prints. ""Yes, both made by the same man, Robert Grant.",0
"He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table.",0
"“To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.” I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp. “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.” Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply: “Be exact, my friend.",0
"“Yes,” she said quietly, “I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell you.” “When you are stronger ” “No now!” Her voice rose a little. “I shall feel safer when I have told everything.” “As you please,” said the lawyer. He sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In a low voice Jane began her story. “I came over on the Lusitania to take up a post in Paris. I was fearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or other.",0
"His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question. “What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen, Mr. Ridgeway?” He laughed rather bitterly. “The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.” “But I understood that it had been opened with a key?” “That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t.",0
"Because, after all, honeymoons don’t last forever you’re not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a little wild-cat Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but one day you will suddenly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane, sumptuous furs, Paris frocks, the largest thing in motors and the latest thing in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses! Oh, yes, you will! But have your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and let it be a long one.",0
"“That’s so. We must find him. But after well, I’ve been day-dreaming ever since I started on this trip and these dreams are rotten poor business. I’m quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there’s something I’d like to ask you.” “Yes?” “You and Beresford. What about it?” “I don’t understand you,” replied Tuppence with dignity, adding rather inconsequently: “And, anyway, you’re wrong!” “Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?” “Certainly not,” said Tuppence with warmth. “Tommy and I are friends nothing more.” “I guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another,” observed Julius.",0
"We’re partners I wouldn’t offer you a penny because I liked you, or because you’re a friendless girl what I want is a thrill, and I’m prepared to pay for it. We’re going into this together regardless of expense. To begin with you’ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we’ll plan out our campaign.” We argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn’t like it. I wanted to do the thing on my own. “That’s settled,” said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching herself with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted with my own eloquence.",0
"“Voilà! Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The sergent de ville saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me.",0
"""But why? What are you waiting for?” “For the Olympia. She is due on her return trip from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.” “To a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, mon ami, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I wait eh bien to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is perfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly gifted by the good God the Inspector McNeil, for instance it would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself.",0
"We parted on that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’ “That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died. “I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will.",0
"“Rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “I can tell you, Hastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie you remember Evie?” “No.” “Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She’s the mater’s factotum, companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport old Evie! Not precisely young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.” “You were going to say ?” “Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie’s, though she didn’t seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship.",0
"""This is Captain Harvey, Hastings, one of the most famous members of your Intelligence Service."" ""Not famous at all, I'm afraid,"" said the young man, laughing pleasantly. ""Not famous except to those in the know, I should have said. Most of Captain Harvey's friends and acquaintances consider him an amiable but brainless young man devoted only to the trot of the fox or whatever the dance is called."" We both laughed. ""Well, well, to business,"" said Poirot. ""You are of opinion the time has come, then?"" ""We are sure of it, sir.",0
"“Well,” said Julius, “I guess we’d better make a move out of here any way.” The others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs. Vandemeyer’s pulse. “Perfectly satisfactory,” he said in a low voice to Tuppence. “She’ll be absolutely all right after a night’s rest.” The girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her. “Don’t leave ” she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something that sounded like “sleepy.",0
"However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need.",0
"Later, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what earthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of excitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had retreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities. It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable resemblance to hospital plates! It wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co.",0
"I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, c’est comme ça!” Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?” “Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do either of you ever see Society Gossip?” We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly. “I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it’s really very curious” She broke off.",0
"On one of the outgoing footmarks stained with blood there is superimposed an ingoing one. I wonder what he went back for the little jade figures as an afterthought? It is all ridiculous stupid."" ""Well, he's given himself away pretty hopelessly."" ""N'est-ce pas? I tell you, Hastings, it goes against reason. It offends my little gray cells. Let us go into his bedroom ah, yes; there is the smear of blood on the lintel and just a trace of footmarks the blood-stained. Robert Grant's footmarks, and his only, near the body Robert Grant the only man who went near the house. Yes, it must be so.",0
"Davenheim left the house?” “About half-past five or thereabouts.” “What lies beyond the rose-garden?” “A lake.” “With a boathouse?” “Yes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you’re thinking of suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don’t mind telling you that Miller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged. That’s the kind of man he is!” Poirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “Hastings, I pray you, hand me that copy of the Daily Megaphone. If I remember rightly, there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.” I rose, and found the sheet required.",0
"For one moment his face was a mask of terror. Then, as suddenly, it was impassive again, and repeating his grave disclaimer, he withdrew. Japp departed in search of young Paynter, and Poirot and I were left alone together. ""The Big Four, Hastings,"" cried Poirot. ""Once again, the Big Four. Paynter was a great traveller. In his book there was doubtless some vital information concerning the doings of Number One, Li Chang Yen, the head and brains of the Big Four."" ""But who how "" ""Hush, here they come."" Gerald Paynter was an amiable, rather weak-looking young man.",0
"A lady was just entering the front door as we did so. She ran quickly up the stairs, and I was left with an impression of the heavy mourning that denotes a French widow. ""A most unusual type of woman, that,"" remarked Poirot, as we walked away. ""Madame Olivier? Yes, she "" ""Mais non, not Madame Olivier. Cela va sans dire! There are not many geniuses of her stamp in the world. No, I referred to the other lady the lady on the stairs."" ""I didn't see her face,"" I said, staring. ""And I hardly see how you could have done. She never looked at us."" ""That is why I said she was an unusual type,"" said Poirot placidly.",0
"What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there.",0
"A moment later he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld. “Here is Madame.” Giraud came forward with a curt bow. “This way, madame.” He led her across, and then, standing suddenly aside. “Here is the man. Do you know him?” And as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to read her mind, noting every indication of her manner. But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm too calm, I felt. She looked down at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life.",0
"He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her.",0
"Inglethorp reads it, and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though, unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her mind. She knows that she is in danger but is ignorant of where the danger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down and writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made. She keeps the fatal letter.",0
"She had got in with a bad lot, he told me and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story.",0
"“If the price was big enough.” “A paltry hundred pounds or so!” “No,” said Tuppence. “I should suggest a hundred thousand!” Her economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole million dollars suggested by Julius. A flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer’s face. “What did you say?” she asked, her fingers playing nervously with a brooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the fish was hooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her own money-loving spirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting her. “A hundred thousand pounds,” repeated Tuppence. The light died out of Mrs.",0
"They persisted in regarding the whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so I thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining the paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.” “Short-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here’s all I can do for you. Go on working on this line of yours. If you get anything anything that’s publishable send it along and you shall have your chance. There’s always room for real talent on the Daily Budget. But you’ve got to make good first. See?” I thanked him, and apologized for my methods. “Don’t mention it. I rather like cheek from a pretty girl.",0
"As it was, she positively bridled. “I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The Daily Budget’s out still to catch the man who did it. It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope they’ll get him although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him ah, well, I dare say he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad they’re a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman. Stood there where you’re standing now.",0
"Relate to me in your own words exactly what happened."" The prisoner was a man of medium height, with a somewhat unpleasing cast of features. He looked a jail-bird if ever a man did. ""Honest to God, I never did it,"" he whined. ""Some one put those little glass figures amongst my traps. It was a frame-up, that's what it was. I went straight to my rooms when I came in, like I said. I never knew a thing till Betsy screeched out. S'welp me, God, I didn't."" Poirot rose. ""If you can't tell me the truth, that is the end of it.",0
"They had already arranged their infamous plot that he should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make a will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would probably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim’s money. “They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to be directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a very different dénouement. She arrives from Middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession.",0
"If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order.",0
"Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real rent of those flats is £350. I have just ascertained that from the landlord’s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds! Why?” “There must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as Mrs. Robinson suggested.” Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “Then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!” “But surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.",0
"Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift.",0
"He decided that Tuppence, in the throes of anxiety, had gone to the police, and that his disappearance having been made public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together. The two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his meditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt cramped and stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no hope anywhere. About an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and the door opened. It was Annette. Tommy’s heart beat a little faster. He had forgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had come to his help? Suddenly he heard Conrad’s voice: “Come out of it, Annette. He doesn’t want any supper to-night.” “Oui, oui, je sais bien.",0
"I fixed my mind on my book.” “And that is all you can tell us?” “That is all.” The examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely satisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell more if she chose. Amy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a will form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener at Styles. William Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a document.",0
"It will not be possible again, I fear. But one meeting is essential to define my policy. I can do nothing without Mr. Brown. He is here?” The change in the German’s voice was audible as he replied with slight hesitation: “We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present in person.” He stopped, giving a curious impression of having left the sentence unfinished. A very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked round at a circle of uneasy faces. “Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the dark and trusts no one.",0
"She was more than ever puzzled. “You want me to go to Madame Colombier’s? For how long?” “That depends. Possibly three months.” “And that is all? There are no other conditions?” “None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my ward, and you would hold no communication with your friends. I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being. By the way, you are English, are you not?” “Yes.” “Yet you speak with a slight American accent?” “My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say I picked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.” “On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American.",0
"""Quite right. Savaronoff beat Rubenstein and became Russian champion some years ago. Wilson is said to be a second Capablanca."" ""A very curious occurrence,"" mused Poirot. ""If I mistake not, you have a particular interest in the matter?"" Japp gave a rather embarrassed laugh. ""You've hit it, Moosior Poirot. I'm puzzled. Wilson was sound as a bell no trace of heart trouble. His death is quite inexplicable."" ""You suspect Dr. Savaronoff of putting him out of the way?"" I cried. ""Hardly that,"" said Japp dryly.",0
"“I must have been very drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed. Take my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you, don’t go on the bust again.” “As you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.” “Much wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I haven’t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I said thoughtfully. “She wants to get to Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I’ve a good mind to offer her a temporary job as a secretary.",0
"Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr.",0
"” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if ” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so.",0
""" Then he went out again. The countess came over to us and surveyed my companion attentively for some time. Suddenly she laughed. ""You are very clever, M. Achille Poirot,"" she said mockingly. ""Madame, let us talk business. It is fortunate that they have left us alone together. What is your price?"" ""I do not understand. What price?"" ""Madame, you can aid us to escape. You know the secret ways out of this retreat. I ask you, what is your price?"" She laughed again.",0
"""Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror.",0
"How was I to know?” “Yes,” Tommy chimed in. “How was he to know? Don’t blame the poor fellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all face to face.” He fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group, but the watchful German stilled it with a wave of his hand. “Dead men tell no tales,” he said evenly. “Ah,” said Tommy, “but I’m not dead yet!” “You soon will be, my young friend,” said the German. An assenting murmur came from the others. Tommy’s heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not waver. “I think not,” he said firmly. “I should have a great objection to dying.",0
"I followed him as meekly as the Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn’t carrying a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very difficult to keep up with him. “Harry,” I said at last, in a meek voice, “are we going to walk all the way to Rhodesia?” He turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me up in his arms. “I’m mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.” “We’re a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me, but I’m not making a sacrifice at all! I wanted to come!” That was two years ago. We still live on the island.",0
"There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.",0
"If I have made a mistake” “A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!” He laughed coarsely. “What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police” “Yap, yap, yap like a little toy dog.” He laughed. I sat down on a chair. “I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,” I said coldly. “Indeed?” “I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?” “So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?” Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances.",0
"It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored.",0
"Then came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the company in which he found himself, glad that his daughter was considered to have distinguished herself, but unable to help glancing at her from time to time with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behaved admirably. She forbore to cross her legs, set a guard upon her tongue, and steadfastly refused to smoke. Dr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American Ambassador. “We might as well sit down,” said Julius, when he had introduced all his guests to each other.",0
"The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know.",0
"” Poirot nodded. “Then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in the kitchen. You permit that I mount there?” “Oh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you up and introduce you; but I’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s of any use. They’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and they’ll be all lumped together.” Poirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II. “The order was given from the à la carte menu for three,” he explained.",0
"That’s just the kind of secret he would have a wife and four children. “Have you told this to any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.” I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance. “I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now that you’ve blinking well torn it!” I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in. The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands.",0
"Blair without Colonel Race,” Pagett interposed. “He’s asked her to dine with him, I know.” Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. “Who is Race?” I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. “They say he’s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don’t know for certain.” “Isn’t that like the Government?” I exclaimed. “Here’s a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone.” Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice.",0
" downwards. Mr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner. Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely. “Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you’ll excuse my saying so, you’re a curious young couple. I don’t know you might succeed where others have failed I believe in luck, you know always have” He paused a moment, and then went on. “Well, how about it? You’re out for adventure. How would you like to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know.",0
"Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back.",0
"""Yes, yes. Nevertheless, it is there that we must seek."" He turned to leave the room, but paused with his hand on the door. ""Tell me, madame, do you ever remember your husband mentioning the phrase, 'The Big Four'?"" ""The Big Four,"" she repeated thoughtfully. ""No, I can't say I do."" That was all that could be elicited from Mrs. Halliday. We hurried back to London, and the following day saw us en route for the Continent. With rather a rueful smile, Poirot observed: - ""This Big Four, they make me to bestir myself, mon ami. I run up and down, all over the ground, like our old friend 'the human foxhound.",0
"""You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply.",0
"The meeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!” “What blighter was that?” inquired Tommy.",0
"His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily in the back.” It was my turn to gape and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a doubt crossed my mind. “Poirot,” I cried, “you’re pulling my leg. You’ve heard all about it already.” He turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully. “Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing whatsoever.",0
"""Good Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I’d give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself just for once. You’re so confoundedly conceited!” “Do not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there are times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties of greatness!” The little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that I was forced to laugh. Tuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicions or certainties.",0
"""I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already serious.” “A little fasting will improve my figure,” I said, with a sigh. We were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it with amazement: “Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.” I don’t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne. There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young woman she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She has an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don’t see why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the middle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no train, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel’s wings and flown there.",0
"Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one grain or slightly over. “Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?” asked the Coroner. “I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for domestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions placed on its sale.” “Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison was administered?” “No.” “You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?” “That is so.",0
"The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “Mon Dieu! no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! Eh bien, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.",0
"They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my er experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself.",0
"Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.",0
"But what a lot of things have happened since then especially for you, mon ami!” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning.",0
"” He looked down at the body again. “As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wore gloves.” “You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. “Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared at the doorway. “Monsieur?” “Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago?” “She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.” “Good. I only want one at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared again.",0
"Somebody always talks! “Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. He carried the precious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that particular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing! “The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself passed it on into another’s keeping? There were a few incidents that strengthened the possibility of the latter theory.",0
"“There will be no objection to my er calling in this gentleman, I suppose?” “None at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. “Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just let us have the facts?” Mrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her chair. “Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself.” Thus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began. “I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room as usual” “Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mr. Opalsen explained.",0
"Locks had been forced, and small tables had even been overthrown, so violent had been the searcher's haste. Poirot began to hunt through the débris. Suddenly he stood erect with a cry, holding out something. It was an old fashioned photograph frame empty. He turned it slowly over. Affixed to the back was a small round label a price label. ""It cost four shillings,"" I commented. ""Mon Dieu! Hastings, use your eyes. That is a new clean label.",0
"""Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment. “Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur.",0
"I liked the girl very much, she was so unaffected and so natural. I could see that there was something on her mind, and at last out it came. ""Do you know, Major Neville,"" she said, ""I am really thinking of resigning my post here."" I looked somewhat astonished, and she went on hurriedly. ""Oh! I know it's a wonderful job to have got, in a way. I suppose most people would think me a fool to throw it up. But I can't stand abuse, Major Neville. To be sworn at like a trooper is more than I can bear. No gentleman would do such a thing."" ""Has Ryland been swearing at you?"" She nodded.",0
"Starting with a cheap clothing store, and passing through one or two second-hand establishments, she had finished the day at a well-known hairdresser’s. Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she unwrapped that final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her reflection in the glass. With an actress’s pencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair hair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident that even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not recognize her.",0
"""It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “Dear M.",0
"He's an invalid, as I told you."" ""Many people there to watch it?"" ""At least a dozen probably more."" Poirot made an expressive grimace. ""My poor Japp, your task is not an easy one."" ""Once I know definitely that Wilson was poisoned, I can get on."" ""Has it occurred to you that, in the meantime, supposing your assumption that Savaronoff was the intended victim to be correct, the murderer may try again?"" ""Of course it has. Two men are watching Savaronoff's flat."" ""That will be very useful if any one should call with a bomb under his arm,"" said Poirot dryly. ""You're getting interested, Moosior Poirot,"" said Japp, with a twinkle.",0
"""For Heaven's sake, Poirot,"" I urged, ""let us be up and at them."" ""Admirable, mon ami, admirable! Up where, and at whom? Be precise, I beg of you."" ""At the Big Four, of course."" ""Cela va sans dire. But how would you set about it?"" ""The police,"" I hazarded doubtfully. Poirot smiled. ""They would accuse us of romancing. We have nothing to go upon nothing whatever. We must wait."" ""Wait for what?"" ""Wait for them to make a move. See now, in England you all comprehend and adore la boxe. If one man does not make a move, the other must, and by permitting the adversary to make the attack one learns something about him.",0
"If the others had been there, I should have done just the same.” “Still, as it happens, the others were not there?” “No, but ” “In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple of minutes, and it happened I say, it happened to be during those two minutes that you displayed your ‘natural interest’ in Hydro-chloride of Strychnine?” Lawrence stammered pitiably. “I I ” With a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed: “I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.” This bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court.",0
"What’s he like, this lad?” “Outwardly, he’s an ordinary clean-limbed, rather block-headed young Englishman. Slow in his mental processes. On the other hand, it’s quite impossible to lead him astray through his imagination. He hasn’t got any so he’s difficult to deceive. He worries things out slowly, and once he’s got hold of anything he doesn’t let go. The little lady’s quite different. More intuition and less common sense. They make a pretty pair working together. Pace and stamina.” “He seems confident,” mused the Prime Minister. “Yes, and that’s what gives me hope.",0
"It was just as dusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three days that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any length of time, it would have been thickly coated. Who had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films. I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously.",0
"No sooner were these proceedings completed than Mrs. Pearson appeared, her eyes as round as saucers. ""There's a man here from 'Anwell from the 'Sylum. Did you ever? Shall I show him up?"" We signified assent, and a big burly man in uniform was ushered in. ""'Morning, gentlemen,"" he said cheerfully. ""I've got reason to believe you've got one of my birds here. Escaped last night, he did."" ""He was here,"" said Poirot quietly. ""Not got away again, has he?"" asked the keeper, with some concern. ""He is dead."" The man looked more relieved than otherwise. ""You don't say so.",0
"I have said nothing all these years, I have been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but now matters are different. I want my price and it will be a big, I might almost say a staggering price.” “Extraordinary,” said the Count. “And doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you everywhere?” His eyes roamed gently round the disordered room. Nadina laughed softly. “You need suppose nothing of the sort. I am not a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will dream of looking for them.",0
"Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur.",0
"“I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.” “Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz,” agreed Tommy with a grin. “Where shall we meet? And when?” “Twelve o’clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?” “My time is my own,” replied Mr. Beresford magnificently. “So long, then.” “Good-bye, old thing.” The two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence’s hostel was situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For reasons of economy she did not take a bus. She was half-way across St. James’s Park, when a man’s voice behind her made her start.",0
"""When is the autopsy to take place?"" ""To-night. Wilson's death was extraordinarily sudden. He seemed quite as usual and was actually moving one of the pieces when he suddenly fell forward dead!"" ""There are very few poisons would act in such a fashion,"" objected Poirot. ""I know. The autopsy will help us, I expect. But why should any one want Gilmour Wilson out of the way that's what I'd like to know? Harmless unassuming young fellow. Just come over here from the States, and apparently hadn't an enemy in the world."" ""It seems incredible,"" I mused. ""Not at all,"" said Poirot, smiling.",0
"""Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?” “Several times, I believe.” “He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him?” “Never.” “Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there?” “No.” “Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?” “Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there was a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.",0
"With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent omelette, and an equally excellent entrecôte to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length café noir had completed the meal.",0
"Have you ever seen him before?” Drawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face, Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity. Then she shook her head. “I do not know him.” It seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head. “You are letting her go?” I asked in a low voice. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her head.” “I do not need teaching my business,” said Giraud dryly. “She is under surveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.",0
"All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one. Très bien, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as the Olympia is in, but some one must travel on the Olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery.",0
"We will dismiss the thin air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore” “Yes, but we know” “You may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since it seemed incredible, it was incredible. Two possibilities remain: it was hidden on board also rather difficult or it was thrown overboard.” “With a cork on it, do you mean?” “Without a cork.” I stared. “But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been sold in New York.",0
"Before me, on the rough wooden table, is the letter that Suzanne wrote me. Dear Babes in the Wood Dear Lunatics in Love, I’m not surprised not at all. All the time we’ve been talking Paris and frocks I felt that it wasn’t a bit real that you’d vanish into the blue some day to be married over the tongs in the good old gipsy fashion. But you are a couple of lunatics! This idea of renouncing a vast fortune is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to argue the matter, but I have persuaded him to leave the argument to time. He can administer the estate for Harry and none better.",0
"… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad.",0
"At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find! I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking.",0
"“You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to find one soon, or it’s a washout.” “One more question, permettez Lady Yardly, which plan does she approve?” “Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel.",0
"The spade didn’t come from there, but from the toolshed up by the house.” “Marvellous,” murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. “He has been here but half an hour, and he already knows everything! What a man! Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.” Although I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly impressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help feeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and it vexed me.",0
"” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight. Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head the “Colonel” was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival.",0
"Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I experienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred Inglethorp’s liberality with another woman’s money. Had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser mainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both. On one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or twice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel.",0
"“John,” I said, “I am going to ask you something.” “Well?” “You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here? He has been a most famous detective.” “Yes.” “I want you to let me call him in to investigate this matter.” “What now? Before the post-mortem?” “Yes, time is an advantage if if there has been foul play.” “Rubbish!” cried Lawrence angrily. “In my opinion the whole thing is a mare’s nest of Bauerstein’s! Wilkins hadn’t an idea of such a thing, until Bauerstein put it into his head.",0
"At once.” “Yes, ma’am.” Tuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage. A woman was standing by the fireplace. She was no longer in her first youth, and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and coarsened. In her youth she must have been dazzling. Her pale gold hair, owing a slight assistance to art, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes, of a piercing electric blue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into the very soul of the person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was enhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse.",0
"Your ideas are inclined to be a little crude, Captain Hastings, if I may say so."" ""You devil,"" I said, choking with rage, ""you incarnate devil!"" ""Heated just a trifle heated. Your late lamented friend would have told you that a man who keeps calm has always a great advantage."" ""You dare to speak of him,"" I cried. ""The man you murdered so foully. And you come here "" He interrupted me. ""I came here for an excellent and peaceful purpose. To advise you to return at once to South America. If you do so, that is the end of the matter as far as the Big Four are concerned.",0
"I seemed to see her for a moment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips: “You don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison to me!” “I understand,” I said, “but but don’t do anything rash.” “Oh, rash!” Her voice mocked at my prudence. Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for: “You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?” An instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all expression. “John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.",0
"as practically the middle of the day “and I thought that under the circumstances” He tapped the telegram again. “What is that thing?” I asked. “It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been murdered in your house.” That aroused me in earnest. “What colossal cheek,” I exclaimed. “Why in my house? Who murdered her?” “They don’t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once, Sir Eustace?” “You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?” “The police” “What on earth have I to do with the police?” “Well, it was your house.” “That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.",0
"There isn’t one of them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I’ve protected her as much as I could. Now I’m out of the way, they’ll impose upon her.” “Of course, Miss Howard,” I said, “I’ll do everything I can, but I’m sure you’re excited and overwrought.” She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger. “Young man, trust me. I’ve lived in the world rather longer than you have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You’ll see what I mean.” The throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard rose and moved to the door.",0
"You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man or with himself in a figurative sense might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.” “But not you, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at me. “He couldn’t baffle you, eh, Monsieur Poirot?” Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.",0
"I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, mon ami.” “You are going to Paris? But why?” He replied very seriously. “To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.” “You think he is in Paris?” “I am quite certain that he is not.",0
"“He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly. “You know me?” Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures.",0
"“She’s not in this house, for instance?” “Oh no, monsieur. I must go now they will be waiting for me.” She hurried out. The key turned in the lock. “I wonder who ‘they’ are,” mused Tommy, as he continued to make inroads on the loaf. “With a bit of luck, that girl might help me to get out of here. She doesn’t look like one of the gang.” At one o’clock Annette reappeared with another tray, but this time Conrad accompanied her. “Good morning,” said Tommy amiably. “You have not used Pear’s soap, I see.” Conrad growled threateningly.",0
"” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this.",0
"“So now it can’t be done until to-morrow,” finished Cynthia. “Don’t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?” “Well,” said Cynthia graciously, “we are very busy, but if we have time it shall be done.” The little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the shelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the door. I laughed. “Discipline must be maintained?” “Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside wards there.” I followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different wards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia called to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at her watch. “Nothing more to do, Nibs?” “No.",0
"But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock something would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time.",0
"Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there God knows how long. They’ve blown up the railway line already, I hear. It isn’t even as if one could get a drink there. They put the place under martial law two days ago. “My dear fellow,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that I’m studying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study them from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don’t you worry about me. I shall be all right.",0
"The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all. What do you think, M. le docteur?” “I can only say that it is most abnormal.” “It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed after he was dead.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M.",0
"He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!” I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head.",0
"“What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her.",0
"""That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least ” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M.",0
"I don’t know who the other man is, but the bigger of the two was Whittington.” WHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy started in pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the corner of the street. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them, and by the time he, in his turn, reached the corner the distance between them was sensibly lessened. The small Mayfair streets were comparatively deserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in sight. The sport was a new one to him.",0
"How he could be such a fool beats me!” But Japp was looking attentively at Poirot. “Hold your fire, Summerhaye,” he remarked jocularly. “Me and Moosier here have met before and there’s no man’s judgment I’d sooner take than his. If I’m not greatly mistaken, he’s got something up his sleeve. Isn’t that so, moosier?” Poirot smiled. “I have drawn certain conclusions yes.” Summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his scrutiny of Poirot. “It’s this way,” he said, “so far, we’ve only seen the case from the outside.",0
"Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something something that would happen soon. I was excited restless. After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge. It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls their elusive quality.",0
"“Chéri,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.” “Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack I am afraid.” I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man’s arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers.",0
"This explains all the ease with which they surrendered Halliday everything. Madame Olivier was the ruling spirit -Vera Rossakoff only her lieutenant. Madame needed Halliday's ideas she herself had the necessary genius to supply the gaps that perplexed him. Yes, Hastings, we know now who Number Three is the woman who is probably the greatest scientist in the world! Think of it. The brain of the East, the science of the West and two others whose identities we do not yet know. But we must find out. To-morrow we will return to London and set about it.",0
"Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them.",0
"His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do. I don’t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise. There’s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you’re a sensible young woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him” “I won’t do anything of the kind.",0
"And, if they were already straightened, there would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the meantime, someone else had touched them.” “Dear me,” I murmured, “so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still there?” “Yes, and it was a race for time.” “But I still can’t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.” “Ah, but he had no opportunity. I saw to that.” “You?” “Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my confidence on the subject?” “Yes.",0
"We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.",0
"“I don’t see how they could. And yet she is on the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and she dies. Is it only chance?” “But how ” “Yes, how! That is what we must find out.” He stood there silently, gently stroking his chin. “We must find out,” he said quietly, and Tuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of those simple words. Julius’s glance went to the window. “The window’s open,” he remarked. “Do you think ” Tuppence shook her head. “The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were there.” “He might have slipped out ” suggested Julius. But Sir James interrupted him.",0
"Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.” I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly: “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!” I looked at him coldly. On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress.",0
"He is the leading authority on the subject, and I was to get from him whether the thing suggested was anyway possible."" ""And was it?"" I asked eagerly. ""That's just what I don't know. I haven't seen Mr. Halliday and I'm not likely to, by all accounts."" ""The truth of the matter is,"" said Japp, shortly, ""Halliday's disappeared."" ""When?"" ""Two months ago."" ""Was his disappearance reported?"" ""Of course it was. His wife came to us in a great state. We did what we could, but I knew all along it would be no good."" ""Why not?"" ""Never is when a man disappears that way."" Japp winked.",0
"Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wrist watch which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.",0
"A bad night but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.” “You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health.",0
"“I’ve come to report, sir. I’ve failed failed badly.” Mr. Carter eyed him sharply. “You mean that the treaty ” “Is in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir.” “Ah!” said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did not change, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes. It convinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless. “Well,” said Mr. Carter after a minute or two, “we mustn’t sag at the knees, I suppose. I’m glad to know definitely. We must do what we can.” Through Tommy’s mind flashed the assurance: “It’s hopeless, and he knows it’s hopeless!” The other looked up at him.",0
"Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen? Would he have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so providentially upon the scene?” “Then you think he may be entirely innocent?” “It looks like it, but, if so, we’ve got to find out what he was doing in Marlow. If he’s got a reasonable explanation of that, we’re on the right tack.” He got up. “It’s past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before dawn I’ll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at Livingstone. I’ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away until the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira train there.",0
"There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells. I will impart it to you ” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, ne vous impatientez pas! I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology.",0
"""Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.” As we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than once. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his eyes turned green like a cat’s. They were shining like emeralds now. “My friend,” he broke out at last, “I have a little idea, a very strange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet it fits in.” I shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth was only too plain and apparent.",0
"I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I sprang up. Harry was on the stoep outside. “Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.” I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing.",0
"Not till I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the ridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe freely once more. No arrest had been made, and I realized that it was a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined Suzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the hotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson. It was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought of Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the sure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight.",0
"“Sir James,” said Tuppence, plunging boldly, “I dare say you will think it is most awful cheek of me coming here like this. Because, of course, it’s nothing whatever to do with you, and then you’re a very important person, and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant.” She paused for breath. “Tommy?” queried Sir James, looking across at the American. “No, that’s Julius,” explained Tuppence. “I’m rather nervous, and that makes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is what you meant by what you said to me the other day? Did you mean to warn me against Mrs.",0
"Leave no message for your friend or she will suffer."" It was signed with a big 4. What ought I to have done? What would you who read have done in my place? I had no time to think. I saw only one thing Cinderella in the power of those devils. I must obey I dare not risk a hair of her head. I must go with this Chinaman and follow whither he led. It was a trap, yes, and it meant certain capture and possible death, but it was baited with the person dearest to me in the whole world, and I dared not hesitate. What irked me most was to leave no word for Poirot.",0
"He still seemed to be thinking. “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.” “But the maid did!” “Why do you say that?” “Why,” I stammered, “they were found actually in her mattress.” “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.",0
"I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved.",0
"“Will your business take long to state?” “Might be an all night job if you caught on.” “Very good, Ivan. I shall not require you again this evening. Go to the theatre take a night off.” “Thank you, your excellency.” The secretary bowed and departed. Julius stood at the door watching his retreat. Finally, with a satisfied sigh, he closed it, and came back to his position in the centre of the room. “Now, Mr. Hersheimmer, perhaps you will be so kind as to come to the point?” “I guess that won’t take a minute,” drawled Julius.",0
"“That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard Jimmy Japp. The other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my friend.” I stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the policeman about them. I should never have suspected them of being official personages. I was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict being given: “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.” As we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle pressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the Scotland Yard men.",0
"Now, madame, recount to me exactly, in detail, and as methodically as you can, the exact circumstances of your husband's disappearance."" ""My husband went to Paris on Thursday, the 20th of July. He was to meet and visit various people there connected with his work, amongst them Madame Olivier."" Poirot nodded at the mention of the famous French woman chemist, who had eclipsed even Madame Curie in the brilliance of her achievements. She had been decorated by the French Government, and was one of the most prominent personalities of the day.",0
"I may as well tell you in confidence, Sir Eustace that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by the secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady. Where and how did you come to engage her?” “She was lent to me,” I replied coldly, “by your own Government.” He collapsed utterly. (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) As soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne. She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off en route.",0
"You accompany me, n’est-ce pas?” “Well ” “You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.” “Oh, that’s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.” “Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the name?” “There’s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name’s Renauld. I don’t know whether it could be the same.” “But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is in Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress finely.” “Dear me, Poirot,” I said, my excitement rising, “I smell some goodly shekels in this.",0
"""Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?” Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned. Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand. “Again, if you please, mademoiselle.” At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket. “Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,” he bowed to the inspector “for your courtesy.",0
"Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free but in order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation. And then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was.",0
"Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession, there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.” “Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!” cried Mrs. Inglethorp. “It makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there’s Cynthia!” A young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn. “Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings Miss Murdoch.” Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D.",0
"I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there. I had nearly reached the place when ” He paused and swallowed. “Yes?” “I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud a sort of choke and gasp but it frightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came round the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then and then I looked up and saw her.",0
"A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him.",0
"“Miss Beddingfeld, you may not know it, but you are mixed up in a rather dangerous business.” “I gathered as much,” I said. “No, you don’t. You can’t possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave the whole thing alone. It can’t concern you really. Don’t let your curiosity lead you to tamper with other people’s business. No, please don’t get angry again. I’m not speaking of myself. You’ve no idea of what you might come up against these men will stop at nothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you’re in danger look at last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is to persuade them that they’re mistaken.",0
"He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself it’s something about the eyes.” “I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.",0
"Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection. “Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.",0
"” For answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket an ancient tattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans. Then, wheeling round, he strode out of the tent. The doctor stared at me. “What is his little idea?” The phrase, so familiar on Poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came from another. “I don’t know exactly,” I confessed. “He’s got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.” I went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced young man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner’s secretary. “No,” Mr.",0
"My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A a fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs.",0
"Indeed, had it not been for his little trick with the bread, of which he was evidently quite unaware, I would have sworn readily enough that the man sitting there was some one whom I had never seen before. ""He has recognised you,"" I murmured. ""You should not have come down."" ""My excellent Hastings, I have feigned death for three months for this one purpose."" ""To startle Number Four?"" ""To startle him at a moment when he must act quickly or not at all. And we have this great advantage he does not know that we recognise him. He thinks that he is safe in his new disguise. How I bless Flossie Monro for telling us of that little habit of his.",0
"To begin with, Black answered well within the normal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘Day’ to ‘Night’ and ‘Place’ to ‘Name’ are normal associations. I began work with ‘Bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all. Evidently he had not.",0
"Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “Pardon M. Hautet,” I cried, “but will you permit me to ask him one question?” “But certainly, monsieur.” Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. “Where do you keep your boots?” “Sac à papier!” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?” “But when you go to bed at night?” “Under my bed.” “But who cleans them?” “Nobody.",0
"“Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?” “Do I know me? A man a stranger. They found him up there in the shed not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed stabbed to the heart with the same dagger!” Waiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me.",0
"” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.",0
"Who is he? Nobody knows. What does he look like? Again nobody knows. How many times have we seen him, you and I? Five times, is it not? And could either of us say truthfully that we could be sure of recognising him again?"" I was forced to shake my head, as I ran back in my mind over those five different people who, incredible as it seemed, were one and the same man. The burly lunatic asylum keeper, the man in the buttoned up overcoat in Paris, James, the footman, the quiet young medical man in the Yellow Jasmine case, and the Russian Professor. In no way did any two of these people resemble each other. ""No,"" I said hopelessly.",0
"He saw me as a child, and not since till I came to live with him here in London. But this much I do know, he is in fear of something. We have many secret societies in Russia, and one day I overheard something which made me think it was of just such a society he went in fear. Tell me, monsieur"" she came a step nearer, and dropped her voice ""have you ever heard of a society called the 'Big Four'?"" Poirot jumped nearly out of his skin. His eyes positively bulged with astonishment.",0
"Inglethorp’s voice you heard?” “Oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?” “Well, what happened next?” “Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o’clock, Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea nothing to eat to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful so white and upset. ‘Dorcas,’ she says, ‘I’ve had a great shock.’ ‘I’m sorry for that, m’m,’ I says. ‘You’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea, m’m.’ She had something in her hand.",0
"The house was surrounded by police who, if they failed to reappear, would not hesitate to break in and make a thorough search. She smiled at her own foolishness then looked up with a start to find Sir James watching her. He gave her an emphatic little nod. “Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does Miss Finn.” “Yes,” admitted Jane. “It’s absurd but I can’t help it.” Sir James nodded again. “You feel as we all feel the presence of Mr. Bown. Yes” as Tuppence made a movement “not a doubt of it Mr.",0
"“My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I believe,” he said. Poirot drew out the small bunch of keys. “Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.” “But it’s not locked now.” “Impossible!” “See.” And John lifted the lid as he spoke. “Milles tonnerres!” cried Poirot, dumbfounded. “And I who have both the keys in my pocket!” He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he stiffened. “Eh voilà une affaire! This lock has been forced.” “What?” Poirot laid down the case again.",0
"At last he called me: “Come, Anne, it’s time to go.” I got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I knew that dawn was not far off. “We’ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat” Harry began, when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand. “Hush! What’s that?” I listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the wilderness. Presently I heard it too the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.",0
"I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed.",0
"Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.",0
"“Tommy!” “Yes?” “What were they like, the two men you passed?” Tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance. “One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think and dark.” “That’s him,” cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. “That’s Whittington! What was the other man like?” “I can’t remember. I didn’t notice him particularly. It was really the outlandish name that caught my attention.” “And people say that coincidences don’t happen!” Tuppence tackled her Pêche Melba happily. But Tommy had become serious.",0
"The sunlight was marvellous in fact the glare was almost too great for me. We had some creamy coffee instead of tea, then went upstairs and unpacked our few belongings. Poirot was in his most unapproachable mood, lost in a kind of reverie. Once or twice he shook his head and sighed. I had been rather intrigued by a man who had got out of our train at Bolzano, and had been met by a private car. He was a small man, and the thing about him that had attracted my attention was that he was almost as much muffled up as Poirot had been. More so, indeed, for in addition to greatcoat and muffler, he was wearing huge blue spectacles.",0
"She is a true daughter of France, and devoted solely to the cause of science."" Poirot shrugged his shoulders and did not answer. There was a minute or two's pause, and then my little friend rose to his feet, with an air of dignity that sat rather oddly upon his quaint personality. ""That is all I have to say, messieurs to warn you. I thought it likely that I should not be believed. But at least you will be on your guard. My words will sink in, and each fresh event that comes along will confirm your wavering faith. It was necessary for me to speak now later I might not have been able to do so.",0
"He could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness. A repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and Tommy, his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and cautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from sight. There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which afforded him a good view.",0
"Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.” “Who is his uncle?” “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.” “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?” “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds.",0
"“Look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to London?” “You think so, Hastings? Why?” “Well” I coughed delicately “things haven’t gone very well, have they? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose!” “True,” said Poirot, rather crestfallen. “It was not one of my most striking triumphs.” This way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I stuck to my guns.",0
"And then I started, for our invalid, roused suddenly from his stupor, sat up in his chair and said clearly and distinctly: ""Li Chang Yen."" He had the look of a man suddenly awakened from sleep. Poirot made a sign to me not to speak. The man went on. He spoke in a clear, high voice, and something in his enunciation made me feel that he was quoting from some written report or lecture. ""Li Chang Yen may be regarded as representing the brains of the Big Four. He is the controlling and motive force. I have designated him, therefore, as Number One. Number Two is seldom mentioned by name.",0
"It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look at the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will realize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives. He knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over, vengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me to the real Mrs. Robinson that delightful and truthful creature! What will they think when they find their flat has been broken into! We must hurry back.",0
"But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared. The police are looking for her.” “Was she in with her daughter, do you think?” “We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.” “Has Jack Renauld been told?” “Not yet.” “It will be a terrible shock to him.” “Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.",0
"Had bad nervous breakdown as the result of a motor accident three and a half years ago, and has not appeared on the stage since. No clue to his present whereabouts. Age 35, height 5 ft. 9-1/2 in., complexion fair, eyes blue, hair brown. ""Claud Darrell. Supposed to be real name. Some mystery about his origin. Played at music halls, and also in Repertory plays. Seems to have had no intimate friends. Was in China in 1919. Returned by way of America. Played a few parts in New York. Did not appear on the stage one night, and has never been heard of since.",0
"It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young men with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks. Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things.",0
"""What about the old woman?"" I said suddenly. ""She was in the house alone after Grant had gone for the milk. She might have killed him and then gone out. Her feet would leave no prints if she hadn't been outside."" ""Very good, Hastings. I wondered whether that hypothesis would occur to you. I had already thought of it and rejected it. Betsy Andrews is a local woman, well-known hereabouts. She can have no connection with the Big Four; and, besides, old Whalley was a powerful fellow, by all accounts. This is a man's work not a woman's.",0
"“Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again will I vaunt my little grey cells!” “That’s a good job at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this all about?” As usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely no attention to me. “The tradesmen’s books I have left them entirely out of account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at once.” Easier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter, and there Poirot hired a car.",0
"I learnt afterwards that they nearly did away with me then and there there was never much chance of their ‘letting me go’ but the first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep me alive on the chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell where if I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks. Sometimes they’d ask me questions by the hour I guess there was nothing they didn’t know about the third degree! but somehow I managed to hold my own. The strain of it was awful, though “They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the journey again, in case I’d hidden it somewhere en route.",0
"With the assistance of Gerald Paynter and the Chinaman that was soon broken in, but a terrible sight greeted them. Mr. Paynter had fallen forward into the gas fire, and his face and head were charred beyond recognition. ""Of course, at the moment, no suspicion was aroused as to its being anything but a ghastly accident. If blame attached to any one, it was to Doctor Quentin for giving his patient a narcotic and leaving him in such a dangerous position. And then a rather curious discovery was made. ""There was a newspaper on the floor, lying where it had slipped from the old man's knees.",0
"“Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady, richly dressed fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming along slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl, gesticulating as he does so.",0
"So we are forced to the second that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “Bien! Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but ” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love.” I shook my head perplexed. “Mais, oui, you know perfectly.",0
"Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age. Aha! a note from Japp.” “Yes?” pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case. “He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted to have been of service to him.” “How does he thank you?” I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp. “He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.",0
"I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were kindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In fact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned. I thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and far off. I yawned again. Probably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a bad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had murdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet.",0
"It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling.",0
"I saw the latter spring back, his arm raised, then suddenly a dense volume of smoke was rising round me, choking me killing me I felt myself falling suffocating this was death * * * * * I came to myself slowly and painfully all my senses dazed. The first thing I saw was Poirot's face. He was sitting opposite me watching me with an anxious face. He gave a cry of joy when he saw me looking at him. ""Ah, you revive you return to yourself. All is well! My friend my poor friend!"" ""Where am I?"" I said painfully. ""Where? But chez vous!"" I looked round me. True enough, I was in the old familiar surroundings.",0
"By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a desperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted that I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions and failed!” “What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle.",0
"“I was.” As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. “You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?” “M. Poirot has gone to Paris,” I replied coldly. “And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.” “Bah! The English police!” Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. “They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better.",0
"I was convinced that here we had an emissary of the Big Four. Poirot did not seem very impressed by my idea, but when, leaning out of my bedroom window, I reported that the man in question was strolling about in the vicinity of the hotel, he admitted that there might be something in it. I urged my friend not to go down to dinner, but he insisted on doing so. We entered the dining-room rather late, and were shown to a table by the window. As we sat down, our attention was attracted by an exclamation and a crash of falling china. A dish of haricots verts had been upset over a man who was sitting at the table next to ours. The head waiter came up and was vociferous in apologies.",0
"All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me little better than a limp rag. I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious of some barrier between us a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing.",0
"” The gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed of her attack of “nerves.” “Say,” remarked Julius suddenly, “there’s Tuppence’s bright boy. I guess I’d better go down and ease his young mind. That’s some lad, Tuppence.” “How did you get in, by the way?” asked Tuppence suddenly. “I forgot to ask.” “Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was just a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He’d been listening outside the door of the flat, but couldn’t hear anything.",0
"But, all the same, it is possible that he is among us now” He looked round him again, and again that expression of fear swept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully. The Russian tapped his cheek. “So be it. Let us proceed.” The German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the place he had been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian demurred, but the other insisted. “It is the only possible place,” he said, “for Number One.",0
"Our conversation was incoherent and inconsequent. Ejaculations, eager questions, incomplete answers, messages from my wife, explanations as to my journey, were all jumbled up together. ""I suppose there's some one in my old rooms?"" I asked at last, when we had calmed down somewhat. ""I'd love to put up here again with you."" Poirot's face changed with startling suddenness. ""Mon Dieu! but what a chance épouvantable. Regard around you, my friend."" For the first time I took note of my surroundings. Against the wall stood a vast ark of a trunk of prehistoric design.",0
"In a moment or two he roused himself, and went on with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one, very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own pocket. “I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be done at once!” He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash-stand.",0
"30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!” “Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?” Japp winked. “I think it grew pretty fast grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that we’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I’m sorry Mrs.",0
"“The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “Bien,” said Bex.",0
"Owing to the fact that an itinerary of the great man’s daily proceedings had just been published, I knew exactly where to find him at this moment. It was his hour for dictating to his secretary in his own house. I did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to come and ask for him would be at once admitted to the august presence. But I had attended to that side of the matter. In the card-tray in the hall of the Flemmings’ house I had observed the card of the Marquis of Loamsley, England’s most famous sporting peer. I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs, and pencilled upon it the words: “Please give Miss Beddingfeld a few moments of your time.",0
"True, he would sometimes investigate cases which intrigued him, but he usually dropped them the moment he was convinced that they had no connection with the activities of the Big Four. This attitude of his was remarkably profitable to our friend, Inspector Japp. Undeniably he gained much kudos for solving several problems in which his success was really due to a half-contemptuous hint from Poirot.",0
"For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch.",0
"“Why?” “Monsieur has not heard the news, though?” “What news?” “That there has been another murder there last night!” “What?” Leaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could. Another murder and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise. “What has happened?” “Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?” She crossed herself.",0
"""But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.” “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door.",0
"At last Lady Yardly rose. “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.” She hesitated, her hand outstretched. “Captain Hastings.” “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.” When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.",0
"Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! mon Dieu! What else could it be?” “Blackmail,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor.",0
"My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I can’t resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it gives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn’t quite as clever as he thought himself, was he? I think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I’m sending you my diary. There’s nothing in it that would interest Race and his crowd, but I fancy that there are passages in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for the Daily Budget, “Criminals I have met.” I only stipulate that I shall be the central figure.",0
"A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last.",0
"I start for Hoppaton à l'heure même."" ""Dear me, this is very interesting. Supposing I come along too? Any objection?"" ""I should be charmed to have your company, but we must start at once. We shall not reach Dartmoor until close on nightfall, as it is."" John Ingles did not delay us more than a couple of minutes, and soon we were in the train moving out of Paddington bound for the West Country. Hoppaton was a small village clustering in a hollow right on the fringe of the moorland. It was reached by a nine-mile drive from Moretonhamstead.",0
"Renauld’s youth and upbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?” “All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.” “What is it, my friend?” “Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!” “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot placidly, “that is just what he did do!” In a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition.",0
"To play on the weaknesses of human nature, then on the weaknesses of nations to get together and control a vast organization, and finally to overthrow the existing order, and rule! The thought intoxicated me “ I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is bound to attract notice. I must have a successful career which would mask my true activities Also I must cultivate a personality. I modelled myself upon famous K.C.’s. I reproduced their mannerisms, their magnetism.",0
"” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening. The show was wearisome beyond words or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so.",0
"Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him.",0
"“Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?” “I’ve got an old uncle who’s more or less rolling, but he’s no good.” “Why not?” “Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.” “I think I remember hearing about it,” said Tuppence slowly. “You refused because of your mother ” Tommy flushed. “Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was all she had. Old boy hated her wanted to get me away from her. Just a bit of spite.” “Your mother’s dead, isn’t she?” said Tuppence gently. Tommy nodded. Tuppence’s large grey eyes looked misty.",0
"“Yes, I do feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.",0
"“What on earth does this mean?” I asked, surprised. It was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the salute rather impaired the pleasure. “It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike her as much as she thought,” replied Poirot philosophically. “But ” “Here he is.” Lawrence at that moment passed the door. “Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,” called Poirot. “We must congratulate you, is it not so?” Lawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry spectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming. I sighed. “What is it, mon ami?” “Nothing,” I said sadly.",0
"No, Anne, don’t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down here. Joking apart, I think you’ve made a very important discovery. Up till now, we’ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we know he hasn’t.” “Exactly,” I said. “We must keep an eye on him.” “As well as everybody else,” she said ruefully. “Well, that’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. That and finance. No, don’t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you’ve got to listen to horse sense over this.",0
"“Mon Dieu! But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when ” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.” “You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then ” “Eh bien?” “Well, we are hunting together again, and ” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, mon ami, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil.",0
"She was very silent, hardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the great strength of her personality was dominating us all. And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I thought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly: “Yes, I’ve got the most beastly headache.” “Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?” said Poirot solicitously. “It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the mal de tête.” He jumped up and took her cup.",0
"When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa. I have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at last the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins me to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by his master’s side.",0
"“In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we get what?” “Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.” “Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.” “I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed. “You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll test his alibi?” “Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.” “You think he has an alibi?” “That is just what worries me.",0
"You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her.",0
"""Incredible,"" muttered the Frenchman. ""Ryland, mixed up with a thing of that kind? Surely the idea is too fantastic."" ""Listen, monsieur, whilst I recount to you some of the doings of this Big Four."" It was an enthralling narrative which Poirot unfolded. Familiar as I was with all the details, they thrilled me anew as I heard the bald recital of our adventures and escapes. M. Desjardeaux looked mutely at Mr. Crowther as Poirot finished. The other answered the look. ""Yes, M. Desjardeaux, I think we must admit the existence of a 'Big Four.' Scotland Yard was inclined to jeer at first, but they have been forced to admit that M.",0
"“Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I’m ever going to find Jane?” Julius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to him that Tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He nodded. “That’s so. I’m getting down and out over the business. Sir James to-day hadn’t got any hope at all, I could see that.",0
"I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind.",0
"You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “Eh bien, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d hounds to the hounds.",0
"No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",0
"I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out. “Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the affair at the Villa Geneviève?’ “Yes,” I said eagerly.",0
"An interesting case, a very interesting case. Not so uncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very well known parallels. It’s the first case of the kind that I’ve had under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I’ve found it of absorbing interest.” There was something rather ghoulish in the little man’s satisfaction. “And she remembers nothing,” said Sir James slowly. “Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as good as yours or mine.” “Then the first thing she remembers?” “Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank.",0
"Cynthia, whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the opening of a new and hopeful future. The papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines, sandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle innuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue. Nothing was spared us. It was a slack time.",0
"Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I’m tired of secretaries, I won’t have any more secretaries. Either they’re concealed murderers or else they’re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have.",0
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr.",0
"Always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man and a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case? I will tell you it does not fit in, and so we shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of working? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy balloon swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he despises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon comme ça!” And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he resumed: “Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak.",0
"It’s their business, not mine. I don’t know anything about the coffee-cups, except that we’ve got some that are never used, which are a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You’re not a connoisseur, are you, Hastings?” I shook my head. “You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china it’s pure delight to handle it, or even to look at it.” “Well, what am I to tell Poirot?” “Tell him I don’t know what he’s talking about. It’s double Dutch to me.” “All right.” I was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me back.",0
"The curtains and portière were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward, passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, mon ami! And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief.",0
"I was scared the woman would catch sight of me, for I was full in the moonlight. I tried to move back a bit. The jerk I gave was too much for that rotten old branch. With an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius P. Hersheimmer with it!” “Oh, Julius,” breathed Tuppence, “how exciting! Go on.” “Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of earth but it put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The next thing I knew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not Whittington’s one) on one side of me, and a little black-bearded man with gold glasses, and medical man written all over him, on the other.",0
"Zia, I think. But I don't suppose that that had any bearing on the rest of it."" ""You would not suppose so, Hastings. Cara Zia is very important, very important indeed."" ""I don't see "" ""My dear friend, you never see and anyway the English know no geography."" ""Geography?"" I cried. ""What has geography got to do with it?"" ""I dare say M. Thomas Cook would be more to the point."" As usual, Poirot refused to say anything more a most irritating trick of his. But I noticed that his manner became extremely cheerful, as though he had scored some point or other. The days went on, pleasant if a trifle monotonous.",0
"Carter turns purple in the face and gasps out: ‘How much?’ Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you in the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the performance.” “Don’t be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is from the Ritz!” “A hundred pounds instead of fifty!” “I’ll read it: “DEAR SIR, “Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round somewhere about lunch-time. “Yours truly, “JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.” “Ha!” said Tommy.",0
"It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race’s men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.” Sir Eustace turned suddenly. “Very clever. Very creditable. But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you. You’ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that’s all you’ve got against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her and your record’s against you.",0
"It was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves against the wall. I heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. Then he flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear: “Allez.” We sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his arms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless.",0
"A woman nearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may be deceived!” “Billy Kellett? But he’s known to the police!” “Did I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his alibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn he was creating the character of Billy Kellett, ‘doing three months,’ so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came. He was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty. It was worth while doing the thing thoroughly.",0
"“Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station.” “Oh, no, thank you,” I said hastily. “Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered.” To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!” “What has he done now?” I inquired with some curiosity. “He’s got hold of a secretary for me.",0
"” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M.",0
"” Tuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then said softly: “I shouldn’t like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.” “So we come to the usual question how much?” Tuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington with complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain. “Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?” Whittington gave her an ugly glance. “Blackmail, eh?” Tuppence smiled sweetly. “Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?” Whittington grunted.",0
"Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure. “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew.",0
"That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes.…” His voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start.” “You’ve oceans of time.” “Perhaps perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.” “At all events,” I said, rising, “I will come and see you off.” “You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.” He was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded emphatically. “I mean it, mon ami. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it is not the English custom.",0
"Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly.",0
"Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs.",0
"In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell. My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned. “Here you are and here you stay,” he remarked facetiously. I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. “I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.",0
"Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?” “But how on earth could you know all that?” “I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the little grey cells! They told me. Thus, and in no other way, could there have been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. Poirot listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious.",0
"Renauld’s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to take them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame Renauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart. That night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then, taking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground where he knows a how do you call it? bunkair? is to be made. It is essential that the body should be found Madame Daubreuil must have no suspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as to identity will be greatly lessened. Then, M.",0
"” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind ” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?” “Well, I’d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he’s anywhere about, and see what he’s up to.” “The human foxhound,” murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a comfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “By all means, my friend. Au revoir.” I strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the path we had taken the day before.",0
"""Very well.” He rang the bell. Dorcas answered it in due course. “Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.” “Yes, sir.” Dorcas withdrew. We waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his ease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase. The clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the approach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter nodded. “Come inside, Manning,” said John, “I want to speak to you.” Manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and stood as near it as he could.",0
"Pas si mal!"" ""I'm with you, as you know,"" said Ingles. ""By the way, I'm going out to China as soon as I can get off."" ""Is that wise?"" ""No,"" said Ingles dryly. ""But it's necessary. One must do what one can."" ""Ah, you are a brave man!"" cried Poirot with emotion. ""If we were not in the street, I would embrace you."" I fancied that Ingles looked rather relieved. ""I don't suppose that I shall be in any more danger in China than you are in London,"" he growled. ""That is possibly true enough,"" admitted Poirot. ""I hope that they will not succeed in massacring Hastings also, that is all. That would annoy me greatly.",0
"You, Hastings, will remain here yes, I pray of you. In verity, my friend, I am serious."" I believed him, but it was not likely that I should consent to being left behind in that fashion. Our argument was short but decisive. It was not until we were in the train, speeding towards Paris that he admitted that he was secretly glad of my decision. ""For you have a part to play, Hastings. An important part! Without you, I might well fail. Nevertheless, I felt that it was my duty to urge you to remain behind."" ""There is danger, then?"" ""Mon ami, where there is the Big Four there is always danger.",0
"""But I demand pardon if I am dense, madame surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?” A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older. “I want to wear it down there.” “Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?” “That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly.",0
"I did not like to ask Poirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings. We alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something sharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the steps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously. A light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was opened cautiously a little way.",0
"Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P.",0
"” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime.",0
"She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him. She is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow.",0
"Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open. “You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes though not always then and it is against that that we are going to make provision.” He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes.",0
"“It is significant! It is tremendous!” “Y es ” “Ah!” Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed before it. “Beware! Peril to the detective who says: ‘It is so small it does not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.’ That way lies confusion! Everything matters.” “I know. You always told me that. That’s why I have gone into all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.” “And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given me the facts faithfully.",0
"Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and revised most of Papa’s Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors, Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote ages. I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject, probably not, and in any case he would not have been interested. The opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest degree. I think it was really a sign of his greatness. In the same way, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life.",0
"""I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I can assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.” “I hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me, Sir Eustace.” “Recognized you where?” “At Marlow, Sir Eustace?” “At Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?” “I thought you understood that” “I’m beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning of the story and start again. You went to Florence” “Then you don’t know after all and you didn’t recognize me!” “As far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away needlessly made a coward of by your conscience.",0
"Up to modern times armed force was necessary for conquest, but in this century of unrest a man like Li Chang Yen can use other means. I have evidence that he has unlimited money behind him for bribery and propaganda, and there are signs that he controls some scientific force more powerful than the world has dreamed of."" Poirot was following Mr. Ingles's words with the closest attention. ""And in China?"" he asked. ""He moves there too?"" The other nodded in emphatic assent.",0
"Further questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of the morning, and the circumstances of his mother’s death. The medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and every eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology. In a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn of its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact that Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine poisoning.",0
"In the centre of the page was his portrait. “So that’s who Number 1 is,” said Tommy with his mouth full of eggs and bacon. “Not a doubt about it, I must push on.” He paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There he sent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few minutes later he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name of “Mr. Carter.” There was a frown on his face. “Look here, you’ve no business to come asking for me in this way. I thought that was distinctly understood?” “It was, sir.",0
"I am convinced that the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if you will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several years of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee.",0
"I don’t hold with foreigners as a rule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave Belges isn’t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he’s a most polite spoken gentleman.” Dear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to mine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned servant that is so fast dying out. I thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up Poirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once gave him Dorcas’s message.",0
"“It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Grünberg at Marlow and that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s business was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate. No the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt to put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town by no possible means could he have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town.",0
"I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face. I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board.",0
"You remember her once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she dispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she occasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs.",0
"But there are different kinds of fishing. I’ve a good mind to stay, and see if we can’t get on the track of that young chap.” “Oh!” Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically. “All the same, as I said before, it’s too bad of of Carter to set you two babies on a job like this. Now, don’t get offended, Miss er ” “Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence.” “Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as I’m certainly going to be a friend. Don’t be offended because I think you’re young. Youth is a failing only too easily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy of yours ” “Yes.” Tuppence clasped her hands. “Frankly, things look bad for him.",0
"Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe?” Dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question. “No, sir.” “Are you quite sure?” “Oh, yes, sir.” “Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?” Dorcas reflected. “Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.” “Light or dark green?” “A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.” “Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?” “No, sir not that I know of.” Poirot’s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or otherwise.",0
"I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?” I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs.",0
"""English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.",0
"Therefore, we must find him.” “Yes, but how?” cried Tuppence. “I’ve tried to think of everything.” Sir James smiled. “And yet there’s one person quite near at hand who in all probability knows where he is, or at all events where he is likely to be.” “Who is that?” asked Tuppence, puzzled. “Mrs. Vandemeyer.” “Yes, but she’d never tell us.” “Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I shall be able to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to know.” “How?” demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.",0
"My maid remains in the room till I come up, so there’s no need.” The inspector’s face grew graver. “Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then the maid has not left the room?” Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French.",0
"Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.” She stopped.",0
"She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise. From hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of uniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients. “Yes,” said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the glass, “you’ll do.” She then resumed her normal appearance. Dinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommy’s non-return. Julius, too, was absent but that to the girl’s mind was more easily explained.",0
"But for the restraining hand of the other man I should have gone down the yawning gap beneath me. It was inky black, and I could hear the rushing of water. ""The river,"" said my questioner from his place on the divan. ""Think well, Captain Hastings. If you refuse again, you go headlong to eternity, to meet your death in the dark waters below. For the last time, will you write that letter?"" I'm not braver than most men. I admit frankly that I was scared to death, and in a blue funk. That Chinese devil meant business, I was sure of that.",0
"I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.” “There has been a second attempt, then?” “Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has disappeared.” “What?” “He has been kidnapped!” “Impossible!” I cried, stupefied. Poirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut. “Unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,” continued his lordship. Poirot looked at Mr. Dodge. “You said just now, monsieur, that time was everything.",0
"I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. “All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?” It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it.",0
"“Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in getting the case dismissed but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer. He cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father’s disbelief.",0
"But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.",0
"” The inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us with a grin. “Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. It’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these Italian vendetta things, as likely as not.” Thus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was full of excitement. “Like the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn’t believe it if you read about it.” Poirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he had hardly opened his lips.",0
"“You understand, don’t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.” He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. “I understand,” I said gratefully. “And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.” “No, of course not.” “You know his real name?” The question surprised me. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar.",0
"Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well it sounds snobbish perhaps but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class.",0
"I doubt not he has visited the chess tourneys to study his part. He sits and frowns in thought; he gives the impression that he is thinking great plans, and all the time he laughs in himself. He is aware that two moves are all that he knows and all that he need know. Again, it would appeal to his mind to foresee the events and to make the man his own executioner at the exact time that suits Number Four.... Oh, yes, Hastings, I begin to understand our friend and his psychology."" I shrugged.",0
"That is what always happens to me and, after all, this is my private car, not Race’s. Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the beauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her principal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn’t even doing that. Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don’t blame her if so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew she is a repellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman. There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld.",0
"“Messieurs, mesdames, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur John Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept locked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain on the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of bromide powders.",0
"“You know when you asked me to marry you,” faltered Tuppence, her eyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian heroine, “and wouldn’t take no for an answer. I’ve thought it well over ” “Yes?” said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead. Tuppence relented suddenly. “You great idiot!” she said. “What on earth induced you to do it? I could see at the time you didn’t care a twopenny dip for me!” “Not at all. I had and still have the highest sentiments of esteem and respect and admiration for you ” “H’m!” said Tuppence.",0
"I’ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts. They’re beauties too, Anne and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me.",0
"“Dr. Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?” “Yes.” “Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my friend?” “Well, no one exactly told me,” I confessed. “But he is arrested.” “Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, mon ami.” “Espionage?” I gasped. “Precisely.” “Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?” “Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,” replied Poirot placidly.",0
"You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?” For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile. “That is so,” she acknowledged. “Were yours, too, left by hand by a Chinaman?” “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?” I recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened attentively. “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers.",0
"I wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face. Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs. The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish. The next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit. I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods, returning to the house about five.",0
"In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have £50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams.",0
"""But why?” “Parbleu! so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you.” “What?” “Mais, oui to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was dissatisfied. It was not strong enough!” He paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement: “And so, mon ami, since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible.” “Merlinville,” I murmured thoughtfully. “I’ve heard of it, I think.” Poirot nodded.",0
"Every port watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!” “Not Mr. Pagett?” “Oh, not Pagett the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.” “Have they arrested him?” asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring squeeze. I waited breathlessly for an answer. “He seems to have disappeared into thin air.” “How does Sir Eustace take it?” “Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.” An opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace’s views on the matter presented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note.",0
"Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.",0
"A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again.",0
"It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right especially with the help of this.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella.",0
"If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas.",0
"” Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast. “Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up to London, where she entered an officers’ hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes. Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter.",0
"“Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.",0
"In a moment or two, he said: “I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?” “Eh? I don’t get you?” “What I mean is that I don’t think it’s their game to do her any harm,” explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his mental processes. “She’s a hostage, that’s what she is. She’s in no immediate danger, because if we tumble on to anything, she’d be damned useful to them. As long as they’ve got her, they’ve got the whip hand of us. See?” “Sure thing,” said Julius thoughtfully. “That’s so.",0
"According to Poirot, these were all the work of the Big Four, and bore witness to the fact that they were in possession of various scientific secrets unknown to the world at large. This brought us straight to the question which I had been waiting for the French Premier to ask. ""You say that the third member of this organisation is a Frenchwoman. Have you any idea of her name?"" ""It is a well-known name, monsieur. An honoured name. Number Three is no less than the famous Madame Olivier."" At the mention of the world-famous scientist, successor to the Curies, M.",0
"Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead. A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime.",0
"""Ah!” Poirot studied her seriously. “Miss Howard, I will ask you one question. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.” “Never tell lies,” replied Miss Howard. “It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?” “What do you mean?” she asked sharply. “You needn’t think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest. I’ll admit that it wasn’t he who bought strychnine at the chemist’s shop. What of that? I dare say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.” “That is arsenic not strychnine,” said Poirot mildly.",0
"“Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain.",0
"I think it hardly likely that I can help you, since I have not been able to help them."" ""Madame, it is possible that I shall not ask you quite the same questions. To begin with, of what did you talk together, you and M. Halliday?"" She looked a trifle surprised. ""But of his work! His work and also mine."" ""Did he mention to you the theories he had embodied recently in his paper read before the British Association?"" ""Certainly he did. It was chiefly of those we spoke."" ""His ideas were somewhat fantastic, were they not?"" asked Poirot carelessly. ""Some people have thought so. I do not agree.",0
"Why did he do so? For the sake of the little jade figures? Or is he an agent of the Big Four? I confess that this last seems more likely. However valuable the jade, a man of that class was not likely to realise the fact at any rate, not to the point of committing murder for them. (That, par exemple, ought to have struck the Inspector.) He could have stolen the jade and made off with it instead of committing a brutal and quite purposeless murder. Ah, yes; I fear our Devonshire friend has not used his little gray cells.",0
"All this passed through my head in less time than it takes to tell, and I had clapped my hat on my head and was descending the stairs to where my guide waited, in a little over a minute. The bearer of the message was a tall impassive Chinaman, neatly but rather shabbily dressed. He bowed and spoke to me. His English was perfect, but he spoke with a slight sing-song intonation. ""You Captain Hastings?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""You give me note, please."" I had foreseen the request, and handed him over the scrap of paper without a word. But that was not all. ""You have telegram to-day, yes? Come along just now? From South America, yes?"" I realised anew the excellence of their espionage system or it might have been a shrewd guess.",0
"But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is! It’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but there you are she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.” “It must be a difficult situation for you all.” “Difficult! It’s damnable!” Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes.",0
"“I am investigating the death of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?” She bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can er throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned to her. “Marthe, dear ” But the girl shook her head. “No, maman, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.",0
"But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.” He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. “Information?” “Something of the kind.” “Diamonds,” I said to myself. “And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.” For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables.",0
"By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle, which left Cape Town in two days’ time. I had just time to journey down and catch the same boat. “I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board.",0
"Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.” She shook her head vigorously. “What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile. “A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too. Italian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.” “I shan’t. I like you did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.",0
"Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy. “But it is misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. “Aqua calda certainly ought to be cold water not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair.",0
"She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.” “You consider her vehemence unnatural?” “Y es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point.” Poirot shook his head energetically. “No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or degenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of well-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.” “Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania.",0
"To-morrow the daily papers, all over England, would blazon out the news in staring headlines: “MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX” “WEALTHY LADY POISONED” There would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of “The family leaving the Inquest” the village photographer had not been idle! All the things that one had read a hundred times things that happen to other people, not to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In front of us were “the detectives in charge of the case.",0
"The typewriter is in perfect condition.” “What do you mean all the cases?” “The two small cases as well.” “I wish you wouldn’t be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases were no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.” Pagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake. “So you can just pack them up again neatly,” I continued. “After that you can go out and look around you. Jo’burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last chance.” I thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the morning, at any rate. “There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure, Sir Eustace.” “I haven’t got it now,” I said hastily.",0
"“What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out ” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “Cette dame? What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.",0
"""Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?” The man looked up at him and started. “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours. The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.” “What about the jewel-case?” I asked. “It was found in a corridor of the hotel.",0
"""That may mean a long wait,"" I grumbled. ""Always impatient, the good Hastings! But no, it will not be so long. The one man they were afraid of myself is out of the way. I give them two or three months at most."" His speaking of some one being got out of the way reminded me of Ingles and his tragic death, and I remembered that I had never told Poirot about the dying Chinaman in St. Giles' Hospital. He listened with keen attention to my story. ""Ingles's servant, eh? And the few words he uttered were in Italian? Curious.",0
"She had decided not to ask if Sir James was “at home,” but to adopt a more personal attitude. “Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I have an important message for him.” The butler retired, returning a moment or two later. “Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?” He ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and Tuppence noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology. There were several deep-padded leather arm-chairs, and an old-fashioned open hearth.",0
"“That, I do not know! A document of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper Dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I ” his anger burst forth freely “miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have behaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I should have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is gone. It is destroyed but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance we must leave no stone unturned ” He rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I had sufficiently recovered my wits.",0
"Maman made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.",0
"Loosening his hold of me, he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to himself: “Yes, that alters everything everything.” Suddenly he seemed to come to a decision. “Allons!” he said. “We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?” John was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him. “Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new clue. May I take your motor?” “Why, of course. Do you mean at once?” “If you please.” John rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes, we were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.",0
"“All the same, I guess I’ll have a look round upstairs,” said Julius. “She might be in my sitting-room.” He disappeared. Suddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy’s elbow: “The young lady she’s gone away by train, I think, sir,” he murmured shyly. “What?” Tommy wheeled round upon him. The small boy became pinker than before. “The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to look sharp.” Tommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise. Emboldened, the small boy proceeded. “So I thought, having asked for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw.” Tommy interrupted him: “When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?” “When I took her the telegram, sir.” “A telegram?” “Yes, sir.",0
"“I don’t think so. I took to him at once. No, I’m pretty sure Dr. Hall’s all right.” “Hall, did you say?” asked Sir James. “That is curious really very curious.” “Why?” demanded Tuppence. “Because I happened to meet him this morning. I’ve known him slightly on and off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street. Staying at the Métropole, he told me.” He turned to Julius. “Didn’t he tell you he was coming up to town?” Julius shook his head. “Curious,” mused Sir James.",0
"And then and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way down, well Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists. Such an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter of this afternoon. Intoxicated by his plan, Tommy gently unhooked the picture of the Devil and Faust, and settled himself in position. His hopes were high. The plan seemed to him simple but excellent. Time went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the same in this prison room, but Tommy’s wrist-watch, which enjoyed a certain degree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine o’clock in the evening.",0
"The door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy brought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went down amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had slipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned it and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from the inside with a volley of curses.",0
"Renauld? Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night, some one who would benefit by his death the description fits Jack Renauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point. “Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There were two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that.",0
"I feel, though, that I should like to point out to you once more the risks you are running, especially if you pursue the course you indicate. Those people are absolutely desperate and incapable of either mercy or pity. I feel that you probably underestimate the danger, and therefore warn you again that I can promise you no protection. You have given us valuable information, and if you choose to withdraw now no one could blame you. At any rate, think the matter over well before you decide. “If, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through with it, you will find everything arranged.",0
"“Luckily I haven’t got your craving for crime! What time is it? Let’s have lunch oh!” The same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it first. “Julius P. Hersheimmer!” “We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.” “Well, there wasn’t much to tell not till we’ve seen him. Come on, we’d better take a taxi.” “Now who’s being extravagant?” “All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.” “At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,” said Tuppence, leaning back luxuriously. “I’m sure blackmailers never arrive in buses!” “We’ve ceased being blackmailers,” Tommy pointed out.",0
"That leaves us two possibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a reason of his own for his absence.” “And that reason?” I asked sceptically. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp, I should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel but that does not of necessity make him a murderer.” I shook my head, unconvinced. “We do not agree, eh?” said Poirot. “Well, let us leave it. Time will show which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the case.",0
"Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island.",0
"But I don’t think we ought to leave the flat.” “What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?” “Albert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert couldn’t stop her.” “I guess she won’t want to make tracks away from the dollars.” “She might. She seemed very frightened of ‘Mr. Brown.’” “What? Real plumb scared of him?” “Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.” “Maybe she meant a dictaphone,” said Julius with interest. “Miss Tuppence is right,” said Sir James quietly. “We must not leave the flat if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer’s sake.” Julius stared at him.",0
"“Breakfast is ready,” said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall. “You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?” Poirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to his normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset him temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal. He was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his brother, who had, perhaps, too much.",0
"” The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt? I wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s reply was prompt: “Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.",0
"“Mr. Brown exists.” He turned to Tommy. “Did you happen to notice where that wire was handed in?” “No, sir, I’m afraid I didn’t.” “H’m. Got it with you?” “It’s upstairs, sir, in my kit.” “I’d like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You’ve wasted a week” Tommy hung his head “a day or so more is immaterial. We’ll deal with Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards, we’ll set to work to rescue Miss Tuppence from bondage. I don’t think she’s in any immediate danger. That is, so long as they don’t know that we’ve got Jane Finn, and that her memory has returned. We must keep that dark at all costs.",0
"“Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the Daily Budget.” “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. “I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully.",0
"They have won the first trick; but they have failed in their plan to get me out of the way, and in the future they have to reckon with Hercule Poirot!"" For a day or two after our visit from the fake Asylum attendant I was in some hopes that he might return, and I refused to leave the flat even for a moment. As far as I could see, he had no reason to suspect that we had penetrated his disguise. He might, I thought, return and try to remove the body, but Poirot scoffed at my reasoning. ""Mon ami,"" he said, ""if you wish you may wait in to put salt on the little bird's tail, but for me I do not waste my time so.",0
"‘Tell them to get me a taxi,’ and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told you.” The small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued to stare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an open letter in his hand. “I say, Hersheimmer” Tommy turned to him “Tuppence has gone off sleuthing on her own.” “Shucks!” “Yes, she has.",0
"""And then, mon ami, grand resurrection of Hercule Poirot! At the eleventh hour I reappear, throw all into confusion, and achieve the supreme victory in my own unique manner!"" I realised that Poirot's vanity was of the case-hardened variety which could withstand all attacks. I reminded him that once or twice the honours of the game had lain with our adversaries. But I might have known that it was impossible to diminish Hercule Poirot's enthusiasm for his own methods. ""See you, Hastings, it is like the little trick that you play with the cards.",0
"Would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking? “I shall not ask her to tell me anything,” he said quietly. “Not in so many words, that is.” “Then why see her?” Tommy paused. “To watch her face when I ask her one question,” he replied at last. Again there was a look in the German’s eyes that Tommy did not quite understand. “She will not be able to answer your question.” “That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it.” “And you think that will tell you anything?” He gave a short disagreeable laugh.",0
"They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: “But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear now?” And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. “I am afraid for you.",0
"But why did you go to Marlow?” “It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances yes, I still feel natural under the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I cried desperately. For the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me. “I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I fail to see your concern in the matter.” He was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt desperate.",0
"You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons would be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made.",0
"""We’ll have to chance that. I’m glad you like the plan.” He rose. “Where are you going?” “To buy the car, of course,” replied Julius, surprised. “What make do you like? I guess you’ll do some riding in it before we’ve finished.” “Oh,” said Tuppence faintly, “I like Rolls-Royces, but ” “Sure,” agreed Julius. “What you say goes. I’ll get one.” “But you can’t at once,” cried Tuppence. “People wait ages sometimes.” “Little Julius doesn’t,” affirmed Mr. Hersheimmer. “Don’t you worry any. I’ll be round in the car in half an hour.” Tuppence got up. “You’re awfully good, Julius.",0
"Then he went round the room like a strange cat, cautiously, delicately, on the alert for danger. I watched him for some time, remaining obediently where I had been put by the wall. ""It's all right, Poirot,"" I said impatiently. ""It seems so, mon ami, it seems so. But let us make sure."" ""Rot,"" I said. ""I shall light the fire, anyway, and have a pipe. I've caught you out for once. You had the matches last and you didn't put them back in the holder as usual the very thing you're always cursing me for doing."" I stretched out my hand. I heard Poirot's warning cry saw him leaping towards me my hand touched the match-box.",0
"” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled. I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was. “That man? Oh, that’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary. Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before.",0
"The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",0
"A voice inside called out something, and the man opened the door and passed in, affording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside. He thought there must be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up most of the space, but his attention was caught and held by a tall man with close-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard, who sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him.",0
"My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some ‘salt’ on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs. Inglethorp’s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and sent it to be analysed.” “But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,” said Lawrence quickly. “Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine was, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a narcotic.” “For a narcotic?” “Yes. Here is the analyst’s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe, but effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle Cynthia.",0
"Well, what is it?” “When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece of paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead man. The doctor didn’t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some figures.” “Let’s see it.” Lord Nasby stretched out a careless hand. “I think not,” I said, smiling. “It’s my find, you see.” “I’m right. You are a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it. No scruples about not handing it over to the police?” “I went there to do so this morning.",0
"No one would dream the picture had ever been tampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in my coat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place. They’d never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I hoped that they’d come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying a dummy all along, and that, in the end, they’d let me go. “As a matter of fact, I guess that’s what they did think at first, and, in a way, it was dangerous for me.",0
"“I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,” said Tuppence. “Will you come this way, please.” He crossed to a partition door with “Private” on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood aside to let her pass in. Mr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers. Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was something wrong about Mr. Whittington. The combination of his sleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive. He looked up and nodded. “So you’ve turned up all right? That’s good. Sit down, will you?” Tuppence sat down on the chair facing him.",0
"Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?” Tuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and wider. “What should we have to do?” she breathed. Mr. Carter smiled. “Just go on with what you’re doing now. Find Jane Finn.” “Yes, but who is Jane Finn?” Mr. Carter nodded gravely. “Yes, you’re entitled to know that, I think.” He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips of his fingers together, and began in a low monotone: “Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does not concern you.",0
"Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.",0
"Mother figured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get over being mad with her.” “The old man was like that,” admitted Julius. “But I guess the new generation’s sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business. First thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along and hunt you up.” A shadow passed over the girl’s face. “They’ve been telling me things dreadful things that my memory went, and that there are years I shall never know about years lost out of my life.” “You didn’t realize that yourself?” The girl’s eyes opened wide.",0
"I asked again where I was, and then went on that there was something I must remember must remember only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn’t know that I couldn’t remember anything at all. “Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful. I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but I managed to shriek out things in French. I don’t know how long I could have gone on, but luckily I fainted.",0
"The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her. But she was checkmated not by Hercule Poirot but by la petite acrobate with her wrists of steel.” I mused over the whole story. “When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?” Poirot smiled.",0
"At the very end of it was a table behind which four chairs were placed. The end chair was empty, but was draped with a mandarin's cape. On the second, smoking a cigar, sat Mr. Abe Ryland. Leaning back in the third chair, with her burning eyes and her nun's face, was Madame Olivier. Number Four took his seat on the fourth chair. We were in the presence of the Big Four. Never before had I felt so fully the reality and the presence of Li Chang Yen as I did now when confronting his empty seat. Far away in China, he yet controlled and directed this malign organisation. Madame Olivier gave a faint cry on seeing us.",0
"See here, he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his irreproachable alibi and, hey presto, he was safe for life!” “But I still don’t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to the chemist’s shop?” Poirot stared at me in surprise. “Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was Miss Howard who went to the chemist’s shop?” “Miss Howard?” “But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her.",0
"""It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?” “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew.",0
"“Well?” he grunted. It was at that moment that the full realization of his folly began to come home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He seized at the first words that came into his mind. “Mr. Brown?” he said. To his surprise the man stood aside. “Upstairs,” he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, “second door on your left.” TAKEN aback though he was by the man’s words, Tommy did not hesitate. If audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was to be hoped it would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed into the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything in the house was filthy beyond words.",0
"""I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your possession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is a question of ideas.” “Still, it would be interesting to know.” Poirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head. “You see,” he said sadly, “you have no instincts.” “It was intelligence you were requiring just now,” I pointed out. “The two often go together,” said Poirot enigmatically. The remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the trouble to answer it.",0
"But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that.",0
"It’s mainly owing to him, and to his large subscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a say in the designing of it.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. Then he remarked: “It was not a very good choice they made of a spot to bury the body? When the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been discovered.” “Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that proves that they were strangers to the place. It’s an excellent piece of indirect evidence.” “Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body there unless unless they wanted it to be discovered.",0
"In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into the car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to die down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence incriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were holding the Prime Minister? Our return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We deviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally stopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital.",0
"Desjardeaux is over in London, and at my request the Home Secretary had arranged for him to be present at our little conference this morning."" The Right Honourable Sydney Crowther, His Majesty's Secretary of State for Home Affairs, was a well-known and popular figure. A man of some fifty years of age, with a quizzical expression and shrewd gray eyes, he received us with that delightful bonhomie of manner which was well known to be one of his principal assets. Standing with his back to the fireplace was a tall thin man with a pointed black beard and a sensitive face. ""M.",0
"He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” “And they have found nothing else?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.",0
"Tried the front way in, but that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn’t taking any. I guess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in one wouldn’t cut ice with him! It’s a real piece of luck happening on you this way. Come on, show me all the sights.” “But look here wait a minute I can’t. Nobody’s allowed in. They’re awfully strict.” “Aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?” I was loath to relinquish my position of importance. “Why are you so keen?” I asked weakly. “And what is it you want to see.",0
"It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them something in the nature of joss-stick that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?” I shook my head. “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.” “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.” We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery.",0
"Well, I must wish you good night, Monsieur Poirot, unless” He hesitated. “I perceive the thought in your mind,” said Poirot, smiling. “I shall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get hold of a taxi.” Taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon bowling along in the direction of Regent’s Park. Regent’s Court was a new block of flats, situated just off St. John’s Wood Road. They had only recently been built, and contained the latest service devices. There was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell impatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply. “Flat II.",0
"She seems to be having some kind of fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.” “I’ll come at once.” I sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house. John Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing round in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his brother. “What do you think we had better do?” Never, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent. John rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp’s door violently, but with no effect.",0
"She was very pale, but smiling. “I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her mother-in-law’s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed table, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish, startled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She picks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room, closing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the servants must not find her where she is.",0
"That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.",0
"I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time, perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss Howard. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she handed to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words: “On top of the wardrobe.” Then she hurriedly left the room.",0
"“What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just as well as strychnine. If I’m convinced he did it, it doesn’t matter a jot to me how he did it.” “Exactly. If you are convinced he did it,” said Poirot quietly. “I will put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?” “Good heavens!” cried Miss Howard. “Haven’t I always told you the man is a villain? Haven’t I always told you he would murder her in her bed? Haven’t I always hated him like poison?” “Exactly,” said Poirot. “That bears out my little idea entirely.",0
"""About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are but I’ve got another roll.",0
"Inglethorp took sleeping powders?” I asked, in lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. “And about the lost key and the duplicate?” “One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.” He suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for powders. “Where did you find it?” “In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom. It was Number Six of my catalogue.” “But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of much importance?” “Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar about this box?” I examined it closely. “No, I can’t say that I do.” “Look at the label.” I read the label carefully: “‘One powder to be taken at bedtime, if required.",0
"He seems to regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand, regard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful. “We’ll get an extra cabin,” I said hastily. The thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?” “The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,” replied Pagett seriously. “But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there’s something very queer about that cabin.” Memories of reading The Upper Berth floated through my mind.",0
"He was last seen at eleven Friday night but was he seen then?"" ""The porter "" ""A night porter who had not previously seen Halliday. A man comes in, sufficiently like Halliday -we may trust Number Four for that asks for letters, goes upstairs, packs a small suit-case, and slips out the next morning. Nobody saw Halliday all that evening no, because he was already in the hands of his enemies. Was it Halliday whom Madame Olivier received? Yes, for though she did not know him by sight, an imposter could hardly deceive her on her own special subject.",0
"The conversation that she had overheard, although interesting in that it proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and Boris, threw very little light on the present preoccupations. The name of Jane Finn had not even been mentioned. The following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her that nothing was waiting for her at the stationer’s. It seemed incredible that Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send any word to her. A cold hand seemed to close round her heart Supposing She choked her fears down bravely. It was no good worrying. But she leapt at a chance offered her by Mrs. Vandemeyer. “What day do you usually go out, Prudence?” “Friday’s my usual day, ma’am.",0
"What did you mean by that?” The two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said: “You have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied Conference?” My friend nodded. “For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow Thursday evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity.",0
"Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence, and admitted that the “Russians” were a pure invention on her part. The real murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had committed the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had consented also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime.",0
"""It must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like you.” “Well, I’m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and goes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking.",0
"It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter.",0
"Cavendish?” “My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was taking a tonic containing strychnine.” “Ah!” said the Coroner. The jury looked up, interested. “I believe,” continued Lawrence, “that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by causing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident?” “This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr.",0
"I’ve always heard you Revolutionists held life cheap, but it seems there’s a difference when it’s your own life in question. I gave you just one chance of saving your dirty skin, and that you wouldn’t take!” “They would kill me!” “Well,” said Julius pleasantly, “it’s up to you. But I’ll just say this. Little Willie here is a dead cert, and if I was you I’d take a sporting chance with Mr. Brown!” “You will hang if you shoot me,” muttered the Russian irresolutely. “No, stranger, that’s where you’re wrong. You forget the dollars.",0
"But it has led to nothing.” “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?” A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced anyone above suspicion.” “Très bien. Now I understand, milord, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?” Lord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes.",0
"Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with three people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.",0
"A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. “Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.",0
"Bronsen was bound to cable me. They would wait until the cable was delivered and would strike hard upon it. No good could come of denying what was palpably true. ""Yes,"" I said. ""I did get a telegram."" ""You fetch him, yes? Fetch him now."" I ground my teeth, but what could I do. I ran upstairs again. As I did so, I thought of confiding in Mrs. Pearson, at any rate as far as Cinderella's disappearance went. She was on the landing, but close behind her was the little maid-servant, and I hesitated. If she was a spy the words of the note danced before my eyes. "".",0
"“Oh, do tell us!” Race smiled. “Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so it was reported, had returned from that part of South America bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some of them of considerable size.",0
"“Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see” He paused delicately. “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head. The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us. “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?” She shook her head.",0
"When she turned, Mrs. Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as ice Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now Her cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs. Vandemeyer was dead must have been dead some hours. She had evidently died in her sleep. “If that isn’t the cruellest luck,” cried Julius in despair. The lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes. “If it is luck,” he replied. “You don’t think but, say, that’s plumb impossible no one could have got in.” “No,” admitted the lawyer.",0
"At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French window near at hand: “Then you’ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I’ll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there’s the Duchess about the school fête.” There was the murmur of a man’s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp’s rose in reply: “Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful, Alfred dear.",0
"Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise !” he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. “Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and ” “You will not have to send far, M. le juge.” The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window.",0
"In a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and accosted the shorter of the two. “I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.” “Why, if it isn’t Mr. Poirot!” cried the Inspector. He turned to the other man. “You’ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I worked together the Abercrombie forgery case you remember, he was run down in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you remember ‘Baron’ Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe.",0
"“It’s impossible! Five years! Think of it! Bird’s-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people passing! It can’t be there! It’s a hundred to one against its being there! It’s against all reason!” Indeed, he felt it to be impossible more, perhaps, because he could not believe in his own success where so many others had failed. The thing was too easy, therefore it could not be. The hole would be empty. Julius looked at him with a widening smile. “I guess you’re rattled now all right,” he drawled with some enjoyment. “Well, here goes!” He thrust his hand into the crevice, and made a slight grimace.",0
"We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. Ça vous dit quelque chose? I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini’s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?” I shook my head, utterly bewildered. “Come, I will help you.",0
"” The words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked up with a start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with which he raised his glass to his lips shook slightly, but his eyes held Sir James’s defiantly. For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to burst into flame, but in the end Julius lowered his eyes, defeated. “For the moment, I reckon you’re the boss.” “Thank you,” said the other. “We will say ten o’clock then?” With consummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. “I must confess, Mr.",0
"I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands.",0
"His face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck me afresh. Mrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was unusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little attentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the part of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp retired to her boudoir again. “Send my coffee in here, Mary,” she called. “I’ve just five minutes to catch the post.” Cynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary Cavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.",0
"You have seen it without doubt? You take the four knaves, you divide them, one on top of the pack, one underneath, and so on you cut and you shuffle, and there they are all together again. That is my object. So far I have been contending, now against one of the Big Four, now against another. But let me get them all together, like the four knaves in the pack of cards, and then, with one coup, I destroy them all!"" ""And how do you propose to get them all together?"" I asked. ""By awaiting the supreme moment. By lying perdu until they are ready to strike.",0
"I could afford to smile to myself! The sea was not too choppy. I enjoyed a passable dinner, made up my mind as to the majority of my fellow passengers, and had a rubber or two of Bridge. Then I turned in and slept like a log as I always do on board ship. I was awakened by feeling myself persistently shaken. Dazed and bewildered, I saw that one of the ship's officers was standing over me. He gave a sigh of relief as I sat up. ""Thank the Lord I've got you awake at last. I've had no end of a job. Do you always sleep like that?"" ""What's the matter?"" I asked, still bewildered and not fully awake.",0
"“Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively. We pulled up in front of the station. Here surely he would leave us. I turned with outstretched hand but no. “I’ll come and see you off. It’s just eight o’clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.” He gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train.",0
"“That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn’t!” “Well,” I said consolingly, “it will be the other way about to-morrow.” “Yes,” she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. “Mr. Hastings, you do not think surely it could not have been Lawrence Oh, no, that could not be!” But I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I asked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at. “Ah!” said Poirot appreciatively. “He is a clever man, that Sir Ernest.",0
"The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice.",0
"Perhaps,"" he added, as a knock sounded on the door, ""you have here your chance; it may be our friend who enters."" And he laughed at my disappointment when Inspector Japp and another man entered the room. ""Good-evening, moosior,"" said the Inspector. ""Allow me to introduce Captain Kent of the United States Secret Service."" Captain Kent was a tall, lean American, with a singularly impassive face which looked as though it had been carved out of wood. ""Pleased to meet you, gentlemen,"" he murmured, as he shook hands jerkily.",0
"“The old man was being bled and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet.",0
"Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting. “Good,” said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. “I will take these with me for the ‘Colonel’ to see.” “When do you leave?” “Ten o’clock to-morrow morning will do.” “Do you want to see the girl before you go?” “No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the ‘Colonel’ comes. Is she all right?” “I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I think.",0
"Well, sir, as I said, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and angry in here. I didn’t exactly mean to listen, but well, there it is. I stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. ‘You have lied to me, and deceived me,’ she said. I didn’t hear what Mr. Inglethorp replied.",0
"""Yes, that’s true. I never thought of that.” I was rather startled. “It is odd.” Poirot nodded. “From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household, he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine poisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been Monsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical knowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence no! And now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have known was ridiculous.",0
"” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion.",0
"Brown is here” “In this house?” “In this room You don’t understand? I am Mr. Brown” Stupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of his face had changed. It was a different man who stood before them. He smiled a slow cruel smile. “Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had succeeded. I have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.” His smile grew wider as he looked at Tuppence. “Shall I tell you how it will be? Sooner or later the police will break in, and they will find three victims of Mr.",0
"Cavendish.” Dr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea. “What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell you the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison, but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is absurd.” “And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose?” “Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.",0
"I don’t think I can have noticed it.” “It does not matter,” said Poirot, not betraying any sign of disappointment. “Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have that every night?” “Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up in the night whenever she fancied it.” “What was it? Plain cocoa?” “Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it.” “Who took it to her room?” “I did, sir.” “Always?” “Yes, sir.",0
"""The stars fight against us but is it the stars?"" He lifted his head as though struck by a sudden idea. ""Is it the stars, Hastings? If it is not if it is not.... Oh, I swear to you, my friend, standing here by this poor woman's body, that I will have no mercy when the time comes!"" ""What do you mean?"" I asked. But Poirot had turned to the nurse and was eagerly demanding information. A list of the articles found in her hand-bag was finally obtained. Poirot gave a suppressed cry as he read it over. ""You see, Hastings, you see?"" ""See what?"" ""There is no mention of a latch-key.",0
"""Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack.",0
"Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly. “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us.",0
"“Amen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time. But this is dark dark. I cannot see.” “Well, Poirot,” I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the Ministers, “what do you think?” My friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft movements. He shook his head thoughtfully. “I do not know what to think. My brains desert me.” “Why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do as well?” I mused. “Pardon me, mon ami, but I did not quite say that.",0
"Just before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road, Tommy, unperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the big Lyons’. There they went up to the first floor, and sat at a small table in the window. It was late, and the place was thinning out. Tommy took a seat at the table next to them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case of recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man and studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole.",0
"Word had come that he was to be killed. I needn’t tell the next part, because you know it. I thought I’d have time to rush up and get the papers from their hiding-place, but I was caught. So I screamed out that he was escaping, and I said I wanted to go back to Marguerite. I shouted the name three times very loud. I knew the others would think I meant Mrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped it might make Mr. Beresford think of the picture. He’d unhooked one the first day that’s what made me hesitate to trust him.” She paused.",0
"I’ve been the most almighty blithering darned idiot that it’s possible to imagine. Calm down” Tommy had made an impatient gesture “I’m going right away now going to the London and North Western Railway depot, if you want to know.” “I don’t care a damn where you’re going,” growled Tommy. As the door closed behind Julius, he returned to his suit-case. “That’s the lot,” he murmured, and rang the bell. “Take my luggage down.” “Yes, sir. Going away, sir?” “I’m going to the devil,” said Tommy, regardless of the menial’s feelings. That functionary, however, merely replied respectfully: “Yes, sir.",0
"“Ain’t there anything I could do? A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?” Tuppence affected to consider, then shook her head. “Not at the moment, but I’ll bear you in mind, son. What’s this about the girl you say is leaving?” “Annie? Regular turn up, they ‘ad. As Annie said, servants is some one nowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with her passing the word round, she won’t find it so easy to get another.” “Won’t she?” said Tuppence thoughtfully. “I wonder ” An idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two, then tapped Albert on the shoulder.",0
"""How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed.",0
"” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot.",0
""" As he spoke I saw a sudden suspicion flash into her eyes, and at the same moment I knew the truth which subconsciously I already sensed. The man beside me was not Hercule Poirot. He was very like him, extraordinarily like him. There was the same egg-shaped head, the same strutting figure, delicately plump. But the voice was different, and the eyes instead of being green were dark, and surely the moustaches those famous moustaches ? My reflections were cut short by the countess's voice. She stepped forward, her voice ringing with excitement. ""You have been deceived.",0
"“Tuppence, will you ” He indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand. But Tuppence shook her head. “No that’s Jane’s place! When one thinks of how she’s held out all these years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast to-night.” Julius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly to the allotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned. Tuppence had performed her part faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled “A tiger lily.",0
"After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and leave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit. He gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news. “Great Scott! You were right, then. I couldn’t believe it at the time.” “No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it makes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be generally known to-morrow.” John reflected. “Never mind,” he said at last, “we won’t say anything at present. There is no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.",0
"At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up. “Keep still, please,” I said. He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a little. “Thank you, I don’t need anything done for me.” His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks of even common gratitude! “That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” He flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour of him. My temper, never placid, rose.",0
"Dorcas’s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had already heard, so I will not repeat it here. The next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the Coroner’s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at four-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the sound of something heavy falling. “That would have been the table by the bed?” commented the Coroner. “I opened my door,” continued Mary, “and listened. In a few minutes a bell rang violently.",0
"“The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way. There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room, and sitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough. He was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse. She was sitting with her back to me, so I couldn’t see her face. Although the blinds were up, the window itself was shut, so I couldn’t catch a word of what they said. Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse just listened.",0
"“To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.” We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests: “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?” “Yes somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think” “That you will need it? It is quite possible.",0
"""And I don’t know that I’m so comfortably married either,” continued Suzanne in a melancholy voice. “I’ve been having the most dreadful cables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once. At last I didn’t answer them, and now I haven’t heard for over a fortnight.” I’m afraid I didn’t take Suzanne’s matrimonial troubles very seriously. She will be able to get round Clarence all right when the times comes. I turned the conversation to the subject of the diamonds. Suzanne looked at me with a dropped jaw. “I must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect Colonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds.",0
"I turned to Mary with a gesture of despair. “He’ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes, round the corner!” Our eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another. “What can be the matter?” I shook my head. “I don’t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he had an idea, and rushed off as you saw.” “Well,” said Mary, “I expect he will be back before dinner.” But night fell, and Poirot had not returned. Poirot’s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning wore away, and still he did not reappear.",0
"“Now then, stand back there, will you? What’s the sense in crowding round.” A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I must get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up, another having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so, he dropped a piece of paper. I stopped, picked it up, and ran after him. But the lift gates clanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand.",0
"There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying.",0
"""Then,” I said, much amused, “you think that if you were mixed up in a crime, say a murder, you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?” “Of course I should. Mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers. But I’m certain I’d know. I’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near me.” “It might be a ‘she’,” I suggested. “Might. But murder’s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.” “Not in a case of poisoning.” Mrs. Cavendish’s clear voice startled me. “Dr.",0
"""Well, Monsieur Poirot, shall I leave you for a little conversation with Miss Monro?"" ""You are too amiable. But stay a little idea presents itself to me. The hour of the déjeuner approaches. Mademoiselle will perhaps honour me by coming out to luncheon with me?"" Miss Monro's eyes glistened. It struck me that she was in exceedingly low water, and that the chance of a square meal was not to be despised. A few minutes later saw us all in a taxi, bound for one of London's most expensive restaurants. Once arrived there, Poirot ordered a most delectable lunch, and then turned to his guest.",0
"Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently.",0
"” Then she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter.",0
"Lawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my high horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage. This time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within. Would I mount? I mounted accordingly. Poirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He sprang up at my entrance. “What is it?” I asked solicitously. “You are not ill, I trust?” “No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.” “Whether to catch the criminal or not?” I asked facetiously. But, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.",0
"""What you think is always so important to yourself, Hastings. But let us pass from the mystery of the Yellow Jasmine to the Mystery of the Curry."" ""I know. Who poisoned it? Why? There are a hundred questions one can ask. Ah Ling, of course, prepared it. But why should he wish to kill his master? Is he a member of a tong, or something like that. One reads of such things. The tong of the Yellow Jasmine, perhaps. Then there is Gerald Paynter."" I came to an abrupt pause. ""Yes,"" said Poirot, nodding his head. ""There is Gerald Paynter, as you say. He is his uncle's heir. He was dining out that night, though.",0
"[Illustration] “Where did you find this?” I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity. “In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?” “Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp’s. But what does it mean?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “I cannot say but it is suggestive.” A wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp’s mind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she might have taken her own life? I was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words distracted me.",0
"I felt wrapped all round with the atmosphere of the East, tortuous, cunning, sinister Suddenly my guide rolled aside two of the casks, and I saw a low tunnel-like opening in the wall. He motioned me to go ahead. The tunnel was of some length, and it was just too low for me to stand upright. At last, however, it broadened out into a passage, and a few minutes later we stood in another cellar. My Chinaman went forward, and rapped four times on one of the walls. A whole section of the wall swung out, leaving a narrow doorway.",0
"It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But ” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the ” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “Mille tonnerres!” cried Poirot.",0
"Wells, “I had thought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor’s report. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?” “Yes.” “Then that arrangement will suit you?” “Perfectly.” “I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this most tragic affair.” “Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?” interposed Poirot, speaking for the first time since we had entered the room. “I?” “Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should have received the letter this morning.",0
"Natural! I went on, ‘I’m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He’s a bad lot. You can say what you like to me, but remember what I’ve told you. He’s a bad lot!’” “What did she say?” Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace. “‘Darling Alfred’ ‘dearest Alfred’ ‘wicked calumnies’ ‘wicked lies’ ‘wicked woman’ to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ The sooner I left her house the better. So I’m off.” “But not now?” “This minute!” For a moment we sat and stared at her.",0
"I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door.",0
"""Messieurs, you interviewed me yesterday about the disappearance of M. Halliday. I now learn that you returned to the house a second time, and asked to see my secretary, Inez Veroneau. She left the house with you, and has not returned here since."" ""Is that all, madame?"" ""No, monsieur, it is not. Last night the laboratory was broken into, and several valuable papers and memoranda were stolen. The thieves had a try for something more precious still, but luckily they failed to open the big safe."" ""Madame, these are the facts of the case. Your late secretary, Madame Veroneau, was really the Countess Rossakoff, an expert thief, and it was she who was responsible for the disappearance of M.",0
"Ah, you Frenchmen! Naughty, naughty!"" She wagged her finger at him in an excess of archness. ""Well, there it was, me and Claudie, two young things what else could you expect? And I've still a kindly feeling for him. Though, mind you, he didn't treat me well no, he didn't he didn't treat me well at all. Not as a lady should be treated. They're all the same when it comes to a question of money."" ""No, no, mademoiselle, do not say that,"" protested Poirot, filling up her glass once more. ""Could you now describe this Mr. Darrell to me?"" ""He wasn't anything so very much to look at,"" said Flossie Monro dreamily.",0
"Then a flash of blue flame an ear-rending crash and darkness I came to myself to find the familiar face of our old friend Dr. Ridgeway bending over me. An expression of relief passed over his features. ""Keep still,"" he said soothingly. ""You're all right. There's been an accident, you know."" ""Poirot?"" I murmured. ""You're in my digs. Everything's quite all right."" A cold fear clutched at my heart. His evasion woke a horrible fear. ""Poirot?"" I reiterated. ""What of Poirot."" He saw that I had to know and that further evasions were useless.",0
"""But he found you again with very little trouble, did he not? In spite of all the years that had passed?"" ""Yes, it was quite a bit of luck my seeing the lawyer's advertisement."" Poirot asked no more questions. Our next move was to visit Dr. Quentin. His story was substantially the same as he had told at the inquest, and he had little to add to it. He received us in his surgery, having just come to the end of his consulting patients. He seemed an intelligent man. A certain primness of manner went well with his pince-nez, but I fancied that he would be thoroughly modern in his methods.",0
"""Do not converse with me,"" he cried, waving an agitated hand. ""Not until I know that all is well that the arrest is made. Ah! but my psychology has been weak. Hastings, if a man writes a dying message, it is because it is important. Every one has said 'Yellow Jasmine? There is yellow jasmine growing up the house it means nothing.'"" ""Well, what does it mean? Just what it says. Listen."" He held up a little book he was holding. ""My friend, it struck me that it would be well to inquire into the subject.",0
"” We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face blanched noticeably. “You,” she gasped. “I thought you were on the sea on your way to East Africa?” “I got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the young man. “My old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money.",0
"That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.” “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?” “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr.",0
"""Here I am Moosior Poirot. What can I do for you? Thought you were off to the coral strands of somewhere or other to-day?"" ""My good Japp, I want to know if you have ever seen this man before."" He led Japp into the bedroom. The inspector stared down at the figure on the bed with a puzzled face. ""Let me see now he seems sort of familiar and I pride myself on my memory, too. Why, God bless my soul, it's Mayerling!"" ""And who is or was Mayerling?"" ""Secret Service chap not one of our people. Went to Russia five years ago. Never heard of again. Always thought the Bolshies had done him in.",0
"If I had chosen to be an actor, I should have been the greatest actor living! No disguises no grease paint no false beards! Personality! I put it on like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet, unobtrusive, a man like every other man. I called myself Mr. Brown. There are hundreds of men called Brown there are hundreds of men looking just like me “ I succeeded in my false career. I was bound to succeed. I shall succeed in the other. A man like me cannot fail “ I have been reading a life of Napoleon. He and I have much in common “ I make a practice of defending criminals.",0
"“When shall we start?” “The hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing is likely to occur before then.” At twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot’s manipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed into the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar. “Now we have but to wait,” said Poirot contentedly, closing his eyes. To me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to sleep.",0
"""What?” “Imitation, mon ami.” The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!” “Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm. “Where?” “We must tell the Opalsens at once.” “I think not.” “But that poor woman” “Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.” “But the thief may escape with them!” “As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs.",0
"Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory.",0
"Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted.",0
"Was I really good-looking? Honestly, I couldn’t say I thought so! I hadn’t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the things you ought to have. It is true that a curate once told me that my eyes were like “imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood” but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them off at random. I’d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow flecks! Still, green is a good colour for adventuresses. I wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and shoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down over my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual.",0
"There had been times when I hardly thought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth. “Yes,” he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, “you will be invaluable.” This was naturally gratifying, but Poirot’s next words were not so welcome. “I must have an ally in the house,” he observed reflectively. “You have me,” I protested. “True, but you are not sufficient.” I was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself. “You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me. I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.” “Oh, I see. How about John?” “No, I think not.",0
"Foscatini sits down, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind Graves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to the service telephone dinner for three! It comes, he lays the table, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to get rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a resolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos, the rice soufflé is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion.",0
"Are you better tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it’s all about?” “I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.” “Why not?” I said, chagrined. He smiled nastily. “If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.” “Don’t you think I could keep a secret?” “I don’t think I know.” He rose to his feet. “At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events of this evening.” “I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently. “How dare you?” I cried angrily.",0
"An expression gathered there that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved. “Bien!” he said at last. “It is evident! I had an idea but clearly I was mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no matter!” And, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was worrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot had been a great man in his day.",0
"I’ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways, Monsieur Poirot and I’m head over ears in debt but I want to pull up. I’m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten things up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf is offering me big money enough to set me on my feet again. I don’t want to do it I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the Chase but I may have to, unless” He broke off. Poirot eyed him keenly.",0
"""And you have heard of this Li Chang Yen?"" ""Until M. Poirot here came to me, I imagined that I was the only man in England who had. Make no mistake, M. Desjardeaux, there is only one man in China who counts to-day Li Chang Yen. He has, perhaps, I only say perhaps, the finest brain in the world at the present time."" M. Desjardeaux sat as though stunned. Presently, however, he rallied. ""There may be something in what you say, M. Poirot,"" he said coldly. ""But as regards Madame Olivier, you are most certainly mistaken.",0
"It may sound harsh, but my advice to you is: Cut your losses. Time’s merciful. You’ll forget.” “Forget Tuppence? Never!” Mr. Carter shook his head. “So you think now. Well, it won’t bear thinking of that brave little girl! I’m sorry about the whole business confoundedly sorry.” Tommy came to himself with a start. “I’m taking up your time, sir,” he said with an effort. “There’s no need for you to blame yourself. I dare say we were a couple of young fools to take on such a job. You warned us all right. But I wish to God I’d been the one to get it in the neck.",0
"“Supposing she is not able to give one?” “What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.” “So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concerning any events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to you.” They looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully. “It’s a pity,” he said. “A great pity, especially as I gather, Sir James, that the matter is important. But there it is, she can tell you nothing.” “But why, man? Darn it all, why?” The little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young American. “Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory.” “What?” “Quite so.",0
"It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle, and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied. We went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or bolted on the inside. What was to be done? “Oh, dear, sir,” cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, “what ever shall we do?” “We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It’ll be a tough job, though. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him to go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we’ll have a try at the door.",0
"” Poirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up. “Soit!” he said. “Then I must speak for you.” Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again. “You? How can you speak? You do not know ” he broke off abruptly. Poirot turned to face us. “Mesdames and messieurs! I speak! Listen! I, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist’s shop, and purchased strychnine at six o’clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp, for at six o’clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm.",0
"“Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.” “Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?” “Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.",0
"""Psychoanalysis, what?” said Black, with visible alarm. “Oh, no,” said Poirot reassuringly. “You see, it is like this, I give you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the first one you think of. Shall we begin?” “All right,” said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy. “Note down the words, please, Hastings,” said Poirot. Then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him. “We will commence. Day.” There was a moment’s pause, and then Black replied: “Night.” As Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.",0
"” He took out the charred fragment we had found in the grate in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he had found it. “But possibly this is an old will?” “I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon.” “What?” “Impossible!” broke simultaneously from both men. Poirot turned to John. “If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to you.” “Oh, of course but I don’t see ” Poirot raised his hand. “Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.",0
"""Oh!"" I said, rather disappointed. ""And then?"" Poirot's eyes twinkled a little. ""And then I say to myself, 'since there is here something that I do not understand, it would be well that I should investigate the matter. I must not permit myself to be wholly engrossed by the Big Four.' Ah! we are just arriving. My little clothes brush, where does it hide itself? Here it is brush me down, I pray you, my friend, and then I will perform the same service for you.",0
"And when my aunt made up her mind to marry Amos Finn, who was a poor school teacher out West, my father was just mad! Said if he made his pile, as he seemed in a fair way to do, she’d never see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was that Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again. “The old man did pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into steel, and he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he made Wall Street sit up!” He paused. “Then he died last fall and I got the dollars.",0
"Davenheim would be absent posting a letter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!” “He might have seized his opportunity,” I suggested. “And the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s tools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with a penknife, bien entendu!” “Well, what about Number Two?” “You say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better of it is more likely to be the other way about.",0
"Perhaps all this is merely a legacy from one's short leaves in the war, when it seemed a matter of such importance to secure a place near the gangway, and to be amongst the first to disembark lest one should waste precious minutes of one's three or five days' leave. On this particular July morning, as I stood by the rail and watched the white cliffs of Dover drawing nearer, I marvelled at the passengers who could sit calmly in their chairs and never even raise their eyes for the first sight of their native land. Yet perhaps their case was different from mine.",0
"My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to the lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite window.",0
"She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.” Denise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him. “Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?” Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely: “I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it.",0
"And observe that ‘Peerage’ how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, method, which, as I have often told you, Hastings” “Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place. Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality. “Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too.",0
"The fellow is an absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He’s got a great black beard, and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned to him at once, took him on as secretary you know how she’s always running a hundred societies?” I nodded. “Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No doubt the fellow was very useful to her.",0
"""A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies from the village?” “Yes,” I said eagerly. “He has been here, then?” “Oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. More’n once too. Friend of yours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall you’m a pretty lot!” And he leered more jocosely than ever. “Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?” I asked, as carelessly as I could. He winked at me knowingly. “One does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal gentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I’m sure.” I walked on sharply.",0
"He devised for me a little bomb simple and easy to carry about one has but to throw it and poof, the smoke and then the unconsciousness. Immediately I blow a little whistle and straightway some of Japp's clever fellows who were watching the house here long before the boy arrived, and who managed to follow us all the way to Limehouse, came flying up and took charge of the situation."" ""But how was it you weren't unconscious too?"" ""Another piece of luck.",0
"""Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl. You’ll have to trust me and hope for the best. Of course, if you’re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that’s another matter.",0
"Not that she disbelieved in Tommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to whether anyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for the fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal. If they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would be well. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces of Mr. Brown already be assembling against them? Even that last picture of Tommy, revolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By now he might be overpowered, borne down by sheer force of numbers Tuppence mapped out her plan of campaign.",0
"“Miss Howard here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good Dorcas. And Annie. Bien! We must delay our proceedings a few minutes until Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.” Miss Howard rose immediately from her seat. “If that man comes into the house, I leave it!” “No, no!” Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice. Finally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes later Alfred Inglethorp entered the room. The company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a popular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.",0
"‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was perfect, the indulgent tone, the soupçon of sad mockery. At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great woman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!” Poirot lost himself in contemplation. “One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?” “You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be unrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track.",0
"“Well, I don’t know that I should go so far as to say that. But it’s certainly fortunate for all parties that we’ve managed to find the young lady.” “But where is she?” demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on another tack. “I thought you’d be sure to bring her along?” “That would hardly be possible,” said Sir James gravely. “Why?” “Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident, and has sustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to the infirmary, and on recovering consciousness gave her name as Jane Finn.",0
"Little by little the magic of the night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence sprang up with a cry. “I can’t help it. I know Mr. Brown’s somewhere in the flat! I can feel him.” “Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door’s open into the hall. No one could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing him.” “I can’t help it.",0
"English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.",0
"And so, when the time came, I had my little coup de théâtre all ready!"" ""You are wonderful, Poirot; absolutely wonderful!"" ""I was glad to do it, too. For I had admired the countess. I should have been sorry if she had perished in the explosion."" ""I've been half afraid to ask you what of the Big Four?"" ""All the bodies have now been recovered. That of Number Four was quite unrecognisable, the head blown to pieces. I wish I rather wish it had not been so. I should have liked to be sure but no more of that. Look at this."" He handed me a newspaper in which a paragraph was marked.",0
"” The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features, stepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of deference in his manner. Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion. “Why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings my husband.” I looked with some curiosity at “Alfred darling”. He certainly struck a rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen.",0
"But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner of a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert’s pocket, and the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good, and that the fish would rise to the bait. “American Detective Force!” she hissed. Albert fell for it. “Lord!” he murmured ecstatically. Tuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a thorough understanding. “Know who I’m after?” she inquired genially. Albert, still round-eyed, demanded breathlessly: “One of the flats?” Tuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs.",0
"“Good afternoon,” I said pleasantly. “Is Dr. Bauerstein in?” She stared at me. “Haven’t you heard?” “Heard what?” “About him.” “What about him?” “He’s took.” “Took? Dead?” “No, took by the perlice.” “By the police!” I gasped. “Do you mean they’ve arrested him?” “Yes, that’s it, and ” I waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot. To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London. I was dumbfounded.",0
"Been fooling them all the time, eh?” The girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into tears. Julius patted her on the shoulder. “There, there just you sit tight. We’re not going to let you quit.” Through her sobs the girl said indistinctly: “You’re from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me home-sick.” “Sure I’m from home. I’m your cousin Julius Hersheimmer. I came over to Europe on purpose to find you and a pretty dance you’ve led me.” The car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder: “Cross-roads here, sir. I’m not sure of the way.",0
"” But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest! There was a column of mere padding about “The Styles Poisoning Case,” but nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that, for some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrests to come.",0
"“You! What’s up? Surely you know the plan ” Kramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many unnecessary panics: “We have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save our own skins. The girl! And at once! It’s our only chance.” Whittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment. “You have orders from him?” “Naturally! Should I be here otherwise? Hurry! There is no time to be lost. The other little fool had better come too.” Whittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing minutes went by. Then two figures hastily huddled in cloaks appeared on the steps and were hustled into the car.",0
"""But quite unnecessary."" ""Unnecessary!"" I cried, amazed. ""If the man was poisoned "" ""Aha,"" cried Poirot, pouncing upon a note which lay on the table. ""From Japp. Just as I thought."" He flung it over to me. It was brief and to the point. No traces of poison had been found, and there was nothing to show how the man came by his death. ""You see,"" said Poirot, ""our questions would have been quite unnecessary."" ""You guessed this beforehand?"" ""'Forecast the probable result of the deal,'"" quoted Poirot from a recent Bridge problem on which I had spent much time. ""Mon ami, when you do that successfully, you do not call it guessing.",0
"""What is that?” “A mistake even a little mistake on the part of the murderer.” He stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and shook his head. “Monsieur,” he said to the manager, “explain to me, I pray, your system of serving meals here.” The manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall. “This is the service lift,” he explained. “It runs to the kitchens at the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and the dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic worries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant.",0
"’” “At expensive French watering-places?” “Dirt cheap if you know where to go.” I eyed her keenly. “Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?” “We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously. “There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime at the Villa Geneviève ?” She stared at me.",0
") Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.",0
"Now I ask you, Moosior Poirot, why wasn't he willing? Because he didn't want attention drawn to him. Didn't want somebody or other to get on his track. That's my solution Gilmour Wilson got pipped by mistake."" ""There is no one who has any private reason to gain by Savaronoff's death?"" ""Well, his niece, I suppose. He's recently come into an immense fortune. Left him by Madame Gospoja whose husband was a sugar profiteer under the old regime. They had an affair together once, I believe, and she refused steadfastly to credit the reports of his death."" ""Where did the match take place?"" ""In Savaronoff's own flat.",0
"But I shall be able to tell better when I’ve heard the whole story. Now, then, take a deep breath and start again. You went to Florence” “But I didn’t go to Florence. That is just it.” “Well, where did you go, then?” “I went home to Marlow.” “What the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?” “I wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting” “Your wife? But I didn’t know you were married?” “No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived you in this matter.” “How long have you been married?” “Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I became your secretary.",0
"Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle_ that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the devil Carton hid them if he did hide them, I don’t know.",0
"The doctor no longer practiced, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took a few private patients here the good fellow tapped his forehead knowingly “balmy ones! You understand!” The doctor was a popular figure in the village, subscribed freely to all the local sports “a very pleasant, affable gentleman.” Been there long? Oh, a matter of ten years or so might be longer. Scientific gentleman, he was. Professors and people often came down from town to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors. In the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts.",0
"” Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the moment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question. I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the Daily Budget.",0
"There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story, keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however insignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet. I told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words, of her husband’s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of conversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard, of the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of the latter’s innuendoes. I was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times, and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.",0
"” Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully. “Si, si, mon enfant I assure you it is better not to resist.” Then he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little experiment purely for my own satisfaction.” “Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally. Poirot addressed Célestine once more. “You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it?” “On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.” “And the scissors?” “They also.",0
"Our client was in such an agony of outraged propriety that no one could feel it necessary to ask exactly what she had seen in the garden. She had evidently seen quite enough to make up her own mind on the situation. ""The attacks got worse and worse. Dr. Treves said it was all perfectly natural and to be expected, and that Mr. Templeton could not possibly live long, but I've never seen anything like it before myself not in all my long experience of nursing. It seemed to me much more like some form of "" She paused, hesitating. ""Arsenical poisoning?"" said Poirot helpfully. She nodded. ""And then, too, he, the patient, I mean, said something queer.",0
"A crashing blow descended on his head, and all was darkness. WHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all Tuppence’s self-command to refrain from accompanying him. However, she contained herself as best she might, consoled by the reflection that her reasoning had been justified by events. The two men had undoubtedly come from the second floor flat, and that one slender thread of the name “Rita” had set the Young Adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of Jane Finn. The question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the grass grow under her feet.",0
"Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee on reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had played her the same trick. “What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say that Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she heated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced with a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The coffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven and nine o’clock that evening.",0
"“Afraid you might be late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!” said Mr. Beresford. “And really and truly,” continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide, “I haven’t got anything smaller than a five-pound note.” “You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the fellow wasn’t taken in not for a moment!” “No,” said Tuppence thoughtfully, “he didn’t believe it. That’s the curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found that out this morning. Now let’s go to lunch. How about the Savoy?” Tommy grinned.",0
"I could return, unsuspected, and work havoc in their midst. There was now nothing to hinder my immediate departure. I sent off cables, booked my passage, and one week later found me embarking in the Ansonia en route for Buenos Ayres. Just as the boat left the quay, a steward brought me a note. It had been given him, so he explained, by a big gentleman in a fur coat who had left the boat last thing before the gangway planks were lifted. I opened it. It was terse and to the point. ""You are wise,"" it ran. It was signed with a big figure 4.",0
"It was clear, on the other hand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with the loss of the other’s company. “I guess there’s nothing complicated about this deal,” he remarked. “Just a game of hide-and-seek, that’s all.” “I hope so,” said Sir James. “Sure thing. What else could it be?” “You are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will probably have learnt one lesson. ‘Never underestimate your adversary.’” The gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect upon Julius. “You think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he does, I’m ready for him.” He slapped his pocket.",0
"Why?” “Because for the last two months I’ve been making a sentimental idiot of myself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her photograph my heart did all the usual stunts you read about in novels. I guess I’m ashamed to admit it, but I came over here determined to find her and fix it all up, and take her back as Mrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!” “Oh!” said Tommy, amazed. Julius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued: “Just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One look at the girl in the flesh, and I was cured!” Feeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated “Oh!” again.",0
"In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin.",0
"Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you need have no fear for yourself” I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face “you are not threatened. Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr. Milray wishes me to accompany you.",0
"I hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he negatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners he was sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he could not have failed to observe them. I do not know what put the idea into my head possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones but I asked suddenly: “Young M. Renauld he did not leave by that train, did he?” “Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour, it would not be amusing, that!” I stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.",0
"As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put me on to a very good thing, and well, I have money to burn, as the saying goes. I think a week-end at the Grand Metropolitan would do us all the good in the world.” “Thank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.” I did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.",0
"Why attempt the impossible? Put as delicately as possible, his opinion amounted to this: If Poirot, the unique Poirot, had failed, was it likely that I should succeed? But I was obstinate. Putting aside any question as to whether I had the necessary qualifications for the task (and I may say in passing that I did not entirely agree with his views on this point), I had worked so long with Poirot that I knew his methods by heart, and felt fully capable of taking up the work where he had laid it down; it was, with me, a question of feeling.",0
"Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil. Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs. I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction.",0
"Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.",0
"Vandemeyer with us if necessary. You understand?” “Yes.” Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. “Oh, I feel so much better!” “Don’t build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.” Julius turned to the lawyer. “Say, then. I’ll call for you in the car round about nine-thirty. Is that right?” “Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to have two cars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to you is to go and have a good dinner, a really good one, mind. And don’t think ahead more than you can help.” He shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were outside.",0
"Several big blue motor-cars were waiting in the central square of the town, and we three got into one of them. Poirot, notwithstanding the heat of the day, was muffled to the eyes in greatcoat and scarf. His eyes and the tips of his ears were all that could be seen of him. I did not know whether this was due to precaution or merely his exaggerated fear of catching a chill. The motor journey took a couple of hours. It was a really wonderful drive. For the first part of the way we wound in and out of huge cliffs, with a trickling waterfall on one hand.",0
"In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside.",0
"And finally we have boiled the whole thing down to four names. Here they are, my friend."" He tossed me over a sheet of paper. I read its contents aloud. ""Ernest Luttrell. Son of a North Country parson. Always had a kink of some kind in his moral make-up. Was expelled from his public school. Went on the stage at the age of twenty-three.

Age 32, height 5 ft. 10-1/2 in., clean-shaven, hair brown, nose straight, complexion fair, eyes gray. ""John St.",0
"But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.",0
"Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.” “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr.",0
"” There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could “fell” an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela.” Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair.",0
"I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean the opposite?” “Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.” “Brachycephalic,” I murmured unwillingly. “That’s it. I thought that was what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said with all the assurance I could muster. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she laughed. “You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.",0
"” To my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a “funny dear.” “It’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, “but you know you don’t want to!” “Yes, I do. I’ve got ” “Never mind what you’ve got. You don’t really want to and I don’t either.” “Well, of course, that settles it,” I said stiffly. “But I don’t see anything to laugh at. There’s nothing funny about a proposal.” “No, indeed,” said Cynthia. “Somebody might accept you next time. Good-bye, you’ve cheered me up very much.” And, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished through the trees.",0
"The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid a master stroke, ça!” “But what did you go to London for?” “You remember the card?” “Certainly. It puzzled me and puzzles me still. I thought” I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. “Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints.",0
"Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot so and I say: the Prime Minister is there! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.” And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener.",0
"Inglethorp arrested now? That should have conveyed something to you.” “Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?” “Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp’s death, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away from that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no idea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of Mr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it. When I arrived at the château, I realized at once that it was Mrs.",0
"Then there was a stir of draperies behind us, and the Countess Vera Rossakoff came in. ""Ah!"" said Number Four. ""Our valued and trusted lieutenant. An old friend of yours is here, my dear lady."" The countess whirled round with her usual vehemence of movement. ""God in Heaven!"" she cried. ""It is the little man! Ah! but he has the nine lives of a cat! Oh, little man, little man! Why did you mix yourself up in this?"" ""Madame,"" said Poirot, with a bow. ""Me, like the great Napoleon, I am on the side of the big battalions.",0
"He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch.",0
"“He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks him down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and find Pagett lying there. How’s that?” “You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.",0
"Since we had come into contact with the Big Four, they had committed two murders, abducted Halliday, and had been within an ace of killing Poirot and myself; whereas so far we had hardly scored a point in the game. Poirot treated my complaints lightly. ""So far, Hastings,"" he said, ""they laugh. That is true, but you have a proverb, have you not: 'He laughs best who laughs at the end'? And at the end, mon ami, you shall see. ""You must remember, too,"" he added, ""that we deal with no ordinary criminal, but with the second greatest brain in the world."" I forbore to pander to his conceit by asking the obvious question.",0
"He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities. Your name?” “Gabriel Stonor.” “How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?” “About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met him through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering good boss he was too.” “Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?” “Yes, a good bit.",0
"""They've let us alone, anyway,"" I observed. ""There have been no more attempts on your life, and no ambushes of any kind."" ""No,"" said Poirot thoughtfully. ""On the whole, that rather surprises me. Especially as there are one or two fairly obvious ways of getting at us which I should have thought certain to have occurred to them. You catch my meaning, perhaps?"" ""An infernal machine of some kind?"" I hazarded. Poirot made a sharp click with his tongue expressive of impatience. ""But no! I appeal to your imagination, and you can suggest nothing more subtle than bombs in the fireplace.",0
"The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios. His name was Ned perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue.",0
"So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but ” She interrupted me. “Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all ” “It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know what he said?” “No?” “‘Hell!’ said the Prince and kissed her!” And I suited the action to the word. I was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on the street below. “That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath. “What is, mon ami?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of his comfortable chair.",0
"It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still roll. Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.",0
"I feel the same.” “It’s it’s so lovely to think of things and then for them really to happen!” cried Tuppence enthusiastically. Her hand was still in Tommy’s. They had reached the entrance hall. There were footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices. Suddenly, to Tommy’s complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into the little space by the side of the lift where the shadow was deepest. “What the ” “Hush!” Two men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance. Tuppence’s hand closed tighter on Tommy’s arm. “Quick follow them. I daren’t. He might recognize me.",0
"We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned. You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. Later. Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot.",0
"He seemed lost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme mental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in doubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and turning to Japp, he asked: “Have you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim occupied the same bedroom?” The question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. “Good Lord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something startling.",0
"At the sight of her son, standing between the two myrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified. “Jack,” she faltered. “Jack, what is this?” He looked up at her, his face set. “They have arrested me, mother.” “What?” She uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait.",0
"It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot.",0
"I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out the key before leaving the room.” “Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?” “No, right the other side of the room. Why?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?” We had reached the cottage. “No. I think I’ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way through the woods.” The woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the open park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades. There was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was faint and subdued.",0
"One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.” “Well?” “Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday, and that a convoy coming in unexpectedly she had kindly offered to remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That disposes of that.” “Oh!” I said, rather nonplussed. “Really,” I continued, “it’s her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her. I can’t help feeling she’d do anything against him. And I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will.",0
"Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time, as she dealt with Coot’s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.” “Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her death?” “Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.” The same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error. “That, of course, is always possible,” replied the doctor.",0
"They tortured you with a lie!"" I turned my head aside. Poirot put his hand on my shoulder. There was something in his voice that I had never heard there before. ""You like not that I should embrace you or display the emotion, I know well. I will be very British. I will say nothing but nothing at all. Only this that in this last adventure of ours, the honours are all with you, and happy is the man who has such a friend as I have!"" I was very disappointed with the results of Poirot's bomb attack on the premises in Chinatown. To begin with, the leader of the gang had escaped.",0
"“Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly.",0
"Ah, here's Micky!"" A shambling young man entered the room. He had a very round face, and foolish-looking eyebrows raised as though in perpetual surprise. He grinned awkwardly as he shook hands. This was clearly the ""wanting"" son. Presently we all went in to dinner. Dr. Treves left the room to open some wine, I think -and suddenly the boy's physiognomy underwent a startling change. He leant forward, staring at Poirot. ""You've come about father,"" he said, nodding his head. ""I know. I know lots of things but nobody thinks I do.",0
"""You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines.",0
"I will rejoin you later.” It was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders.",0
"I turned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an interest in his story. “Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me.",0
"“Telephone message just come for you, sir.” Whittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his brow. “That’ll do, Brown. You can go.” The clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington turned to Tuppence. “Come to-morrow at the same time. I’m busy now. Here’s fifty to go on with.” He rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the table to Tuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to go. The girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them in her handbag, and rose. “Good morning, Mr. Whittington,” she said politely.",0
"Is that a bargain?” “That’s a bargain,” said Japp heartily. “And, on behalf of the Yard, I’m much obliged to you, though I’m bound to confess I can’t at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always were a marvel! So long, then, moosier.” The two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on his face. “Well, my friend,” cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, “what do you think? Mon Dieu! I had some warm moments in that court; I did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say anything at all.",0
"I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before that time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters the room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys they were all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case it is locked, and the keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had hoped.",0
"“You thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally certain of his identity for some time ever since the night of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s mysterious death.” “Ah!” breathed Tuppence. “For there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only two solutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own hand, which theory I reject utterly, or else ” “Yes?” “Or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only three people touched that brandy you, Miss Tuppence, I myself, and one other Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!” Jane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide astonished eyes.",0
"""Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door. Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen. “This necklace it was, without doubt, insured?” Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question. “Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.” “But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.” “I comprehend, madame,” said Poirot soothingly. “I comprehend perfectly.",0
"""I’m sure of that.” Japp lowered his voice. “I’m much obliged to you. A pretty mare’s nest arresting him would have been.” He turned to Inglethorp. “But, if you’ll excuse me, sir, why couldn’t you say all this at the inquest?” “I will tell you why,” interrupted Poirot. “There was a certain rumour ” “A most malicious and utterly untrue one,” interrupted Alfred Inglethorp in an agitated voice. “And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at present. Am I right?” “Quite right.” Inglethorp nodded.",0
"At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot: “Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.” Dumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath. “He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something in it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don’t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up right away, and take another look at her.” But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind.",0
"She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!” “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!” “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.” “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.” “Mon Dieu! but how you enrage yourself for nothing, mon ami!” “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door.",0
"This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with your head if I’m at all displeased with you!’ Miss Cynthia, she was what they call an Apache, or some such name a Frenchified sort of cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You’d never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.” “These evenings must have been great fun,” said Poirot genially. “I suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he was Shah of Persia?” “He did have a beard, sir,” replied Dorcas, smiling.",0
"All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then.",0
"A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories.",0
"""Behind what?"" ""Everything. The world-wide unrest, the labour troubles that beset every nation, and the revolutions that break out in some. There are people, not scaremongers, who know what they are talking about, and they say that there is a force behind the scenes which aims at nothing less than the disintegration of civilisation. In Russia, you know, there were many signs that Lenin and Trotsky were mere puppets whose every action was dictated by another's brain. I have no definite proof that would count with you, but I am quite convinced that this brain was Li Chang Yen's.",0
"He leaned forward and hissed savagely: “So that’s your little game, is it?” Tuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally quick-witted, and felt it imperative to “keep her end up” as she phrased it. Whittington went on: “Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse? Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that it, eh?” He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. “Who’s been blabbing? Rita?” Tuppence shook her head.",0
"Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.” “Very clever,” interpolated the Count approvingly. “The ‘Colonel’ is always clever. Well, I did my part but I also did one thing which the ‘Colonel’ had not foreseen. I kept back some of the South American stones one or two are unique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beer’s hands. With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter is bound to be suspected.",0
"Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well I warned you.",0
"In a few minutes the little doctor came hurrying towards them. “Can you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?” said Sir James pleasantly. “Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you already know.” A quizzical gleam came into the doctor’s eye as he shook hands with Julius. “Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right, eh?” “I guess it’s cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc.” “And the heart trouble? Ha ha!” “Still searching,” said Julius briefly. “To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?” asked Sir James. “Certainly.",0
"Also, by this ” And, leaning forward, he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see. It was a woman’s long black hair similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. Eh bien, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud.",0
"Know the road at all?” “Yes, sir, it will be about an hour and a half’s run.” “Make it an hour. I’m in a hurry.” “I’ll do my best, sir.” The car shot forward through the traffic. Julius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim. He kept his hand in the pocket of his coat, but his manner was urbane to the last degree. “There was a man I shot once in Arizona ” he began cheerfully. At the end of the hour’s run the unfortunate Kramenin was more dead than alive. In succession to the anecdote of the Arizona man, there had been a tough from ‘Frisco, and an episode in the Rockies.",0
"Rapidly, I considered it. The light increased. Poirot’s mysterious doings, his hints they all fitted in. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and what a relief for us all. “No, John,” I said, “it isn’t one of us. How could it be?” “I know, but, still, who else is there?” “Can’t you guess?” “No.” I looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice. “Dr. Bauerstein!” I whispered. “Impossible!” “Not at all.” “But what earthly interest could he have in my mother’s death?” “That I don’t see,” I confessed, “but I’ll tell you this: Poirot thinks so.",0
"… “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before. If it was not Bella Duveen, the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one single proof against her! “And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea since, as she thought, it belonged to her sister.",0
"She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness. “Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen’s room.” The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife’s room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered. As she was about to depart Poirot detained her. “One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen a card like this?” He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully. “No, sir, I can’t say I have.",0
"""Then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.” “I’ve got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know, and sent it to Mr. Carter. I got his reply this morning, and among other things it encloses the official statement of those saved from the Lusitania. How’s that for clever little Tuppence?” “Full marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point is, is there a ‘Rita’ on the list?” “That’s just what I don’t know,” confessed Tuppence. “Don’t know?” “Yes. Look here.” Together they bent over the list. “You see, very few Christian names are given.",0
"“Paris.” “Oh!” said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: “Of course, if father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I don’t see Mr. Whittington in the role of the gay deceiver.” “Yes,” continued Whittington. “What could be more delightful? To put the clock back a few years a very few, I am sure and re-enter one of those charming pensionnats de jeunes filles with which Paris abounds ” Tuppence interrupted him. “A pensionnat?” “Exactly. Madame Colombier’s in the Avenue de Neuilly.” Tuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more select. She had had several American friends there.",0
"“Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered.",0
"“Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?” “Of course I remember.” “I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.” “Was that what you meant?” “Of course.” I hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained. He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: “When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted me. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing.",0
"Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the result. The minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return. “Curious,” I remarked, at length. “I wonder when they will come back.” Poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said thoughtfully: “They will not come back.” “Why?” “Because, my friend, something has happened.” “What sort of thing? How do you know?” I asked curiously. Poirot smiled. “A few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs. He was much agitated.",0
"“Well?” I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen. With a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The sunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair to quivering gold. “Mr. Hastings you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.” It struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming girl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind. “Well?” I asked benignantly, as she hesitated. “I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?” “Do?” “Yes.",0
"I asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my intense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely likely to be acquitted. “But, Poirot ” I protested. “Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs. It is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another matter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little evidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I lack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing link ” He shook his head gravely.",0
"Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably.",0
"Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks alias the Rev. Edward Chichester alias Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: “I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me.",0
"Disdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy’s pencil which she had retained and wrote rapidly: “Don’t put in advertisement. Will explain to-morrow.” She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one short month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his subscription. “It may catch him,” she murmured. “Anyway, it’s worth trying.” After handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping at a baker’s to buy three penny-worth of new buns.",0
"There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls! This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness.",0
"“No disparagement to Jane, mind you,” continued the other. “She’s a real nice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her right away.” “I thought her a very good-looking girl,” said Tommy, finding his tongue. “Sure she is. But she’s not like her photo one bit. At least I suppose she is in a way must be because I recognized her right off. If I’d seen her in a crowd I’d have said ‘There’s a girl whose face I know’ right away without any hesitation.",0
"""Well then, Poirot,"" I argued, ""why did he run the risk of coming at all. If he intended to return later for the body, I can see some point in his visit. He would at least be removing the evidence against himself; as it is, he does not seem to have gained anything."" Poirot shrugged his most Gallic shrug. ""But you do not see with the eyes of Number Four, Hastings,"" he said. ""You talk of evidence, but what evidence have we against him? True, we have a body, but we have no proof even that the man was murdered prussic acid, when inhaled, leaves no trace.",0
"He never hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring trick. “What a steady hand you’ve got,” I remarked. “I believe I’ve only seen your hand shake once.” “On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,” observed Poirot, with great placidity. “Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I must say ” But I stopped suddenly.",0
"I had an advertisement to this effect inserted in a number of morning newspapers, and I was sitting in a small restaurant in Soho, and judging of the effect of the advertisement, when a small paragraph in another part of the paper gave me a nasty shock. Very briefly, it reported the mysterious disappearance of Mr. John Ingles from the S.S. Shanghai shortly after the latter had left Marseilles. Although the weather was perfectly smooth, it was feared that the unfortunate gentleman must have fallen overboard. The paragraph ended with a brief reference to Mr. Ingles's long and distinguished service in China.",0
"“No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will. But I can tell you this much it was not in Miss Howard’s favour.” I accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be so positive about the matter. “Well,” I said, with a sigh, “we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is partly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said about her evidence at the inquest that set me off.” Poirot looked puzzled. “What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?” “Don’t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above suspicion?” “Oh ah yes.",0
"“Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it and the wonder, I shall not forget no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “Mon ami,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well.",0
"As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled. “That’s a pretty girl,” I remarked appreciatively. John’s face hardened. “That is Mrs. Raikes.” “The one that Miss Howard ” “Exactly,” said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness. I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me. I brushed it aside. “Styles is really a glorious old place,” I said to John. He nodded rather gloomily.",0
"I will take the latch-key.” To make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the first floor of Styles. The servants’ rooms are reached through the door B. They have no communication with the right wing, where the Inglethorps’ rooms were situated. [Illustration] It seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence Cavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face told me at once that something was seriously wrong. “What’s the matter?” I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect my scattered thoughts. “We are afraid my mother is very ill.",0
"Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my mind, but I can’t see how it has anything to do with the matter?” He was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he said: “I do not mind telling you though, as you know, it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs. Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her coffee.” “Yes?” “Well, what time was the coffee served?” “About eight o’clock.” “Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight certainly not much later.",0
"How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death.",0
"Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest.",0
"“Come, come, mon ami. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! Bien! All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.” It was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught. “I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that” Poirot held up his hand. “My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.",0
"""What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference.",0
"They say Peel Edgerton can smell a criminal! How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you? Perhaps even now his suspicions are aroused. He guesses ” Mrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully. “Reassure yourself, my dear Boris. He suspects nothing. With less than your usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a beautiful woman. I assure you that is all that interests Peel Edgerton.” Boris shook his head doubtfully. “He has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied it. Do you fancy that you can deceive him?” Mrs. Vandemeyer’s eyes narrowed.",0
"“What is it?” “The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?” “No, I didn’t.” “You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore false to all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I asked, not particularly interested in Poirot’s principles.",0
"I can’t help feeling responsible for his death. It will haunt me for ever!” “No, no,” I said soothingly. “Of course it’s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,” resumed Jack, “but I’d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and realized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so honestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself.",0
"But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M.",0
"I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.",0
"Hercule Poirot, 14 Farraway Street."" Poirot tried him with several questions. Sometimes the man did not answer at all; sometimes he repeated the same phrase. Poirot made a sign to me to ring up on the telephone. ""Get Dr. Ridgeway to come round."" The doctor was in luckily; and as his house was only just round the corner, few minutes elapsed before he came bustling in. ""What's all this, eh?"" Poirot gave a brief explanation, and the doctor started examining our strange visitor, who seemed quite unconscious of his presence or ours. ""H'm!"" said Dr. Ridgeway, when he had finished.",0
"She’s a wrong ‘un, that’s what she is. Swell clothes, but no class. Cook knows something about her but she won’t tell scared to death of her. And suspicious! She’s on to you in a minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you ” But what more Annie could tell, Tuppence was never destined to learn, for at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely ring to it called: “Annie!” The smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot. “Yes, ma’am.” “Who are you talking to?” “It’s a young woman about the situation, ma’am.” “Show her in then.",0
"I can alter my appearance a little wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window.",0
"""Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?” “I really do not remember hearing anything.” “Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?” “Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.” A faint spot of colour came into her cheek. “I am not in the habit of listening to private conversations.” The Coroner persisted. “And you remember nothing at all? Nothing, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it was a private conversation?” She paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever. “Yes; I remember.",0
"” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you ” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed.",0
"” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil.",0
"“There was something in that case some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk, of coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it, thus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have been something of great importance.” “But what was it?” “Ah!” cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger.",0
"” Poirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked than ever. “So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil murdered M. Renauld?” “Yes.” “Why?” He shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback. “Why?” I stammered. “Why? Oh, because ” I came to a stop. Poirot nodded his head at me. “You see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame Daubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld? We can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death; considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You cannot have a murder without a motive.",0
"When you got called to this job, did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed up in it?” “No, but ” “If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the same as I am? Of course you would.” “I’m a man. You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you will show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated.",0
"Should I mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. “Mrs. Blair, for one,” I said lightly. “A friend of mine with whom I am staying.” “I think not,” said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. “You have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.” His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed, but I was not going to give in without a fight. “You are very clever,” I said. “Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone? Mrs.",0
"Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them. Rolf nodded to us as we entered. “We’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it’s almost unbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can’t think.” A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit.",0
"As the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn sat up with a start. “Have we arrived? I never thought we should!” “Oh, I thought we’d get to London all right. If there’s going to be any fun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We’ll nip into a taxi.” In another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the necessary fares, and were stepping into a taxi. “King’s Cross,” directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man looked in at the window, just as they started. She was almost certain it was the same man who had got into the carriage next to them.",0
"'"" ""Perhaps you'll meet him in Paris,"" I said, knowing that he referred to a certain Giraud, one of the most trusted detectives of the Sureté, whom he had met on a previous occasion. Poirot made a grimace. ""I devoutly hope not. He loved me not, that one."" ""Won't it be a very difficult task?"" I asked. ""To find out what an unknown Englishman did on an evening two months ago?"" ""Very difficult, mon ami. But, as you know well, difficulties rejoice the heart of Hercule Poirot."" ""You think the Big Four kidnapped him?"" Poirot nodded.",0
"“I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not.",0
"Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face. He was thoroughly taken aback. What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room.",0
"‘Twould need a lot of money spent on it.” “Thanks,” said Tommy cheerily. “I dare say it’ll be a washout, but houses are scarce nowadays.” “That they are,” declared the woman heartily. “My daughter and son-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don’t know how long. It’s all the war. Upset things terribly, it has. But excuse me, sir, it’ll be too dark for you to see much of the house. Hadn’t you better wait until to-morrow?” “That’s all right. We’ll have a look around this evening, anyway. We’d have been here before only we lost our way.",0
"“I thought you’d hear sense. Where is the girl?” “At Gatehouse, in Kent. Astley Priors, the place is called.” “Is she a prisoner there?” “She’s not allowed to leave the house though it’s safe enough really. The little fool has lost her memory, curse her!” “That’s been annoying for you and your friends, I reckon. What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?” “She’s there too,” said the Russian sullenly. “That’s good,” said Julius. “Isn’t it all panning out beautifully? And a lovely night for the run!” “What run?” demanded Kramenin, with a stare.",0
"Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?” “Oh!” I said, bewildered. “Exactly,” said Poirot, beaming. “We start again.” He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience.",0
"Quentin first saw his patient, he was mystified by some of the symptoms. He had only attended him once before the night when he was sent for after dinner. As soon as he was alone with Mr. Paynter, the latter had unfolded a surprising tale. To begin with, he was not feeling ill at all, he explained, but the taste of some curry that he had been eating at dinner had struck him as peculiar. Making an excuse to get rid of Ah Ling for a few minutes, he had turned the contents of his plate into a bowl, and he now handed it over to the doctor with injunctions to find out if there were really anything wrong with it.",0
"I never said a word but many's the time I smiled to myself. Bless you, he never knew he was doing it even."" Poirot nodded gently. I noticed that his own hand was shaking a little as he stretched it out to his glass. ""Then there is always handwriting as a means of establishing identity,"" he remarked. ""Without doubt you have preserved a letter written by Mr. Darrell?"" Flossie Monro shook her head regretfully. ""He was never one for writing. Never wrote me a line in his life."" ""That is a pity,"" said Poirot. ""I tell you what, though,"" said Miss Monro suddenly.",0
"You have lived for two years with Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs. Vandemeyer can apply to her for a reference. “May I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to the truth as possible it minimizes the danger of ‘slips.’ I suggest that you should represent yourself to be what you are, a former V.A.D., who has chosen domestic service as a profession. There are many such at the present time. That explains away any incongruities of voice or manner which otherwise might awaken suspicion. “Whichever way you decide, good luck to you. “Your sincere friend, “MR. CARTER.",0
"“But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!” It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids. The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot.",0
"It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you ” “I know I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still ” I began, and stopped. “Still as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing.",0
"I had been madly in love with her for the moment I even think that I frightened her sometimes but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead.",0
"” The Russian remained mute, still livid with terror. “But what made them let us go?” demanded Tuppence suspiciously. “I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just couldn’t refuse!” This was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently: “Curse you curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My life won’t be safe for an hour in this country.” “That’s so,” assented Julius. “I’d advise you to make tracks for Russia right away.” “Let me go, then,” cried the other. “I have done what you asked.",0
"We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds. Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke. “I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.” The girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall. “Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.” But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle.",0
"It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter.",0
"""Art?” “Why, yes. What’s the difficulty? Hire a liner ” “A liner!” murmured Dr. Hall faintly. “Hire some passengers, hire a submarine that’s the only difficulty, I guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hide-bound over their engines of war. They won’t sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word ‘graft,’ sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that we shan’t really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane.",0
"“Excuse me,” it said. “But may I speak to you for a moment?” TUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue remained unspoken, for the man’s appearance and manner did not bear out her first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her thoughts, the man said quickly: “I can assure you I mean no disrespect.” Tuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him instinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down.",0
"Now it appears that one of your British scientists read a paper upon the subject before the British Association. His colleagues didn't think great shakes of it, by all accounts, thought it farfetched and fanciful, but your scientist stuck to his guns, and declared that he himself was on the eve of success in his experiments."" ""Eh, bien?"" demanded Poirot, with interest. ""It was suggested that I should come over here and get an interview with this gentleman. Quite a young fellow, he is, Halliday by name.",0
"""Here comes our friend the Inspector. It is well. I have seen all I want to see here."" He drummed on the table absent-mindedly, as though absorbed in calculation, and then asked suddenly, ""What is the day of the week, mon ami?"" ""Monday,"" I said, rather astonished. ""What ?"" ""Ah! Monday, is it? A bad day of the week. To commit a murder on a Monday is a mistake."" Passing back to the living-room, he tapped the glass on the wall and glanced at the thermometer. ""Set fair, and seventy degrees Fahrenheit. An orthodox English summer's day.",0
"Of course, if the girl was really Whittington’s niece, she might be too cute to fall into the trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire to Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained foot, and telling him to come down if he wasn’t busy. I had to be guarded in what I said. However, I didn’t hear from him, and my foot soon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I said good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if he heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss Tuppence, you’re looking mighty pale!” “It’s Tommy,” said Tuppence.",0
"After a minute or two he said: ""That is not exactly the point I had in mind, Hastings. If only one window was open it would not intrigue me so much. It is both windows being open that strikes me as curious."" He hurried into the other room. ""The sitting-room window is open, too. That also we left shut. Ah!"" He bent over the dead man, examining the corners of the mouth minutely. Then he looked up suddenly. ""He has been gagged, Hastings. Gagged and then poisoned."" ""Good heavens!"" I exclaimed, shocked. ""I suppose we shall find out all about it from the post-mortem."" ""We shall find out nothing. He was killed by inhaling strong prussic acid.",0
"It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition a je ne sais quoi!” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side.",0
"And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament.",0
"“It’s a very delicate affair, and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not, and then where shall I be? I don’t believe one of you has got an ounce of tact.” The German rapped the table. “Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!” Tommy leaned back wearily. “I like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But one thing is essential, I must see the girl.” “What girl?” “Jane Finn, of course.” The other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said slowly, and as though choosing his words with care: “Do you not know that she can tell you nothing?” Tommy’s heart beat a little faster.",0
"He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “Eh ma foi! and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle. “You would have had Maître Grosíer’s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on.” “He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he worried me horribly. You see, I couldn’t very well take him into my confidence.",0
"For a moment she struggled for self-control, and then abandoning all presence, she held it to her lips and burst into a fit of sobbing. “Oh, Tommy, Tommy,” she cried, “I do love you so and I may never see you again” At the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and pushed back her hair. “That’s that,” she observed sternly. “Let’s look facts in the face. I seem to have fallen in love with an idiot of a boy who probably doesn’t care two straws about me.” Here she paused.",0
"My friend threw me a glance of dignified reproach. ""There are some jests that you should not permit yourself, Hastings,"" he said sententiously. ""Have I not saved an innocent man from being sent to the gallows? That is enough for one day."" Personally, I don't think that, even when a jury had acquitted Robert Grant, alias Biggs, of the murder of Jonathan Whalley, Inspector Meadows was entirely convinced of his innocence.",0
"""My little joke that was all. I like to play you the trick, see you."" We went out upon an amicable understanding. The following morning saw us wending our way to Dr. Savaronoff's flat in Westminster. ""Sonia Daviloff,"" I mused. ""It's a pretty name."" Poirot stopped, and threw me a look of despair. ""Always looking for romance! You are incorrigible. It would serve you right if Sonia Daviloff turned out to be our friend and enemy the Countess Vera Rossakoff."" At the mention of the countess, my face clouded over. ""Surely, Poirot, you don't suspect "" ""But, no, no. It was a joke! I have not the Big Four on the brain to that extent, whatever Japp may say."" The door of the flat was opened to us by a man-servant with a peculiarly wooden face.",0
"I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue.",0
What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road he might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain matters. At this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the corner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would they hail it? He drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged.,0
"I see everything now.” “If that is indeed the truth, I congratulate you, mon ami. For as a rule you are not famous for seeing eh, is it not so?” I felt a little annoyed. “Come now, don’t rub it in. You’ve been so confoundedly mysterious all along with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might fail to see what you were driving at.” Poirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then he looked up. “And since you see everything now, mon ami, what exactly is it that you see?” “Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld.",0
"His accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now, for, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have been cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.” “Perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?” “Then why did he not do so? He merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing more. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the truth.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the clock, “I suppose we’d better start for the station.",0
"Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave on the corridor. I turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on my lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man’s face. He was white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or some such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall.",0
"Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, c’est l’Anglais! Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age.",0
"I wanted to offer a big reward for news of Jane some days ago, but your crusted institution of Scotland Yard advised me against it. Said it was undesirable.” “They were probably right,” said Sir James dryly. “But it’s all O.K. about Julius,” put in Tuppence. “He’s not pulling your leg. He’s got simply pots of money.” “The old man piled it up in style,” explained Julius. “Now, let’s get down to it. What’s your idea?” Sir James considered for a moment or two. “There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.” He turned to Tuppence. “Is Mrs.",0
"I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton.",0
"""Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate ” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it.",0
"” Poirot paused, and then added softly: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.” “Mrs. Robinson!” I gasped. “Well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended Poirot. “Also, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, mon ami, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below armed with that excellent revolver of yours, bien entendu!” “Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm.",0
"Together they drag him into the shed as we know, the event had occurred just outside and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no resemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French type. That is sufficient. “I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot from the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The identification must rest solely on Madame Renauld’s evidence. Jack Renauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must be got out of the way.",0
"She was very generous, but she always wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for them and, that way she missed love. Don’t think she ever realized it, though, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different footing. I took my stand from the first. ‘So many pounds a year I’m worth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides not a pair of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ She didn’t understand was very offended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn’t that but I couldn’t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect.",0
"One comes to hold life and death very lightly.” “Yes,” I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do though they are, I suppose.",0
"But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.",0
"He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate.",0
"It was stuck there by the man who took out the photograph, the man who was here before us, but knew that we should come, and so left this for us Claud Darrell alias Number Four!"" It was after the tragic death of Miss Flossie Monro that I began to be aware of a change in Poirot. Up to now, his invincible confidence in himself had stood the test. But it seemed as though, at last, the long strain was beginning to tell. His manner was grave and brooding, and his nerves were on edge. In these days he was as jumpy as a cat.",0
"""I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.” “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway” “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen.",0
"Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize ” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully. “All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study.",0
"Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly not remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed to her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed inquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House that day? Again they met with no success. Julius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal.",0
"Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him to catch it.",0
"""Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted.",0
"On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser.",0
"CARTER, “Something’s turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may be simply making an awful ass of myself, but I don’t think so. If my conclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a plant. The whole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with the object of making us think the game was up therefore I fancy that we must have been pretty hot on the scent. “I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I’ve even got an idea where the papers are. That last’s only a guess, of course, but I’ve a sort of feeling it’ll turn out right. Anyhow, I enclose it in a sealed envelope for what it’s worth.",0
"Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur.",0
"“And no idea of saying good-bye politely to the ladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.” For the first time the girl spoke. “How did you ‘persuade’ him?” she asked. Julius tapped his revolver. “Little Willie here takes the credit!” “Splendid!” cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her eyes looked admiringly at Julius. “Annette and I didn’t know what was going to happen to us,” said Tuppence. “Old Whittington hurried us off. We thought it was lambs to the slaughter.” “Annette,” said Julius. “Is that what you call her?” His mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea.",0
"Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.” “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.” “What?” “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.” He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending. He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass.",0
"I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and said: “Come out at once, please,” in an acid voice. There was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He did not move. “Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What am I to do?” Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor. Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough. He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade a nasty deep wound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it.",0
"""I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a good-looking one,” replied Tuppence calmly. “On these technical points I bow to your decision,” murmured Mr. Beresford. “Now, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.” “How do you make that out?” “If she wasn’t, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the papers?” “Correct. Proceed, O Sherlock!” “Now there’s just a chance, I admit it’s only a chance, that this woman may have been ‘Rita.’” “And if so?” “If so, we’ve got to hunt through the survivors of the Lusitania till we find her.",0
"You can understand that we must lose no time if we are not already too late.” The manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered the flat. We passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the right of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod. “The dining-room.” Dr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we entered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though their occupants had just risen.",0
"In return for such service Japp supplied full details of any case which he thought might interest the little Belgian, and when he was put in charge of what the newspaper called ""The Yellow Jasmine Mystery,"" he wired Poirot, asking him whether he would care to come down and look into the case. It was in response to this wire that, about a month after my adventure in Abe Ryland's house, we found ourselves alone in a railway compartment whirling away from the smoke and dust of London, bound for the little town of Market Handford in Worcestershire, the seat of the mystery. Poirot leant back in his corner.",0
"That is to say they would emerge were it not for Hercule Poirot."" ""Do you seriously believe all this, Poirot? What about the armies and general machinery of civilisation?"" ""What about it in Russia, Hastings? This will be Russia on an infinitely larger scale and with this additional menace that Madame Olivier's experiments have proceeded further than she has ever given out. I believe that she has, to a certain extent, succeeded in liberating atomic energy and harnessing it to her purpose.",0
"I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me.",0
"""Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain.",0
"Hastings,” she said, “do you think I and my husband are happy together?” I was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it’s not being my business to think anything of the sort. “Well,” she said quietly, “whether it is your business or not, I will tell you that we are not happy.” I said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished. She began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent, and that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She stopped suddenly, and looked up at me. “You don’t know anything about me, do you?” she asked.",0
"“It must have been done since yesterday, otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once but that is not to the point.” “It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps Mrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.” “You brought only one candle into the room?” “Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He seemed to see something over here” I indicated the mantelpiece “that absolutely paralysed him.” “That is interesting,” said Poirot quickly.",0
"What could I do? I knew I wouldn’t be able to stand up against torture very long. “Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my head. The subject had always interested me, and I’d read an awful lot about it. I had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I could succeed in carrying the bluff through, it might save me. I said a prayer, and drew a long breath. Then I opened my eyes and started babbling in French! “Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once.",0
"""By a miracle you escaped Poirot did not!"" A cry burst from my lips. ""Not dead? Not dead?"" Ridgeway bowed his head, his features working with emotion. With desperate energy I pulled myself to a sitting position. ""Poirot may be dead,"" I said weakly. ""But his spirit lives on. I will carry on his work! Death to the Big Four!"" Then I fell back, fainting. Even now I can hardly bear to write of those days in March.",0
"“Still, you know, he is superstitious, the old man. Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these fortune-telling people. She prophesied a lifetime of success, but declared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.” He had interested her now. She looked up eagerly. “That is strange, very strange! Through a woman, you say?” He smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “Doubtless, now that he has retired, he will marry. Some young society beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he acquired them.” Nadina shook her head. “No, no, that is not the way of it.",0
"“Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the smaller desk in the corner?” “Mr. Inglethorp’s.” “Ah!” He tried the roll top tentatively. “Locked. But perhaps one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s keys would open it.” He tried several, twisting and turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction. “Voilà! It is not the key, but it will open it at a pinch.” He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking approvingly as he relocked the desk: “Decidedly, he is a man of method, this Mr.",0
"I was awfully surprised to find that she really was fond of me I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. When we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully, when I had finished. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you. Oh, Anne, dear, don’t be cross, but how do you know that this young man of yours is telling the truth? You believe every word he says.” “Of course I do,” I cried indignantly.",0
"“And now, Miss Tuppence,” said Sir James, “we want to hear your adventures.” “That’s so,” agreed Julius. Tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius occasionally interjected an admiring “Bully.” Sir James said nothing until she had finished, when his quiet “well done, Miss Tuppence,” made her flush with pleasure. “There’s one thing I don’t get clearly,” said Julius. “What put her up to clearing out?” “I don’t know,” confessed Tuppence. Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully. “The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was unpremeditated.",0
"Renauld come in? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very wonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations, or otherwise, could affect her?” “Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that you’re wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her.",0
"I’m going right back to London to put the case in the hands of your British police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths. Sleuths! It was a piece of damn-fool foolishness! I’m through! I’ve had enough of it. Scotland Yard for me!” “You’re right,” said Tommy slowly. “I wish to God we’d gone there right away.” “Better late than never. We’ve been like a couple of babes playing ‘Here we go round the Mulberry Bush.’ Now I’m going right along to Scotland Yard to ask them to take me by the hand and show me the way I should go. I guess the professional always scores over the amateur in the end.",0
"On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck. I think it was a “witch”!  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Mount Nelson Hotel,  Cape Town. It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden.",0
"“Won’t you just stay and have something to eat?” We accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs. We had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the door, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The parlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart. “It was a man standing in the passage.” Poirot rushed out, returning quickly. “There is no one there.” “Isn’t there, sir?” said the parlourmaid weakly. “Oh, it did give me a start!” “But why?” She dropped her voice to a whisper.",0
"I feel he’s here!” She looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely: “With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well for that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to be in the flat without our knowledge.” The girl was a little comforted by his words. “Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,” she confessed. “Yes,” said Sir James. “We are in the condition of people holding a séance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous results.” “Do you believe in spiritualism?” asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide.",0
"I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air. “Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “Parbleu! to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me.",0
"Did he know that we suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the fact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear, or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked man. But did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In her soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her slender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability.",0
"“To-morrow you’ll have some questions to answer, and after you’ve answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we’ve more ways than one of making obstinate little fools talk.” It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until to-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.",0
"My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know.",0
"To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder me and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend. Sir Eustace’s attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are not in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had a genuinely kindly feeling towards me. Then why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says “because he’s a damned scoundrel,” and seems to think that settles the matter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her, and she put it down to a “fear complex.” Suzanne goes in rather for psycho-analysis.",0
"There's no mark of one in particular to be seen."" ""Not with the eyes of the body, perhaps; but with the eyes of the mind, yes."" The Inspector touched his forehead significantly with a grin at me. I was utterly bewildered, but I had faith in Poirot. Further discussion ended in our all driving back to Moreton with the Inspector. Poirot and I were taken to Grant, but a constable was to be present during the interview. Poirot went straight to the point. ""Grant, I know you to be innocent of this crime.",0
"When he had finished, she drew a long breath. “But you are wonderful magnificent! You are the greatest detective in the world.” With a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French. “Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so. Oh, save him, save him save him!” We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us.",0
"She explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a “secret” of far reaching European importance. They had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but Madame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members of the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. On the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to clean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open.",0
"She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine for all the world as though she’d been running a race and yet Pagett told me that he’d seen her off to Durban last night! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body. And she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, “Secretaries I have had.” No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once. No.",0
"The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson’s feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn’t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: “Don’t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him.",0
"There are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various aliases. The American Secret Service, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye upon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington. They felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question. One of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face of it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.",0
"""And what exactly is your opinion of the affair, Hastings?"" I did not at once reply to his question; I felt the need of going warily. ""It all seems so complicated,"" I said cautiously. ""Does it not?"" said Poirot delightedly. ""I suppose our rushing off like this is a pretty clear sign that you consider Mr. Paynter's death to be murder not suicide or the result of an accident?"" ""No, no; you misunderstand me, Hastings. Granting that Mr. Paynter died as the result of a particularly terrible accident, there are still a number of mysterious circumstances to be explained.",0
"“Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly 10th viscount, served South African War’ tout ça n’a pas d’importance ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ um, um, um, ‘has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. Clubs residences.’ Voilà, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this milord!” “What?” “Yes. I telegraphed to him.” “I thought you had washed your hands of the case?” “I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.",0
"And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. Maman will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “Mon ami,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she is beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned.",0
"Didn’t I tell you that? She just rapped out a ‘no’ without any kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns call it, I’ve heard. But she’ll come round right enough. Likely enough, I hustled her some ” But Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum. “What did she say in that note?” he demanded fiercely. The obliging Julius handed it to him. “There’s no earthly clue in it as to where she’s gone,” he assured Tommy. “But you might as well see for yourself if you don’t believe me.",0
"""Oh, yes, he will. I will arrange for you such testimonials as shall make him lick his lips. The Home Secretary himself shall recommend you."" This seemed to be carrying things a bit far, but Poirot waved aside my remonstrances. ""Oh, yes, he will do it. I investigated for him a little matter which might have caused a grave scandal. All was solved with discretion and delicacy, and now, as you would say, he perches upon my hand like the little bird and pecks the crumbs."" Our first step was to engage the services of an artist in ""make up."" He was a little man, with a quaint bird-like turn of the head, not unlike Poirot's own.",0
"Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War.",0
"""Yes?” “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.” “And the chauffeur?” “The chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.” “So,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the Prime Minister in France, and O’Murphy in London.",0
"He was inclined to resent our appearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland Yard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation. This was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The story he had to tell was a sensational one. On the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his master.",0
"His only regret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its full flavour. “That is true,” said the working man suddenly. “Comrades, we have been betrayed!” An ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly. “That’s better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if you don’t use your brains?” “You will tell us who has betrayed us,” said the German. “But that shall not save you oh, no! You shall tell us all that you know.",0
"It is from the latter class that actor managers usually spring. They seize a part and mould it to their own personality. The former class is quite likely to spend its days doing Mr. Lloyd George at different music halls, or impersonating old men with beards in repertory plays. It is among that former class that we must look for our Number Four. He is a supreme artist in the way he sinks himself in each part he plays."" I was growing interested. ""So you fancy you may be able to trace his identity through his connection with the stage?"" ""Your reasoning is always brilliant, Hastings."" ""It might have been better,"" I said coldly, ""if the idea had come to you sooner.",0
""" The Scotland Yard Inspector was, indeed, waiting on the platform, and greeted us warmly. ""Well, Moosior Poirot, this is good. Thought you'd like to be let in on this. Tip-top mystery, isn't it?"" I read this aright as showing Japp to be completely puzzled and hoping to pick up a pointer from Poirot. Japp had a car waiting, and we drove up in it to Croftlands. It was a square, white house, quite unpretentious, and covered with creepers, including the starry yellow jasmine. Japp looked up at it as we did. ""Must have been balmy to go writing that, poor old cove,"" he remarked.",0
"” I had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed another figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in the rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew who it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic in the peaceful morning sunlight. What must he have thought of me? It made me hot to realize the things that I had said. And I hadn’t meant them or had I? I turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain. If Rayburn had come up here to be alone, I, at least, need not disturb him by advertising my presence.",0
"That woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.” I did not reply. “Instinct is a marvellous thing,” mused Poirot. “It can neither be explained nor ignored.” “You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,” I observed coldly. “Perhaps you don’t realize that I am still in the dark.” “Really? Is that so, mon ami?” “Yes. Enlighten me, will you?” Poirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense surprise, he shook his head decidedly. “No, my friend.” “Oh, look here, why not?” “Two is enough for a secret.” “Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.",0
"Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain. On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?” “Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one of your efforts of fancy.” “It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears.",0
"He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope. On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it. I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this. Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.",0
"""What does he himself say to that?” “Denied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid was positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose. Rather a weak story! And there’s fresh evidence against him come to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well, that ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called Billy Kellett! He’s already known to the police did three months last autumn for lifting an old gentleman’s watch.",0
"Inglethorp and Miss Howard.” She looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner. “Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?” “Well, don’t you?” I said, rather taken aback. “No.” She was smiling in her quiet way. “I should like to see a good flare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so much, and saying so little.” “John doesn’t think so,” I remarked. “He’s anxious to keep them apart.” “Oh, John!” Something in her tone fired me, and I blurted out: “Old John’s an awfully good sort.” She studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my great surprise: “You are loyal to your friend.",0
"“Now, what about Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that evening?” “Well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen is a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been able once or twice to score a coup off Davenheim in the market, though it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter concerning some South American shares which led the banker to make his appointment.” “Had Davenheim interests in South America, then?” “I believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in Buenos Ayres.",0
"Not that I had ever succeeded in being able to distinguish one Chinaman from another. He must have been with Ingles on his way to China, and after the catastrophe he had returned to England with a message, possibly, for me. It was vital, imperative that I should hear that message. ""Is he conscious?"" I asked. ""Can he speak? Mr. Ingles was an old friend of mine, and I think it possible that this poor fellow has brought me a message from him. Mr. Ingles is believed to have gone overboard about ten days ago.",0
"When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.",0
"When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong.",0
"""I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.” He looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up flushed and excited. “God help me, so you are,” he muttered, and went abruptly out. My recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most serious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be actually broken. A careful examination, however, convinced him that it was not so, and although it was very painful I was recovering the use of it quite quickly. It was a strange time.",0
"Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating. “I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took the path to the bridge. I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge.",0
"Certainly he could not sustain the fiction of a match. He tried all he knew to avoid the contest. When that failed, Wilson's doom was sealed. At all costs he must be prevented from discovering that the great Savaronoff did not even know how to play chess. Wilson was fond of the Ruy Lopez opening, and was certain to use it. Number Four arranged for death to come with the third move, before any complications of defence set in.",0
"“But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.” “Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.” Mr. Chichester did not reply. “Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally. “To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.",0
"I still don’t understand why, if he’s Mr. Brown, he rescued us.” “Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?” Tuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the evening, ending up: “But I can’t see why!” “Can’t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a last hope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape and the escape must be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a put-up job. They’re not averse to young Beresford’s being in the neighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They’ll take care to get him out of the way at the right minute.",0
"That is our part to let the other side make the attack."" ""You think they will?"" I said doubtfully. ""I have no doubt whatever of it. To begin with, see, they try to get me out of England. That fails. Then, in the Dartmoor affair, we step in and save their victim from the gallows. And yesterday, once again, we interfere with their plans. Assuredly, they will not leave the matter there."" As I reflected on this, there was a knock on the door. Without waiting for a reply, a man stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. He was a tall, thin man, with a slightly hooked nose and a sallow complexion.",0
"""A man carries his profession written in his face, they say."" ""He's a criminal,"" I cried. ""He is an adept in the art of making up."" ""It's the same thing."" ""Rather a sweeping statement, Hastings, and one which would hardly be appreciated by the theatrical world. Do you not see that the man is, or has been, at one time or another, an actor?"" ""An actor?"" ""But certainly. He has the whole technique at his fingertips. Now there are two classes of actors, the one who sinks himself in his part, and the one who manages to impress his personality upon it.",0
"“My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But, seriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp’s innocence?” “Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.” “But the evidence is so conclusive.” “Yes, too conclusive.” We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now familiar stairs. “Yes, yes, too conclusive,” continued Poirot, almost to himself. “Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be examined sifted.",0
"""I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely it. Too much so perhaps. Was he or was he not just a little like a stage clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly.",0
"I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so.",0
"""Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?” “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow.",0
"I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “Mon ami! Vive l’amour! It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!” After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived.",0
"No guests were staying in the house, and I was busy with Mr. Ryland in his study all the evening. I had foreseen that this would be the case, which was why I had had no hope of being able to meet Poirot at the station. I was, however, confident that I would be dismissed well before eleven o'clock. Sure enough, just after ten-thirty, Mr. Ryland glanced at the clock, and announced that he was ""through."" I took the hint and retired discreetly. I went upstairs as though going to bed, but slipped quietly down a side staircase and let myself out into the garden, having taken the precaution to don a dark overcoat to hide my white shirt-front.",0
"Our clues have all ended in thin air. You can take my word for it that there is nothing more to be done. If anything should arise, I shall be glad to advise you in any way I can.” His words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling. “I suppose you’re right,” she said. “Anyway, thank you very much for trying to help us. Good-bye.” Julius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir James’s keen eyes, as he gazed into the girl’s downcast face. “Don’t be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,” he said in a low voice. “Remember, holiday-time isn’t always all playtime.",0
"""We go, Hastings, to see the one man in England who knows most of the underground life of China."" ""Indeed! Who is he?"" ""A man you have never heard of a Mr. John Ingles. To all intents and purposes, he is a retired Civil Servant of mediocre intellect, with a house full of Chinese curios with which he bores his friends and acquaintances. Nevertheless, I am assured by those who should know that the only man capable of giving me the information I seek is this same John Ingles."" A few moments more saw us ascending the steps of The Laurels, as Mr. Ingles's residence was called.",0
"“Their clothes are different, perhaps, but they themselves are just the same.” “Well, perhaps you’re right. Minxes then minxes now!” “That’s it,” said Tuppence. “I’m a frightful minx myself.” “I believe you,” said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched her ear in high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of the “old bear,” as they termed him. Tuppence’s pertness delighted the old misogynist.",0
"I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere. “Well?” There was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he any idea of what I was about to say? “This is the message.” I dropped my voice still lower. “‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’” “What on earth does he mean?” Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected astonishment. “Don’t you know?” “Not in the least. Do you?” I was compelled to shake my head. “What extra coffee-cup?” “I don’t know.” “He’d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about coffee-cups.",0
"Once set him on my track, and all might yet be well? Dare I risk it? Apparently I was under no supervision, but yet I hesitated. It would have been so easy for the Chinaman to come up and assure himself that I was keeping to the letter of the command. Why didn't he? His very abstention made me more suspicious. I had seen so much of the omnipotence of the Big Four that I credited them with almost super-human powers. For all I know, even the little bedraggled servant girl might be one of their agents. No, I dared not risk it. But one thing I could do, leave the telegram. He would know then that Cinderella had disappeared, and who was responsible for her disappearance.",0
"“Now, Poirot,” I remarked resignedly, “perhaps you will tell me what all this is about?” “Well, mon ami, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you realize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is greatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have cleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs. Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening.",0
"After our recent conversation, he gave ‘Dinner’ to my ‘Tuesday,’ but ‘Journey’ and ‘Country’ were answered by ‘Ship’ and ‘Uganda,’ showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here. ‘Story’ recalls to him one of the ‘Lion’ stories he told at dinner. I proceed to ‘Rook Rifle’ and he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘Farm.’ When I say ‘Shot,’ he answers at once ‘Suicide.’ The association seems clear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere.",0
"” For the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but Tuppence, recovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence culled from detective fiction. “When did you last see the dece your cousin, I mean?” “Never seen her,” responded Mr. Hersheimmer. “What?” demanded Tommy, astonished. Hersheimmer turned to him. “No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were brother and sister, just as you might be” Tommy did not correct this view of their relationship “but they didn’t always get on together.",0
"The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably deeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and here the words that he used are significant.” “‘Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now,’” I repeated. “They seem to me a little vehement, perhaps, that is all.” “That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why? Not only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.” “Why should it be?” I asked, bewildered. “That is what we ask ourselves.",0
"All these reflections passed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where a chance, a very problematical chance, lay, and she determined to risk all in one supreme effort. Accordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees before Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically. “I don’t believe it,” she moaned. “It’s poison I know it’s poison. Oh, don’t make me drink it” her voice rose to a shriek “don’t make me drink it!” Mrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at this sudden collapse. “Get up, you little idiot! Don’t go on drivelling there.",0
"'Number Two is represented by an S with two lines through it the sign for a dollar, also by two stripes and a star. It may be conjectured therefore that he is an American subject, and that he represents the power of wealth.' Add to those words the fact that Ryland offered me a huge sum to tempt me out of England and and what about it, Hastings?"" ""You mean,"" I said, staring, ""that you suspect Abe Ryland, the multi-millionaire, of being Number Two of the Big Four."" ""Your bright intellect has grasped the idea, Hastings. Yes, I do.",0
"“There’s something of the simplicity of the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire ahead. I’m listening.” “To begin with,” said Tuppence, “what have we to go upon?” “Absolutely nothing,” said Tommy cheerily. “Wrong!” Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. “We have two distinct clues.” “What are they?” “First clue, we know one of the gang.” “Whittington?” “Yes. I’d recognize him anywhere.” “Hum,” said Tommy doubtfully, “I don’t call that much of a clue. You don’t know where to look for him, and it’s about a thousand to one against your running against him by accident.",0
"""Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.” He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside. “Eh bien, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?” I did not reply. Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going.",0
"Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.” Black was straightforward enough over the matter. “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what” “What has it got to do with Mr.",0
"But how the dickens did he come or go? They notice strangers quick enough in a little place like this. It came to me all at once nobody did come. I took a good look round. It had rained the night before, and there were footprints clear enough going in and out of the kitchen. In the living-room there were two sets of footprints only (Betsy Andrews' stopped at the door) -Mr. Whalley's (he was wearing carpet slippers) and another man's. The other man had stepped in the blood-stains, and I traced his bloody footprints I beg your pardon, sir."" ""Not at all,"" said Mr. Ingles, with a faint smile; ""the adjective is perfectly understood.",0
"An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend. His eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to the uttermost. “I have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.” Major Norman moved hastily to the door. “I’ll order the car.” “There is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has fallen.” “Do you mean you are going to walk, sir?” “No, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea by boat.” “To cross the sea?” “Yes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And the beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return to England.",0
"“But where did their ‘method’ break down?” “Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark” “I remember,” I cried. “Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!” There was a moment’s silence. “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me. “This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed.",0
"""Why?” “To find a possible witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love.",0
"But, at all events, here you are that is the great thing. And now we lie here perdu till the moment comes for the last grand coup the final overthrowing of the Big Four."" From our quiet retreat in the Ardennes we watched the progress of affairs in the great world. We were plentifully supplied with newspapers, and every day Poirot received a bulky envelope, evidently containing some kind of report. He never showed these reports to me, but I could usually tell from his manner whether its contents had been satisfactory or otherwise.",0
"Poirot smiled kindly on me. “The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, mon ami. You are agitated; you are excited it is but natural. Presently, when we are calmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We will examine and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side; those of no importance, pouf!” he screwed up his cherub-like face, and puffed comically enough “blow them away!” “That’s all very well,” I objected, “but how are you going to decide what is important, and what isn’t? That always seems the difficulty to me.” Poirot shook his head energetically.",0
"“Say you’re sorry about my sister ” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have.",0
"“This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried.",0
"Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.” “Pardon,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?” “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said.",0
"My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation.",0
"""You are sure of that?” “I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?” “Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?” Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated apologetically.",0
"On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer.",0
"“It wasn’t so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the boughs mighty slippery, and it was all I could do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was level with the window. “But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could only see sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of wallpaper was all I could command. Well, that wasn’t any manner of good to me, but just as I was going to give it up, and climb down ignominiously, some one inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of wall and, by gum, it was Whittington! “After that, my blood was up.",0
"There was therefore no means of destroying a thick document such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy some important document possibly a will. So the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell into a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs.",0
"We were cut off from the world, alone together as Adam and Eve might have been but with what a difference! Old Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have done. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much of it as I could manage with one arm. Harry was out a good part of the time, but we spent long hours together lying out in the shade of the palms, talking and quarrelling discussing everything under high heaven, quarrelling and making it up again. We bickered a good deal, but there grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I could never have believed possible. That and something else.",0
"“By the way,” observed Mr. Carter, “have you shown yourself to Miss Tuppence yet? She’s been bombarding me with letters about you.” “Tuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go to the police?” Mr. Carter shook his head. “Then I wonder how they twigged me.” Mr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The other nodded thoughtfully. “True, that’s rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the Ritz was an accidental remark?” “It might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me suddenly in some way.” “Well,” said Mr.",0
"""Are you going to try to cure your 'overweening vanity?' Your 'finicky tidiness?'"" I was quoting, and I could see that he was not pleased with my retort. ""Oh, without doubt, Hastings, in some things they deceive themselves tant mieux! They will learn in due time. Meanwhile we have learnt something, and to know is to be prepared."" This last was a favourite axiom of his lately; so much so that I had begun to hate the sound of it. ""We know something, Hastings,"" he continued. ""Yes, we know something and that is to the good but we do not know nearly enough.",0
"""And then?” “She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper under where she’d signed.” “Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?” asked Poirot sharply. “No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.” “And you signed where she told you?” “Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.” “What did she do with it afterwards?” “Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk.” “What time was it when she first called you?” “About four, I should say, sir.",0
"“What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M.",0
"“Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.",0
"I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms heavily paid for to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt.",0
" Is that your idea, Tuppence?” “It’s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in it.” “How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?” “Advertisement,” replied Tuppence promptly. “Have you got a bit of paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and powder-puffs.” Tommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began writing busily. “Shall we begin: ‘Young officer, twice wounded in the war ’” “Certainly not.” “Oh, very well, my dear boy.",0
"He had read of American murder trials running much on the lines indicated by Julius. He had bought and sold justice himself. This virile young American, with the significant drawling voice, had the whip hand of him. “I’m going to count five,” continued Julius, “and I guess, if you let me get past four, you needn’t worry any about Mr. Brown. Maybe he’ll send some flowers to the funeral, but you won’t smell them! Are you ready? I’ll begin. One two three four ” The Russian interrupted with a shriek: “Do not shoot. I will do all you wish.” Julius lowered the revolver.",0
"Dressed precisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel. “And my boots,” he wailed. “Regard them, Hastings. My boots, of the neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the sand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which outrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to become limp but limp!” “Look at the Sphinx,” I urged. “Even I can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales.” Poirot looked at it discontentedly. “It has not the air happy,” he declared. “How could it, half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion.",0
"It was a slim pocket-book of brown leather, and had evidently fallen from our visitor's pocket during his struggle with me. It contained two receipted bills in the name of M. Felix Laon, and a folded-up piece of paper which made my heart beat faster. It was a half sheet of note-paper on which a few words were scrawled in pencil but they were words of supreme importance. ""The next meeting of the council will be on Friday at 34 Rue des Echelles at 11 a.m."" It was signed with a big figure 4. And to-day was Friday, and the clock on the mantelpiece showed the hour to be 10:30. ""My God, what a chance!"" I cried.",0
"In the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25, 3.27. Supposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29 Doors were banging. Tommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him. Then a hand fell on his shoulder. “Here I am, son. Your British traffic beats description! Put me wise to the crooks right away.” “That’s Whittington there, getting in now, that big dark man. The other is the foreign chap he’s talking to.” “I’m on to them. Which of the two is my bird?” Tommy had thought out this question. “Got any money with you?” Julius shook his head, and Tommy’s face fell. “I guess I haven’t more than three or four hundred dollars with me at the moment,” explained the American.",0
"It was a solemn and moving ceremony, and the extraordinary number of floral tributes passed belief. They came from high and low alike, and bore striking testimony to the place my friend had made for himself in the country of his adoption. For myself, I was frankly overcome by emotion as I stood by the grave side and thought of all our varied experiences and the happy days we had passed together. By the beginning of May I had mapped out a plan of campaign. I felt that I could not do better than keep Poirot's scheme of advertising for any information respecting Claud Darrell.",0
"“It is really insupportable,” he murmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!” “Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars that is, if you know!” “Eh bien, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!” “Do you know where he is hiding?” “Certainly! It is most ingenious.",0
"“And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s have your deductions, Hastings.” “‘Obvious, my dear Watson,’” I quoted lightly. “She went to the wrong flat.” “Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” cried Mrs. Robinson admiringly. I rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities. The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities. “A curious story,” he said thoughtfully.",0
"Poirot was very sorry for the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance Company, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said gently to Mrs. Maltravers: “Madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!” “What do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide. “Have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? You are mediumistic, you know.” “I have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism, surely?” “Madame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say in the village that this house is haunted?” She nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready.",0
"On turning it over, words were found to be scrawled across it, feebly traced in ink. A writing-table stood close to the chair in which Mr. Paynter had been sitting, and the forefinger of the victim's right hand was ink-stained up to the second joint. It was clear that, too weak to hold a pen, Mr. Paynter had dipped his finger in the ink-pot and managed to scrawl these two words across the surface of the newspaper he held but the words themselves seemed utterly fantastic: Yellow Jasmine just that and nothing more.",0
"If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully. Two bells went overhead. One o’clock! And nothing. Wait what was that? I heard the quick light patter of feet running running along the passage. Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell inside. “Save me,” he said hoarsely. “They’re after me.” It was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear footsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act.",0
"Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast. “And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,” she added severely. Tommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly ugly nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether. They were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there.",0
"""It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves or some one walking over my grave. I keep feeling something dreadful’s going to happen.” “Don’t be silly,” said Suzanne, with decision. “Let’s talk of something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.",0
"“Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were being hustled into those boats. I can see it all now.” She closed her eyes with a shudder. Julius looked across at Sir James, who nodded. “Don’t worry any. It isn’t worth it. Now, see here, Jane, there’s something we want to know about. There was a man aboard that boat with some mighty important papers on him, and the big guns in this country have got a notion that he passed on the goods to you. Is that so?” The girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius understood. “Mr.",0
"""I suppose the Big Four couldn't have had some diabolical contrivance concealed in the ceiling something which descended automatically and cut the old man's throat and was afterwards drawn up again?"" ""Like Jacob's ladder? I know, Hastings, that you have an imagination of the most fertile but I implore of you to keep it within bounds."" I subsided, abashed. Poirot continued to wander about, poking into rooms and cupboards with a profoundly dissatisfied expression on his face. Suddenly he uttered an excited yelp, reminiscent of a Pomeranian dog. I rushed to join him. He was standing in the larder in a dramatic attitude.",0
"She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room God! It was horrible. Dead and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in.",0
"Of the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself passionately on her husband’s side, scorning the mere idea of his guilt, and fought for him tooth and nail. I expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully. “Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her jealousy have ” “Jealousy?” I queried. “Yes.",0
"Personally I could not see that it was of any value whatever, especially as whoever compiled the notes was ludicrously mistaken in some of his opinions. I pointed this out to my friend when we were back in our rooms. ""My dear Poirot,"" I said, ""you know now what the enemy thinks of us. He appears to have a grossly exaggerated idea of your brain power, and to have absurdly underrated mine, but I do not see how we are better off for knowing this."" Poirot chuckled in rather an offensive way.",0
"“To think that Julius must have been actually under the same roof with her for a few hours.” “I was a darned idiot,” muttered Julius gloomily. “You couldn’t know,” Tuppence consoled him. “Could he?” She appealed to Sir James. “I should advise you not to worry,” said the latter kindly. “No use crying over spilt milk, you know.” “The great thing is what to do next,” added Tuppence the practical. Sir James shrugged his shoulders. “You might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl. That is the only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not hope for much result. Otherwise there is nothing to be done.” “Nothing?” said Tuppence blankly.",0
"“Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course.",0
"“It seems strange to you, mon ami, that a man should plan his own death? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you he did not intend to die.” I shook my head, bewildered. “But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told you, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a different angle. “Georges Conneau flies from justice to Canada.",0
"“Yes, it’s a fine property. It’ll be mine some day should be mine now by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I shouldn’t be so damned hard up as I am now.” “Hard up, are you?” “My dear Hastings, I don’t mind telling you that I’m at my wits’ end for money.” “Couldn’t your brother help you?” “Lawrence? He’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings. No, we’re an impecunious lot. My mother’s always been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since her marriage, of course ” he broke off, frowning.",0
"Poirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and, carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned me to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and set out for Styles. I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a shock especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had realized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could have done.",0
"What then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment? “One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs. Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she asked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband’s desk locked. She was anxious to find some stamps, and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That one of them fitted I know.",0
"""You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make.",0
"We must investigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.” In about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn. Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged. “I have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us here,” he explained. “You can understand, monsieur le capitaine, that I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers’ state of mind immediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not wish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.",0
"” I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home orphans without consulting me first. “We will send her a wire from the station,” continued the lawyer. My few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat sadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a “Mary” hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out but doesn’t! A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim.",0
"He was known to have refused office in the interests of his profession, preferring to remain a simple Member for a Scotch constituency. Tuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had impressed her. She understood Boris’s agitation. Peel Edgerton would not be an easy man to deceive. In about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence repaired to the hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a piercing glance before. Now, as she handed him his hat and stick, she was conscious of his eyes raking her through.",0
"""You will write M. Hercule Poirot a letter, such a letter as will induce him to hasten hither and join you."" ""I shall do no such thing,"" I said angrily. ""The consequences of refusal will be disagreeable."" ""Damn your consequences."" ""The alternative might be death!"" A nasty shiver ran down my spine, but I endeavoured to put a bold face upon it. ""It's no good threatening me, and bullying me. Keep your threats for Chinese cowards."" ""My threats are very real ones, Captain Hastings.",0
"“Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.” After bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me. “Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?” “Well, I suppose Ascanio is right somebody impersonated him.” “Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn.",0
"You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife wicked little thing! that Jack had given Bella! Ten to one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress.",0
"They’d got the oilskin packet with the blanks, and they were just mad! They didn’t know whether I‘d changed the papers, or whether Danvers had been carrying a dummy message, while the real one was sent another way. They spoke of” she closed her eyes “torturing me to find out! “I’d never known what fear really sickening fear was before! Once they came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be still unconscious, but I was afraid they’d hear the beating of my heart. However, they went away again. I began thinking madly.",0
"It had been got away from me once, and I determined I wouldn’t let on I’d got it until a photographer had made a dozen copies of it!” “We all kept back something or other,” said Tuppence thoughtfully. “I suppose secret service work makes you like that!” In the pause that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small shabby brown book. “Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in the act. That is so. Indeed, not until I read the entries in this little book could I bring myself fully to credit the amazing truth.",0
"His first action was to write to his only relative, a nephew, Gerald Paynter, the son of his younger brother, and to suggest to him that he should come and make his home at Croftlands (as the place is called) with his uncle. Gerald Paynter, who is an impecunious young artist, was glad enough to fall in with the arrangement, and had been living with his uncle for about seven months when the tragedy occurred."" ""Your narrative style is masterly,"" murmured Poirot. ""I say to myself, it is a book that talks, not my friend Hastings."" Paying no attention to Poirot, I went on, warming to the story. ""Mr.",0
"I’d just got to get a look into that room. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that there was a long branch running out from the tree in the right direction. If I could only swarm about half-way along it, the proposition would be solved. But it was mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight. I decided I’d just got to risk that, and I started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I crawled along. The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it didn’t do to think of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where I wanted to be.",0
"Hautet doubtfully. “But it is possibly a little unfair on his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If she were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.” “It may be as you say. Now, M.",0
"Finally we were politely bowed out. “I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street. “You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.” “It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, mon ami. I do not expect to find in a Bank manager a ‘keen financier with an eagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am disappointed in the case it is too easy!” “Easy?” “Yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?” “You know who stole the bonds?” “I do.” “But then we must why” “Do not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going to do anything at present.",0
"The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death ” Poirot interrupted with a quick question.",0
"I’ve been offered a job in the Argentine, and might as well take it. “Yours, “TOMMY BERESFORD.” A peculiar smile lingered for a moment on Julius’s face. He threw the letter into the waste-paper basket. “The darned fool!” he murmured. AFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy’s next procedure was to make a call at South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his professional duties, and introduced himself without more ado as a friend of Tuppence’s. Albert unbent immediately. “Things has been very quiet here lately,” he said wistfully.",0
"“Well,” said Tuppence impatiently. There was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his head and shut to the door. “Nothing,” he said. In five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned. He was deferential to Sir James, whom he recognized. “Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some sleeping-draught.” He sniffed. “Rather an odour of chloral in the air.” Tuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove her to the washstand. She found the little bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer had poured a few drops. It had been three parts full.",0
"""This is where you lick your lips, I perceive."" ""There was a certain amount of feeling evidenced against Dr. Quentin. To begin with, he was not the regular doctor, only a locum, putting in a month's work, whilst Dr. Bolitho was away on a well-earned holiday. Then it was felt that his carelessness was the direct cause of the accident. But his evidence was little short of sensational. Mr. Paynter had been ailing in health ever since his arrival at Croftlands. Dr. Bolitho had attended him for some time, but when Dr.",0
"Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up. Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points.",0
"""Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then in the hotel at Kimberley we met her” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task.",0
"In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.” “You permit, madame?” said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow. “I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time being,” said the inspector. “We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible.” Mr. Opalsen frowned. “Is that necessary?” “I’m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.” “Oh, let him take it, Ed!” cried his wife.",0
"’ I purposely didn’t mention any name because, of course, Whittington might be calling himself something quite different down here, but the doctor answered at once. ‘Mr. Whittington, perhaps?’ ‘That’s the fellow,’ I replied. ‘What’s he doing down here? Don’t tell me his nerves are out of order?’ “Dr. Hall laughed. ‘No. He came down to see one of my nurses, Nurse Edith, who is a niece of his.’ ‘Why, fancy that!’ I exclaimed. ‘Is he still here?’ ‘No, he went back to town almost immediately.’ ‘What a pity!’ I ejaculated.",0
"“Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right.",0
"He was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and cunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze. “Well, what is it?” she asked. The man smiled. “I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young gentleman in Lyons’.” “Well what of it?” “Nothing except that I think I may be of some use to you.” Another inference forced itself into Tuppence’s mind: “You followed me here?” “I took that liberty.",0
"Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports.",0
"""Pas du tout,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that you, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.” “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung. “Si, si, mon ami, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.",0
"Do you remember what Flossie Monro told us before she died? That Claud Darrell had a habit of dabbing his bread on the table to pick up crumbs. Hastings, this is a vast plot, and that vacant-looking young man is our arch enemy Number Four! Hurry."" I did not wait to argue. Incredible as the whole thing seemed, it was wiser not to delay. We scrambled down the ivy as quietly as we could and made a bee-line for the small town and the railway station. We were just able to catch the last train, the 8.34 which would land us in town about eleven o'clock.",0
"Halliday's experiments and views were exceedingly interesting to me."" Poirot nodded. Then he asked a question which surprised me. ""Madame, where did you converse on these topics. In here?"" ""No, monsieur. In the laboratory."" ""May I see it?"" ""Certainly."" She led the way to the door from which she had entered. It opened on a small passage. We passed through two doors and found ourselves in the big laboratory, with its array of beakers and crucibles and a hundred appliances of which I did not even know the names. There were two occupants, both busy with some experiment. Madame Olivier introduced them. ""Mademoiselle Claude, one of my assistants."" A tall, serious-faced young girl bowed to us.",0
"In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order.",0
"“(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that she might have killed M. Renauld.",0
"And the idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look at each other one of us is Mr. Brown which? He commands but also he serves. Among us in the midst of us. And no one knows which he is” With an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy. He looked at his watch. “Yes,” said Whittington. “We might as well go.” He called the waitress and asked for his bill. Tommy did likewise, and a few moments later was following the two men down the stairs. Outside, Whittington hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to go to Waterloo.",0
"No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He’s not to leave the house without orders.” He put the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping the table with his hand. “May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,” I said, after a minute or two of silence. “Certainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.",0
"Vandemeyer? You did, didn’t you?” “My dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that there were equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.” “Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn’t it?” “Well, perhaps it was,” admitted Sir James gravely. “Well, I want to know more. I want to know just why you gave me a hint.” Sir James smiled at her earnestness. “Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of character?” “Of course,” said Tuppence. “I know lawyers are always dreadfully careful. But can’t we say ‘without prejudice’ first, and then say just what we want to.",0
"She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her.",0
"We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there.",0
"I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or less.” “There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate say a case of burglary can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.",0
"I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can.",0
"“Well?” I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on all the vital facts. Poirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “Mon pauvre ami! But it is that you have not the gift! The important detail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.” “How?” “Let me take your four points. “One: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could not know beforehand that Mr.",0
"He knew it. He is a sensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she did not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are both unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He drifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately cultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of John Cavendish’s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big decision?” “Yes, I quite understood your distress.” “Pardon me, mon ami, but you did not understand it in the least.",0
"” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered. Arrived at the Villa Geneviève, Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open.",0
"” Mr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair. “Put me wise,” he said succinctly. Tommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded version of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility of her having been mixed up unawares in “some political show.” He alluded to Tuppence and himself as “private inquiry agents” commissioned to find her, and added that they would therefore be glad of any details Mr. Hersheimmer could give them. That gentleman nodded approval. “I guess that’s all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London gets my goat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out your questions and I’ll answer.",0
"As we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some stamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office. As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just entering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud exclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly. “Mon ami Hastings!” he cried. “It is indeed mon ami Hastings!” “Poirot!” I exclaimed. I turned to the pony-trap. “This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old friend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.” “Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,” said Cynthia gaily.",0
"But if they know that the papers have been recovered by us, neither of those two girls’ lives will be worth an hour’s purchase. I must try and get hold of Tuppence before Jane escapes. “I want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to Tuppence at the Ritz. Sir James Peel Edgerton said you would be able to manage that for me. He’s frightfully clever. “One last thing please have that house in Soho watched day and night. “Yours, etc., “THOMAS BERESFORD.” The Prime Minister looked up. “The enclosure?” Mr. Carter smiled dryly. “In the vaults of the Bank. I am taking no chances.",0
"“We haven’t exactly proved it yet. But we’re after her. And” she produced a long-drawn-out wink “I guess she won’t get away with the goods this time.” Albert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight. “Mind you, sonny, not a word of this,” said Tuppence suddenly. “I guess I oughtn’t to have put you wise, but in the States we know a real smart lad when we see one.” “I’ll not breathe a word,” protested Albert eagerly.",0
"With your permission, mon ami, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.",0
"""What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see.",0
"Where do you think she can be, Sir James?” The lawyer shook his head. “Impossible to say. But I’ve a very good idea where she has been.” “You have? Where?” Sir James smiled. “At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing home.” “There? Impossible. I asked.” “No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly be under an assumed name.” “Bully for you,” cried Julius. “I never thought of that!” “It was fairly obvious,” said the other. “Perhaps the doctor’s in it too,” suggested Tuppence. Julius shook his head.",0
"At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it.",0
"My door happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking to some one in the passage. She was one of them! They still fancied it might be a bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make sure! After that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody. “I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost forgot that I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the part of Janet Vandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks. I became really ill for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I felt sure I should die soon, and that nothing really mattered.",0
"And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.",0
"Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself.",0
"What I want you to do now is to describe to me the game of chess the other evening."" ""How do you mean describe it?"" ""Well, I do not play the chess myself, but I understand that there are various regular ways of beginning the gambit, do they not call it?"" Dr. Savaronoff smiled a little. ""Ah! I comprehend you now. Wilson opened Ruy Lopez one of the soundest openings there is, and one frequently adopted in tournaments and matches.",0
"Good luck to you. The game is in your hands now.” He shook hands with them both. Ten minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class carriage en route for Chester. For a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius broke the silence, it was with a totally unexpected remark. “Say,” he observed thoughtfully, “did you ever make a darned fool of yourself over a girl’s face?” Tommy, after a moment’s astonishment, searched his mind. “Can’t say I have,” he replied at last. “Not that I can recollect, anyhow.",0
"He spoke a good bit lower than she did but she answered: ‘How dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe everything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace upon our name!’ Again I didn’t hear what he said, but she went on: ‘Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty clearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ Then I thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.” “You are sure it was Mr.",0
"“I have been admiring these flower beds. How many gardeners are employed here, by the way?” “Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as a gentleman’s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir. A fair sight it was. But now there’s only old Manning, and young William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like. Ah, these are dreadful times!” “The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now, will you send Annie to me here?” “Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.” “How did you know that Mrs.",0
"“You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile.",0
"And don’t you forget I’ve got you covered every inch of the way. I can shoot just as well through my coat pocket. One word, or a glance even, at one of those liveried menials, and there’ll sure be a strange face in the Sulphur and Brimstone Works!” Together they descended the stairs, and passed out to the waiting car. The Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel servants surrounded them. A cry hovered on his lips, but at the last minute his nerve failed him. The American was a man of his word. When they reached the car, Julius breathed a sigh of relief. The danger-zone was passed.",0
"“What has South Africa to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms, her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and her diamonds” I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of the miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist.",0
"On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven. “I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr. Vavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.",0
"Think what he stands to lose. I admire the man myself.” But I could not look at it in Poirot’s philosophical way. “And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about all over the country!” I cried indignantly. “Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked Poirot. “So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any other vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.” “Then you think he never really cared for her?” I asked eagerly rather too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.",0
"Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly but don’t hit anybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight to the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have entrusted to her cousin’s keeping. Or, if he conducted the search, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already rifled. He would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation, but the result would have been the same. And I rather fancy some accident would have happened to both of you.",0
"You know Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a house there!” But with an incoherent muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled. That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett.",0
"Engine going round a curve.’” “You could write that under any snapshot of a train,” I said. Women never think of these simple things. “I’m glad we’ve come up here in daylight,” cried Anne Beddingfeld. “I shouldn’t have seen this if I’d gone last night to Durban, should I?” “No,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “You’d have waked up to-morrow morning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of stones and rocks.” “I’m glad I changed my mind,” said Anne, sighing contentedly, and looking round. It was rather a wonderful sight.",0
"” What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance. “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?” Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast. “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I’m with you there, sir.",0
"“You’re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.” “Rot!” said Tommy hastily. “Well, that’s my position. I’m just about desperate.” “So am I! I’ve hung out as long as I could. I’ve touted round. I’ve answered advertisements. I’ve tried every mortal blessed thing. I’ve screwed and saved and pinched! But it’s no good. I shall have to go home!” “Don’t you want to?” “Of course I don’t want to! What’s the good of being sentimental? Father’s a dear I’m awfully fond of him but you’ve no idea how I worry him! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and smoking are immoral.",0
"Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on.",0
"“But but I thought you thought so too?” Poirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea. “Do you mean to say,” I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea, “that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?” Poirot nodded. “Have you never suspected it?” “It never entered my head.",0
"Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West? It worried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He wasn’t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they’d left a daughter Jane who’d been torpedoed in the Lusitania on her way to Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn’t seem able to hear of her over this side. I guessed they weren’t hustling any, so I thought I’d come along over, and speed things up.",0
"The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again: “And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .” “Poirot,” I cried, “I see” “You see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments.",0
"Then I saw.… “You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening?” “But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the 11:40.” My brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant anxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime.",0
"Tommy stroked his own head tenderly, and gave himself up to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a bright idea flashed across his brain. Why not convert imagination into reality? Conrad was undoubtedly the tenant of the house. The others, with the possible exception of the bearded German, merely used it as a rendezvous. Therefore, why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door, and when he entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly on to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard.",0
"""Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?” “Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.” “Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I ” I hesitated. “I want to meet your sister.” We both laughed. “That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy we’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey, especially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed first thing is quite true. I’m not your kind. And that brings trouble I know that well enough.…” Her face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out of it.",0
"“The Chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “The Chinaman the side door.” Lord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart beating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry. There, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace, evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I swooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord Yardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.",0
"The Chinaman's eyelids flickered rapidly, as though in assent, and he added another Italian word, the word ""carrozza."" Two or three more words of murmured Italian came to my ears, and then he fell back abruptly. The doctor pushed me aside. It was all over. The man was dead. I went out into the air again thoroughly bewildered. ""Handel's Largo,"" and a ""carrozza."" If I remembered rightly, a carrozza was a carriage. What possible meaning could lie behind those simple words. The man was a Chinaman, not an Italian, why should he speak in Italian? Surely, if he were indeed Ingles's servant, he must know English? The whole thing was profoundly mystifying. I puzzled over it all the way home.",0
"Beginning with his unsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his return to London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of Tuppence, the call upon Sir James, and the sensational occurrences of the previous night. “But who killed her?” asked Tommy. “I don’t quite understand.” “The doctor kidded himself she took it herself,” replied Julius dryly. “And Sir James? What did he think?” “Being a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster,” replied Julius. “I should say he ‘reserved judgment.",0
"Where we have come across his tracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes the chief rôle. But afterwards we always find that there has been some nonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the background unnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped us once more.” “Oh!” Tuppence jumped. “I wonder ” “Yes?” “I remember in Mr. Whittington’s office. The clerk he called him Brown. You don’t think ” Carter nodded thoughtfully. “Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually mentioned. An idiosyncrasy of genius.",0
"With a sigh she sat up, her eyes still wild and frightened. “It’s all right. Don’t be afraid, my child. You’re quite safe.” Her breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to her cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically. “So you’re not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy of yours was!” “The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,” boasted Tuppence. “So it seems,” said Sir James dryly. “Am I right in thinking that the joint venture has ended in success, and that this” he turned to the girl on the couch “is Miss Jane Finn?” Jane sat up.",0
"“Nonsense!” snapped Tuppence. “Do I look the sort of girl that’s always falling in love with every man she meets?” “You do not. You look the sort of girl that’s mighty often getting fallen in love with!” “Oh!” said Tuppence, rather taken aback. “That’s a compliment, I suppose?” “Sure. Now let’s get down to this. Supposing we never find Beresford and and ” “All right say it! I can face facts. Supposing he’s dead! Well?” “And all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?” “I don’t know,” said Tuppence forlornly. “You’ll be darned lonesome, you poor kid.",0
"They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.” “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.” “You mean they were false?” “Yes, madame. But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart.",0
"” Tuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words on her lips. For a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had been a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly credit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a moment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert.",0
"But there was something about that photo” Julius shook his head, and heaved a sigh “I guess romance is a mighty queer thing!” “It must be,” said Tommy coldly, “if you can come over here in love with one girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.” Julius had the grace to look discomposed. “Well, you see, I’d got a sort of tired feeling that I’d never find Jane and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And then oh, well, the French, for instance, are much more sensible in the way they look at things. They keep romance and marriage apart ” Tommy flushed.",0
"It was no part of the programme to have attention called to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert was purple with suppressed excitement. “I say, miss, she’s a-going!” “Who’s going?” demanded Tuppence sharply. “The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She’s a-packing up, and she’s just sent down word for me to get her a taxi.” “What?” Tuppence clutched his arm. “It’s the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn’t know about it.” “Albert,” cried Tuppence, “you’re a brick. If it hadn’t been for you we’d have lost her.” Albert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.",0
"When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after me! I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since. He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.",0
"Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes.",0
"We have wasted a lot of time."" ""You are in error, mon ami. No more time has been wasted than was unavoidable. For some months now my agents have been engaged on the task. Joseph Aarons is one of them. You remember him? They have compiled a list for me of men fulfilling the necessary qualifications young men round about the age of thirty, of more or less nondescript appearance, and with a gift for playing character parts men, moreover, who have definitely left the stage within the last three years."" ""Well?"" I said, deeply interested. ""The list was, necessarily, rather a long one. For some time now, we have been engaged on the task of elimination.",0
"In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots in the other, none! You see? Some one had passed that way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.” “Where did they get a rake?” “Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot impatiently. “There is no difficulty about that.” “What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, mon ami.",0
"The wind was getting up, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp. “Ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried Poirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then turned the key in the lock. “I shall lock it, so!” “Don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now” And even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door slowly swung open.",0
"The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all.",0
"“There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace made his money!” “Suspecting him again?” “Suzanne, I’ve got into that state that I can’t help suspecting somebody! I don’t really suspect him but, after all, he is Pagett’s employer, and he did own the Mill House.",0
"And, once’s he caught, you’ll be out of danger.” A terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer’s face. “Shall I? Shall I ever be?” She clutched Tuppence’s arm. “You’re sure about the money?” “Quite sure.” “When shall I have it? There must be no delay.” “This friend of mine will be here presently. He may have to send cables, or something like that. But there won’t be any delay he’s a terrific hustler.” A resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer’s face. “I’ll do it.",0
"There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.” “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?” “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.” “And the real Prime Minister?” “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs.",0
"In no way that I could see did he resemble young Templeton, or James the footman, or any other of the various personalities we had come across. Nevertheless, I was convinced that I had to do with no less than the redoubtable Number Four himself. In his voice there was certainly a faint resemblance to the buttoned-up-stranger who had called upon us in Paris. I looked round, undecided as to my course of action. Reading my thoughts, he smiled and gently shook his head. ""I should not advise it,"" he remarked. ""Remember what came of your hasty action in Paris. Let me assure you that my way of retreat is well assured.",0
"His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.",0
"""You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired.",0
"Pagett from their position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind. I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary.",0
"Suddenly, with an incoherent word of excuse, she hurried from the room. We were not long left alone. A squarely-built man with a small red moustache and pince-nez came in. ""Dr. Treves,"" he introduced himself. ""Mrs. Templeton asked me to make her excuses to you. She's in a very bad state, you know. Nervous strain. Worry over her husband and all that. I've prescribed bed and bromide. But she hopes you'll stay and take pot luck, and I'm to do host. We've heard of you down here, M. Poirot, and we mean to make the most of you.",0
"Raikes and that in fact it was John Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.” “But why?” “Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue with Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I discovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who was attracted by the farmer’s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a different interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him.",0
"Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious “Colonel.” Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was steaming out to sea.",0
"Then dreams again long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him warn him what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger some great danger and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. By some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and aching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with rough wooden walls.",0
"Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!” (Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!) “Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?” “Yes, their name is Baker.” The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us.",0
"“But look here, how could he have got at the cocoa? That wasn’t downstairs?” “No, it wasn’t,” I admitted reluctantly. And then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at him. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief, for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that Dr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice. Yet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary Cavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to poison.",0
"Then again, he must be a fairly young man, certainly not over thirty-five. You see, we are getting somewhere. A man between thirty and thirty-five, of medium height and colouring, an adept in the art of make up, and with very few or any teeth of his own."" ""What?"" ""Surely, Hastings. As the keeper, his teeth were broken and discoloured, in Paris they were even and white, as the doctor they protruded slightly, and as Savaronoff they had unusually long canines. Nothing alters the face so completely as a different set of teeth. You see where all this is leading us?"" ""Not exactly,"" I said cautiously.",0
"""It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock of the despatch-case?” “Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely nothing to connect him with the crime.” “There’s only one thing I can’t make out, why didn’t he destroy it at once when he got hold of it?” “Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all that of keeping it on his own person.” “I don’t understand.” “Look at it from his point of view.",0
"Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so.",0
"""But, guv'nor "" ""You did go into the room you did know your master was dead; and you were just preparing to make a bolt of it when the good Betsy made her terrible discovery."" The man stared at Poirot with a dropped jaw. ""Come now, is it not so? I tell you solemnly on my word of honour that to be frank now is your only chance."" ""I'll risk it,"" said the man suddenly. ""It was just as you say. I came in, and went straight to the master and there he was, dead on the floor and blood all round. Then I got the wind up proper. They'd ferret out my record, and for a certainty they'd say it was me as had done him in.",0
"But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. Sacré! if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.",0
"She remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was shadowing when she had last seen him. Already, although she would hardly admit it, she was becoming uneasy about her partner. Where was he? Why had no word of any kind come from him? She had arranged before leaving the Ritz to have all letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small stationer’s shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently. True, it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and she told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd. Still, it was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.",0
"Inglethorp’s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It was still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in the nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had happened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my little case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up, had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In exactly the same way, Mrs.",0
"” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture and in connection with some case. I rather fancy ” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!” We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation.",0
"Miss Howard’s evidence, unimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot’s sagacity except on the occasions when he was what I described to myself as “foolishly pig-headed.” “Do you really think so?” I asked. “Miss Howard had always seemed to me so essentially honest almost uncomfortably so.” Poirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He seemed to speak, and then checked himself.",0
"She gets the voice right every time, and that’s really the principal thing.” Tommy did not hear Boris’s reply, but in response to it Whittington said something that sounded like: “Of course only in an emergency” Then he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became distinct again whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices, or because Tommy’s ears were getting more attuned, he could not tell. But two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener. They were uttered by Boris and they were: “Mr. Brown.",0
"You remember the De Beer diamonds?” “Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I had nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case was hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.” “A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked it under the ‘Colonel’s’ orders, of course. And it was then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time.",0
"What had happened to his usually keen wits? “They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.” “Tiens!” cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration. “But your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.” I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.",0
"The case which he had built up against Grant the man's record, the jade which he had stolen, the boots which fitted the footprints so exactly was to his matter-of-fact mind too complete to be easily upset; but Poirot, compelled much against his inclination to give evidence, convinced the jury. Two witnesses were produced who had seen a butcher's cart drive up to the bungalow on that Monday morning, and the local butcher testified that his cart only called there on Wednesdays and Fridays. A woman was actually found who, when questioned, remembered seeing the butcher's man leaving the bungalow, but she could furnish no useful description of him.",0
"I had done all I could pray Heaven Poirot would read the sign aright. I hurried down again. The Chinaman took the telegram from me, read it, then placed it in his pocket and with a nod beckoned me to follow him. It was a long weary march that he led me. Once we took a bus and once we went for some considerable way in a train, and always our route led us steadily eastward. We went through strange districts, the existence of which I had never dreamed of. We were down by the docks now, I knew, and I realised that I was being taken into the heart of Chinatown. In spite of myself I shivered.",0
"But don’t you worry there’ll be time enough for that later. And it mayn’t be so at all! Do what I tell you lie back and don’t think of anything.” “I’ll try.” The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes. Tuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright much in the attitude of a watchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was nervous. Her eyes flashed continually from one window to the other. She noted the exact position of the communication cord. What it was that she feared, she would have been hard put to it to say. But in her own mind she was far from feeling the confidence displayed in her words.",0
"Poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words: “Key of Roll Top Desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys. “An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is also a young lady of method and order.” Baker came in answer to the bell. “Will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?” Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs.",0
"""You will sell me the Elixir of Life, perhaps? Come, I will make a bargain with you. Once, I had a child. Find my child for me and you shall go free."" ""Madame, I agree. It is a bargain. Your child shall be restored to you. On the faith of on the faith of Hercule Poirot himself."" Again that strange woman laughed this time long and unrestrainedly. ""My dear M. Poirot, I am afraid I laid a little trap for you.",0
"To make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain initial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all that is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his eyes those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now, what is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from himself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand. Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt.",0
"I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again.",0
"I put him to bed in a top room of my own house, intending to question him the next day and that, of course, was stupid of me."" ""How did they get him?"" demanded Poirot. ""That I shall never know. I woke that night to find my house in flames, and was lucky to escape with my life. Investigation showed that a fire of amazing intensity had broken out on the top floor, and the remains of my young chemist friend were charred to a cinder."" I could see from the earnestness with which he had been speaking that Mr.",0
"I believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!” “Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!” “Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.” The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly. “Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,” explained the latter. “Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion.",0
"Plenty of room for a man to hide in that Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and looked inside. No one of course! She stooped down and looked under the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place. Tuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir James were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her. “Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.",0
"But I’ve loved you from the very moment I set eyes on your photo and now I’ve seen you I’m simply crazy about you! If you’ll only marry me, I won’t worry you any you shall take your own time. Maybe you’ll never come to love me, and if that’s the case I’ll manage to set you free. But I want the right to look after you, and take care of you.” “That’s what I want,” said the girl wistfully. “Some one who’ll be good to me. Oh, you don’t know how lonesome I feel!” “Sure thing I do. Then I guess that’s all fixed up, and I’ll see the archbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.",0
"” Then, frowning, he gazed down at the body. “Should you say that was a Spanish type at all?” he asked suddenly. I considered the face carefully. “No,” I said at last. “I should put him down as a Frenchman most decidedly.” Giraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction. “Same here.” He stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of the floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by inch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks.",0
"A pang smote me as it was tossed down on the table. We were defeated hopelessly defeated and outnumbered. It was the end. ""Welcome to the headquarters of the Big Four, M. Hercule Poirot,"" said Number Four in a mocking tone. ""To meet you again is an unexpected pleasure. But was it worth while returning from the grave only for this?"" Poirot did not reply. I dared not look at him. ""Come this way,"" continued Number Four. ""Your arrival will be somewhat of a surprise to my colleagues."" He indicated a narrow doorway in the wall. We passed through and found ourselves in another chamber.",0
"“I do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardt’s intelligence by telling her.” With a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone. “They are stitched in the lining of that.” “Clever,” murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the door. “Good evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New York whilst you make your getaway.” “Whatta fool!” roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he fired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as I flung myself upon him.",0
"My last letter from the Argentine had given no hint of my intended voyage indeed, that had been decided upon hurriedly as a result of certain business complications and I spent many amused moments picturing to myself his delight and stupefaction on beholding me. He, I knew, was not likely to be far from his headquarters. The time when his cases had drawn him from one end of England to the other was past. His fame had spread, and no longer would he allow one case to absorb all his time.",0
"The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew. We returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee line for the Anchor Inn. “Here we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,” he explained. “You notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I meant it. But no you observed Mrs. Maltravers’ face when she caught sight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he eh bien, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here on Tuesday night the day before Mr. Maltravers died.",0
"“His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily.",0
"Then Number One spoke: “Then all is arranged. We are assured of success?” “I think so.” But the German spoke with less than his usual confidence. Number One’s voice held suddenly a dangerous quality: “What has gone wrong?” “Nothing; but ” “But what?” “The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do nothing. If they do not declare a general strike on the 29th ” “Why should they not?” “As you’ve said, they’re honest.",0
"“But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?” “He’s ill in bed with influenza.” “Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?” And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr.",0
"” A new-born fear passed through his mind that this might, perhaps, be one of those “pretty ways” of making a prisoner speak, which had been attributed to Boris. But on reflection he dismissed the idea. “It’s that sour-faced brute Conrad,” he decided. “That’s a fellow I shall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is just a bit of spite on his part. I’m certain of it.” Further meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be extremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrad’s egg-shaped head.",0
"“Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M. Jack Renauld.” “What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?” “Giraud.” “Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will he will ” She broke off. There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently.",0
"He persuaded me to come over to his side.” Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. “Rats always leaving a sinking ship,” observed Sir Eustace. “I don’t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they’re in the big giraffe’s stomach.",0
"He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter. “Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called ‘book knowledge.",0
"The “Colonel” and his gang must have no suspicion that there existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I knew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to Lord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer “Nadina” who had been delighting Paris for so long. It seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified already but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw how natural it really was. Nadina had never been to England during her successful career in Paris.",0
"“No,” admitted Boris at last sullenly, “you do not.” “Thank God, he’s not a mind reader,” thought Tommy. Aloud he pursued his advantage: “And why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts me in a position to propose a bargain.” “A bargain?” The bearded man took him up sharply. “Yes a bargain. My life and liberty against ” He paused. “Against what?” The group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop. Slowly Tommy spoke. “The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the Lusitania.” The effect of his words was electrical.",0
"He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.",0
"It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa.",0
"""I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that leads us?” “Where we were when we started.” “Jamais de la vie! If the package was thrown overboard, and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in London.” “Yes, but then” Poirot waved an impatient hand. “Permit me to continue.",0
"Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up.",0
"""But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.",0
"” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? Eh bien, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a cause célèbre unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after ” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind.",0
"“At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.” Pagett retired. “By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair’s?” “Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur hats, I think.” “That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They are hats of a kind though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them. I dare say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What else was there?” “Some rolls of films and some baskets a lot of baskets” “There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.",0
"""It depends, monsieur, upon who these friends of yours are."" Without a word, the man drew from his pocket a cigarette case, and, opening it, took out four cigarettes and tossed them on the table. Then he picked them up and returned them to his case, which he replaced in his pocket. ""Aha!"" said Poirot, ""so it is like that, is it? And what do your friends suggest?"" ""They suggest, monsieur, that you should employ your talents your very considerable talents in the detection of legitimate crime return to your former avocations, and solve the problems of London society ladies."" ""A peaceful programme,"" said Poirot. ""And supposing I do not agree?"" The man made an eloquent gesture. ""We should regret it, of course, exceedingly,"" he said.",0
"“I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.” “Has he any relatives in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.” “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?” “That point has not been overlooked.",0
"“At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer, as the son of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in America. It seemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown could be one and the same. But you cannot escape from the logic of facts. Since the thing was so it must be accepted. Remember Mrs. Vandemeyer’s sudden and inexplicable agitation. Another proof, if proof was needed. “I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some words of Mr. Hersheimmer’s at Manchester, I gathered that you had understood and acted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove the impossible possible.",0
"My duties gave me no difficulty whatever. At one period of my life I had been private secretary to a busy member of Parliament, so I was not called upon to assume a role unfamiliar to me. Mr. Ryland usually entertained a large party over the week-end, but the middle of the week was comparatively quiet. I saw very little of Mr. Appleby, the American secretary, but he seemed a pleasant, normal young American, very efficient in his work. Of Miss Martin, the stenographer, I saw rather more.",0
"Since it was to Jack Renauld’s advantage that the body should be found without delay, why dig a grave at all?” Giraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance. Poirot moved towards the door. I followed him. “There is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,” he said over his shoulder. “What is that?” “The piece of lead piping,” said Poirot, and left the room. Jack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we came out of the salon, he looked up sharply. At the same moment there was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was descending it.",0
"I marvelled at Poirot’s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited his next question with impatience, but it disappointed me. “When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into Miss Cynthia’s room bolted?” “Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.” “And the door into Mr. Inglethorp’s room? Did you notice if that was bolted too?” Annie hesitated. “I couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn’t say whether it was bolted or not.” “When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door after you?” “No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it at night. The door into the passage, that is.",0
"” Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily. “It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he remarked lugubriously. I don’t see why it should have and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily. Again I believe he is right.",0
"“No,” he said quietly. “There is still the chance that Dr. Hall may be able to tell us something.” “Gee! I’d forgotten him.” “The chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I told you that he is staying at the Métropole. I should suggest that we call upon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say after a bath and breakfast?” It was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the Ritz, and call for Sir James in the car. This programme was faithfully carried out, and a little after eleven they drew up before the Métropole. They asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy went in search of him.",0
"On the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the grounds. Owing to Albert’s insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal more noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these precautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those of any other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted. Tommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert’s fancy ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested. The blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large company assembled round the table. The port was passing from hand to hand.",0
"The servants noticed nothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in seven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas Dorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as usual or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one found broken in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room. “I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia. I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in her coffee.",0
"“Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress.",0
"Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr.",0
"""Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?” “Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’” “Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head in and withdrawing it immediately. I stood up. “And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked demurely. Harry came close to me. “My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring his neck. And as for you” “Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited. “I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!” “What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically.",0
"Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M.",0
"Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?” “Oh, I don’t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I think.” “Thank you.” Poirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “With your permission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told us all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your subconscious self.",0
"Brown was in the house Hark! what was that? A stealthy footstep on the stairs? There was some one in the house! Absurd! She was becoming hysterical. Jane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She unhooked it with a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and festoons of cobwebs lay between it and the wall. Sir James handed her a pocket-knife, and she ripped away the brown paper from the back The advertisement page of a magazine fell out. Jane picked it up.",0
"I didn’t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide. “It is extraordinary to me,” said the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward. His name and address should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular not to do so.” I smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor. In pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard at an early date. But the next morning brought a surprise.",0
"I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery.",0
"But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily. “Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person you are.” Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. “I must report myself to my chief,” I said demurely. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office middle compartment dictating at an incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.” “This enthusiasm for work is something new,” I commented. “H’m!” said Colonel Race.",0
"I determined to lose no time. Five minutes’ delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in ransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a description of strychnine poisoning. The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I, accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me. It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain his absence? He accosted me eagerly.",0
"All Papa’s friends were aged Professors usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a “neat little waist” and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a “neat little waist” since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always “felled their opponent with a single blow.",0
"cap, and I admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty. She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me. “Sit down here on the grass, do. It’s ever so much nicer.” I dropped down obediently. “You work at Tadminster, don’t you, Miss Murdoch?” She nodded. “For my sins.” “Do they bully you, then?” I asked, smiling. “I should like to see them!” cried Cynthia with dignity.",0
"Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.” “O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?” “Yes, he is an Irishman.” “From what part of Ireland?” “County Clare, I believe.” “Tiens! But proceed, milord.” “The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual.",0
"He would watch events, and any time he chose could, after all, join the assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival. The man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed tread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society. The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young man, though he was a type that Scotland Yard would have recognized at a glance. The man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped at the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock.",0
"I said bolted, meaning that it was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside.” “Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have been locked?” “Oh, yes.” “You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, whether that door was bolted or not?” “I I believe it was.” “But you did not see it?” “No. I never looked.” “But I did,” interrupted Lawrence suddenly. “I happened to notice that it was bolted.” “Ah, that settles it.” And Poirot looked crestfallen.",0
"But it wasn’t till I heard that the order for Tommy’s execution came right on the heels of our interview with him that Sunday that I began to tumble to the fact that he was the big bug himself.” “I never suspected it at all,” lamented Tuppence. “I’ve always thought I was so much cleverer than Tommy but he’s undoubtedly scored over me handsomely.” Julius agreed. “Tommy’s been the goods this trip! And, instead of sitting there as dumb as a fish, let him banish his blushes, and tell us all about it.” “Hear! hear!” “There’s nothing to tell,” said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable.",0
"The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and the political schemes all the stories current were traced back to the lady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the “Crown jewels” the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his wife.",0
"""That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.",0
"You’ve scored over him handsomely.” “That poor Giraud,” said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest. “Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had la mauvaise chance once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for instance. To say the least, it was misleading.” “To tell you the truth, Poirot,” I said slowly, “even now I don’t quite see whose hair was it?” “Madame Renauld’s of course. That is where la mauvaise chance came in. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered.",0
"Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up against civilization.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you make one error.",0
"Was this a hint? What exactly lay behind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all, he had not abandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be working on it still while Her meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to “get right in.” “You’re looking kind of thoughtful,” he remarked as they started off. “Did the old guy say anything more?” Tuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again. Sir James’s words sounded in her ears: “Never tell all you know not even to the person you know best.” And like a flash there came into her mind another memory.",0
"“I must go up to her at once.” “But no, I tell you. It is better not.” “But Marthe and I ” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s arm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was weeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs.",0
"How would it be if you attached little Conrad here to my person. He’s a faithful fellow, and very ready with the fist.” “We prefer,” said the German coldly, “that you should remain here. One of our number will carry out your instructions minutely. If the operations are complicated, he will return to you with a report and you can instruct him further.” “You’re tying my hands,” complained Tommy.",0
"Brown just tickles me to death!” “The idea was not original to them,” said Mr. Carter gravely. “It was suggested, and the poison very carefully instilled, by a past-master in the art. The paragraph in the New York paper suggested the plan to him, and by means of it he wove a web that nearly enmeshed you fatally.” “I never liked him,” said Julius. “I felt from the first that there was something wrong about him, and I always suspected that it was he who silenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely.",0
"Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard which every one would perceive, bien entendu I much prefer that we should voyage together.",0
"I realised then that it was a dead man who was burned."" ""But why? What was the point?"" ""My friend, if you were to shoot a man, or stab a man after he were dead, or even knock him on the head, it would be apparent that the injuries were inflicted after death. But with his head charred to a cinder, no one is going to hunt about for obscure causes of death, and a man who has apparently just escaped being poisoned at dinner, is not likely to be poisoned just afterwards. Who is lying, that is always the question? I decided to believe Ah Ling "" ""What!"" I exclaimed.",0
"""And why is that?"" ""Dash it all, Poirot, you don't think I'm going to leave you all alone when you're up against a thing like the 'Big Four,' do you?"" Poirot nodded gently. ""Just as I thought. You are a staunch friend, Hastings. It is to serve me that you remain on here. And your wife little Cinderella as you call her, what does she say?"" ""I haven't gone into details, of course, but she understands. She'd be the last one to wish me to turn my back on a pal."" ""Yes, yes, she, too, is a loyal friend. But it is going to be a long business, perhaps."" I nodded, rather discouraged.",0
"I wonder if he did find anything in that safe ” Tuppence’s meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed the events of last night carefully and persistently. Somehow, they seemed bound up with Sir James’s enigmatical words Suddenly she gave a great start the colour faded out of her face. Her eyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils dilated. “Impossible,” she murmured. “Impossible! I must be going mad even to think of such a thing” Monstrous yet it explained everything After a moment’s reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each word as she did so.",0
"“So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.",0
"I handed him out half a dollar, and that settled that. I did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach. Whittington was there right enough. When I saw the skunk, with his big sleek fat face, and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt real mad that I hadn’t got a gun with me. I’d have tickled him up some. “We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and gave the name of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes of each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too.",0
"The next moment she had sprung back a pace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs. Vandemeyer’s heart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it. In the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike triumph. “Now who’s on top and who’s underneath?” she crowed. The other’s face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence thought she was going to spring upon her, which would have placed the girl in an unpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the line at actually letting off the revolver. However, with an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled herself, and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face.",0
"We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover where he lives, what he does sleuth him, in fact! Now I can’t do it, because he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons’. He’s not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like another.” “I repudiate that remark utterly. I’m sure my pleasing features and distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.” “My plan is this,” Tuppence went on calmly, “I’ll go alone to-morrow. I’ll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn’t matter if I don’t get any more money at once.",0
"""You considered them practicable?"" ""Perfectly practicable. My own line of research has been somewhat similar, though not undertaken with the same end in view. I have been investigating the gamma rays emitted by the substance usually known as Radium C., a product of Radium emanation, and in doing so I have come across some very interesting magnetical phenomena. Indeed, I have a theory as to the actual nature of the force we call magnetism, but it is not yet time for my discoveries to be given to the world. Mr.",0
"""You don’t think” the Prime Minister hesitated a minute “that it would be better to open it now? Surely we ought to secure the document, that is, provided the young man’s guess turns out to be correct, at once. We can keep the fact of having done so quite secret.” “Can we? I’m not so sure. There are spies all round us. Once it’s known I wouldn’t give that” he snapped his fingers “for the life of those two girls. No, the boy trusted me, and I shan’t let him down.” “Well, well, we must leave it at that, then.",0
"“But for what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made me truly thankful. Amen.” He drew up a chair, and the girl turned away to the door. “Wait a sec,” cried Tommy. “There are lots of things I want to ask you, Annette. What are you doing in this house? Don’t tell me you’re Conrad’s niece, or daughter, or anything, because I can’t believe it.” “I do the service, monsieur. I am not related to anybody.” “I see,” said Tommy. “You know what I asked you just now. Have you ever heard that name?” “I have heard people speak of Jane Finn, I think.” “You don’t know where she is?” Annette shook her head.",0
"No wonder she fainted! But since then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has played her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son’s sake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the criminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s past life.",0
"” John, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the window as it swept past. “Evie!” cried John. “Excuse me, Wells.” He went hurriedly out into the hall. Poirot looked inquiringly at me. “Miss Howard,” I explained. “Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart too, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!” I followed John’s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head.",0
"""They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t think for an instant” Poirot raised his hand. “Tout doucement, mon ami. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see” Poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed to be amusing him vastly. “And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!” “What on earth” “And stars give light! Voilà! Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.",0
"But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.",0
"""It’s closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up, they say. Not that I’ve ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office is to let.” “Th thank you,” faltered Tuppence. “I suppose you don’t know Mr. Whittington’s address?” “Afraid I don’t. They left rather suddenly.” “Thank you very much,” said Tommy. “Come on, Tuppence.” They descended to the street again where they gazed at one another blankly. “That’s torn it,” said Tommy at length. “And I never suspected it,” wailed Tuppence. “Cheer up, old thing, it can’t be helped.” “Can’t it, though!” Tuppence’s little chin shot out defiantly.",0
"Potter as usual?” “I guess that’ll be all right!” said a new voice, with a transatlantic intonation, “though I’d like to point out, here and now, that things are getting a mite difficult. There’s not the sympathy there was, and a growing disposition to let the Irish settle their own affairs without interference from America.” Tommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered: “Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the States?” “The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition,” said the Sinn Feiner.",0
"Giraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said: “That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the interrogatory, M. le juge.” “Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your quarrel?” “I decline to state.” M. Hautet sat up in his chair. “M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered. “What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But another voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I will inform you, if you like, M.",0
"By the way, I got rather an odd request from him the other day.” “Yes?” “He sent me a cutting from some American paper. It referred to a man’s body found near the docks in New York about three weeks ago. He asked me to collect any information on the subject I could.” “Well?” Carter shrugged his shoulders. “I couldn’t get much. Young fellow about thirty-five poorly dressed face very badly disfigured. He was never identified.” “And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?” “Somehow I do. I may be wrong, of course.” There was a pause, then Mr.",0
"Poirot threw an extra log on the fire, and brought forward more easy-chairs. I brought out glasses and the whisky and soda. The captain took a deep draught, and expressed appreciation. ""Legislation in your country is still sound,"" he observed. ""And now to business,"" said Japp. ""Moosior Poirot here made a certain request to me. He was interested in some concern that went by the name of the Big Four, and he asked me to let him know at any time if I came across a mention of it in my official line of business.",0
"The noise he produced was terrific. Presently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally unimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler remonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the butler affectionately as “dear old whiskers.” The footman took him by one arm, the butler by the other. They ran him down the drive, and neatly out of the gate. The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded again. It was beautifully done soberly and with perfect decorum.",0
"“You have tied him up well, hein? He is like a trussed chicken!” The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy; but at that moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand running lightly over his bonds, and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his hand. “Come on, Annette.” “Mais me voilà.” The door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say: “Lock it and give me the key.” The footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The object Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open. From the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action with the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked.",0
"” The well-known glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before Poirot opened the proceedings. I think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative. “Mesdames and messieurs,” said Poirot, bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture, “I have asked you to come here all together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred Inglethorp.",0
"But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M.",0
"But it was absurd of John to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: “I tell you I won’t have it!” I woke up with a start. At once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about twelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing each other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as evidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or speak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream. “I tell you, Mary, I won’t have it.",0
"""Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes.",0
"Their course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible to Oxford Street. When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little he gained upon them. On the crowded pavement there was little chance of his attracting their notice, and he was anxious if possible to catch a word or two of their conversation. In this he was completely foiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually.",0
"I thought to myself, Why not? I am beginning to weary of this unending solving of foolish problems. I have achieved sufficient fame. Let me take this money and settle down somewhere near my old friend."" I was quite affected by this token of Poirot's regard. ""So I accepted,"" he continued, ""and in an hour's time I must leave to catch the boat train. One of life's little ironies, is it not? But I will admit to you, Hastings, that had not the money offered been so big, I might have hesitated, for just lately I have begun a little investigation of my own.",0
"In the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright, very stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack of originality, was also returning to the Ritz via Regent’s Park. A terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them. Without quite knowing what had happened, everything seemed changed. They were tongue-tied paralysed. All the old camaraderie was gone. Tuppence could think of nothing to say. Tommy was equally afflicted. They sat very straight and forbore to look at each other. At last Tuppence made a desperate effort. “Rather fun, wasn’t it?” “Rather.",0
"Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village chemist’s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not employ the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence no shadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist’s assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!” “Still I do not see ” I began.",0
"” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he but what do men care if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.",0
"Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment I had a two-berth one to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the train would start. But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well.",0
"In the pitch darkness of the night, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned reluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police. Lady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a woman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story. “I was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a man sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with such force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him disappearing through the side door.",0
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to the sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish, hiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre décors. In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It was the Manager.",0
"This attitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. Eh bien! from that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be arrested.” “Wait a minute. I don’t see why he wished to be arrested?” “Because, mon ami, it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it was clever his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method.",0
"“But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you why was I not told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child ” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs.",0
"Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.",0
"“I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.",0
"This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000. “On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found to contain knobs of sugar! “Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not know. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields was all a fantasy.",0
"“Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.",0
"” He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. “By the way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.” “Certainly. What is it?” “Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you to say this to him. ‘I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says: “Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!”’ Nothing more. Nothing less.” “‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.’ Is that right?” I asked, much mystified. “Excellent.” “But what does it mean?” “Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.",0
"""How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some magnetic influence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to commit suicide?” Tommy looked at him with respect. “Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But it leaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and blood. I think the gifted young detectives must get to work, study the entrances and exits, and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the mystery dawns on them. Let’s go round to the scene of the crime. I wish we could get hold of Tuppence. The Ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the glad reunion.” Inquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet returned.",0
"The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient greffier sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I I told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed.",0
""" No; there was little fear of finding Hercule Poirot far afield. On arrival in London, I deposited my luggage at an hotel and drove straight on to the old address. What poignant memories it brought back to me! I hardly waited to greet my old landlady, but hurried up the stairs two at a time and rapped on Poirot's door. ""Enter, then,"" cried a familiar voice from within. I strode in. Poirot stood facing me. In his arms he carried a small valise, which he dropped with a crash on beholding me. ""Mon ami, Hastings!"" he cried. ""Mon ami, Hastings!"" And, rushing forward, he enveloped me in a capacious embrace.",0
"“You wouldn’t dare ” “Oh, yes, I would, son!” Kramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried conviction, for he said sullenly: “Well? Granted I do know who you mean what of it?” “You will tell me now right here where she is to be found.” Kramenin shook his head. “I daren’t.” “Why not?” “I daren’t. You ask an impossibility.” “Afraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up! There is such a person, then? I doubted it. And the mere mention of him scares you stiff!” “I have seen him,” said the Russian slowly. “Spoken to him face to face.",0
"Quentin, on the other hand, has an impression that it was closed, but not fastened, but he won't swear either way. If he could, it would make a great difference. If the man was murdered, some one entered the room either through the door or the window if through the door, it was an inside job; if through the window, it might have been any one.",0
"“Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You in company with a friend visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th” The Italian made an angry gesture. “I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court” “Précisément and I have a little idea that you have sworn falsely.” “You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.” “Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you but with publicity.",0
"Poirot was right in many of his claims. The only question is the extent of its aims. I cannot but feel that M. Poirot er exaggerates a little."" For answer Poirot set forth ten salient points. I have been asked not to give them to the public even now, and so I refrain from doing so, but they included the extraordinary disasters to submarines which occurred in a certain month, and also a series of aeroplane accidents and forced landings.",0
"He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite.",0
"Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn’t rattle, and plugged it up again.” Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: “I always did hate that blinking giraffe,” he said. “It must have been instinct.” We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue.",0
"My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings.",0
"It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer.",0
"Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius Hersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately. Tuppence’s spirits revived still more. It would be something to see Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius’s sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst open.",0
"Obeying a sign from the man on the divan, my two jailers brought me back to my old seat facing him. ""You are a brave man, Captain Hastings,"" he said. ""We of the East appreciate bravery. I may say that I expected you to act as you have done. That brings us to the appointed second act of our little drama. Death for yourself you have faced will you face death for another?"" ""What do you mean?"" I asked hoarsely, a horrible fear creeping over me. ""Surely you have not forgotten the lady who is in our power the Rose of the Garden."" I stared at him in dumb agony.",0
"“I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds.",0
"Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed.",0
"A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.” “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?” “My dear sir, I never attended him.” “What?” “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist or something of that kind.” “But you examined the body?” “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.” “And the cause of death was clear?” “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.” “Was he still lying where he had been found?” “Yes, the body had not been touched.",0
"” Mr. Philips’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He passed on to the subject of the note. “You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?” “Not that I know of.” “Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own hand-writing carelessly disguised?” “No, I do not think so.” “I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!” “No.",0
"""I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,” replied Poirot quietly. “Well, then?” “Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.” And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him. This proceeding of Poirot’s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my confidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully restored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp’s innocence had been so triumphantly vindicated. The funeral of Mrs.",0
"When I came through the hall again a few minutes later, it was gone.” This statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me to improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample time to introduce the poison. At that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were sitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark, ferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair. I questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear. “Do you know who that little man is?” I shook my head.",0
"""Impossible!” “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.",0
"Then I saw his glance fasten upon me. He made no sign of recognition, but I was at once aware that he was trying to speak to me. Be he friend or foe, I must hear what he had to say. I leaned over the bed, but the broken sounds conveyed no sort of meaning to me. I thought I caught the word ""hand,"" but in what connection it was used I could not tell. Then it came again, and this time I heard another word, the word ""Largo."" I stared in amazement, as the possible juxtaposition of the two suggested itself to me. ""Handel's Largo?"" I queried.",0
"Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester.",0
"I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my unchanging devotion.” “And you did see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face. There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed.",0
"For the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with M. Renauld père, and pass to the next chronological event.” “May 23rd,” I read, “M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don’t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.” “We agree, mon ami at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M.",0
"I did not know it until afterwards. He was one of a crowd. I should not know him again. Who is he really? I do not know. But I know this he is a man to fear.” “He’ll never know,” said Julius. “He knows everything and his vengeance is swift. Even I Kramenin! would not be exempt!” “Then you won’t do as I ask you?” “You ask an impossibility.” “Sure that’s a pity for you,” said Julius cheerfully. “But the world in general will benefit.” He raised the revolver. “Stop,” shrieked the Russian. “You cannot mean to shoot me?” “Of course I do.",0
"He described the methods of housing the natives, the searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers took. “Then it’s practically impossible to steal any diamonds?” asked Mrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express purpose. “Nothing’s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.” “Yes, but on a large scale?” “Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?” I nodded. “Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld.",0
"What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It looks as though he had some hold over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested in spite of myself. “You don’t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he’s a most capable and hard-working young man.",0
"Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself! I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise. “A la bonne heure, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.” “You are called away on a case, then?” “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr.",0
"If she thinks you want to know her she’s flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.” “You overrate my manly charms,” murmured Tommy. “On the other hand,” proceeded Tuppence, “my millionaire would probably run for his life! No marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains to make money!” “We’ve tried that, and failed,” Tommy reminded her. “We’ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let’s be adventurers!” “Certainly,” replied Tommy cheerfully. “How do we begin?” “That’s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them.",0
"Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream. “My God!” cried Lord Yardly. “That was Maude’s voice! What has happened?” We rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the darkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight met our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck. As we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive, her eyelids opened.",0
"To most people it would have been a treat but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a nice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on.",0
"Fear had successfully hypnotized the man by his side. “Get in,” he ordered. Then as he caught the other’s sidelong glance, “No, the chauffeur won’t help you any. Naval man. Was on a submarine in Russia when the Revolution broke out. A brother of his was murdered by your people. George!” “Yes, sir?” The chauffeur turned his head. “This gentleman is a Russian Bolshevik. We don’t want to shoot him, but it may be necessary. You understand?” “Perfectly, sir.” “I want to go to Gatehouse in Kent.",0
"""And Number Four?"" I asked. ""As I said just now I am beginning to know and understand his methods. You may smile, Hastings but to penetrate a man's personality, to know exactly what he will do under any given circumstances that is the beginning of success. It is a duel between us, and whilst he is constantly giving away his mentality to me, I endeavour to let him know little or nothing of mine. He is in the light, I in the shade. I tell you, Hastings, that every day they fear me the more for my chosen inactivity.",0
"” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him.",0
"“And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.",0
"But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road” “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot. “Yes but how did you know?” “Oh, c’est évident! Continue!” “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur” “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"Monsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a stout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his charming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in which Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although doing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The Beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with. But unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of Romance.",0
"Inglethorp’s recitation receiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which Cynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been acting with her in the tableaux. The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as she was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about 12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party. “Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster’s sister, you know.",0
"“So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.” “En vérité! And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, mon cher?” I thought. “About a dozen times perhaps.” “And I once! Yet I recognize her, and you do not.” “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly. “Ah! Sacré!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.",0
"“Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up.” Tommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little William. It seemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther away. The path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to the sea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy cannoned into him. “What’s up?” he inquired. “Look there. If that doesn’t beat the band!” Tommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge boulder which certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a “begging” terrier.",0
"“Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?” “Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to come there and croak like a frog.” “She’ll know that’s you,” said Tommy with a sigh of relief. “Your imagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you wouldn’t recognize a frog croaking if you heard it.” Albert looked rather crest-fallen. “Cheer up,” said Tommy. “No harm done. That butler’s an old friend of mine I bet he knew who I was, though he didn’t let on. It’s not their game to show suspicion. That’s why we’ve found it fairly plain sailing.",0
"” It was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the pure column of the girl’s white throat, and the bronze masses of hair that crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in every eye, as she took her seat. Soon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord Tommy was called upon for a full and complete explanation. “You’ve been too darned close about the whole business,” Julius accused him. “You let on to me that you were off to the Argentine though I guess you had your reasons for that. The idea of both you and Tuppence casting me for the part of Mr.",0
"How you ever had the nerve to play your part as you did I can’t think.” She stamped her foot. “Get up, I say.” But Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs with incoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to the good. Moreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly nearer to her objective. Mrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked the girl to her knees. “Drink it at once!” Imperiously she pressed the glass to the girl’s lips. Tuppence gave one last despairing moan. “You swear it won’t hurt me?” she temporized. “Of course it won’t hurt you. Don’t be a fool.",0
"And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate.",0
"I had been studying French, and my teacher said they were wanting help in a hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my services, and they were accepted. I hadn’t got any folk of my own, so it made it easy to arrange things. “When the Lusitania was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I’d noticed him more than once and I’d figured it out in my own mind that he was afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I was a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in the Times. If it didn’t appear, I was to take them to the American Ambassador.",0
"We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention to anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study. “I have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my friend,” he deigned to remark. “Now, behold!” Going straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the envelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly hope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care he cut open the envelope, laying it out flat.",0
"And you were right.” I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance. “My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.” “Ended?” “But yes. They are arrested.” “Who are arrested?” “The chambermaid and the valet, parbleu! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?” “You said cabinet-makers used it.” “Certainly they do to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot.",0
"Half a moment, though, isn’t there a door into Miss Cynthia’s rooms?” “Yes, sir, but that’s always bolted. It’s never been undone.” “Well, we might just see.” He ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia’s room. Mary Cavendish was there, shaking the girl who must have been an unusually sound sleeper and trying to wake her. In a moment or two he was back. “No good. That’s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.” We strained and heaved together.",0
"Had he been pumping me? Were those slight inaccuracies just tests to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) There is something to be said for life on board ship. It is peaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar.",0
"""Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock.",0
"What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?” “I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.” “By threats eh? You seriously advance that supposition?” “Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter’s marriage.” “You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the whip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.",0
"The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing.",0
"""Was there no science then in Ancient Egypt?” asked Poirot softly. He did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment. “No, no, do not answer me, but tell me this. What do the native workmen think?” “I guess,” said Dr. Ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads, natives aren’t going to be far behind. I’ll admit that they’re getting what you might call scared but they’ve no cause to be.” “I wonder,” said Poirot non-committally. Sir Guy leant forward. “Surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in oh, but the thing’s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you think that.",0
"“Do you know, I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?” “You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.” “But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?” “Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did yes but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.” “What?” “Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away.",0
"“Well,” said Tommy, refusing to share Julius’s emotion, “it’s what we expected to see, isn’t it?” Julius looked at him sadly and shook his head. “British phlegm! Sure we expected it but it kind of rattles me, all the same, to see it sitting there just where we expected to find it!” Tommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved his feet impatiently. “Push on. What about the hole?” They scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying idiotically: “The gorse won’t be there after all these years.” And Julius replied solemnly: “I guess you’re right.” Tommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.",0
"“I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.",0
"She was mad mad with the madness of genius! Poirot said nothing. His jaw had dropped, and he was staring at her. ""Well,"" she said softly, ""this is the end. WE cannot permit our plans to be interfered with. Have you any last request to make?"" Never before, or since, have I felt so near death. Poirot was magnificent. He neither flinched nor paled, just stared at her with unabated interest. ""Your psychology interests me enormously, madame,"" he said quietly. ""It is a pity that I have so short a time to devote to studying it. Yes, I have a request to make.",0
"By the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the syringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld’s hand. What would he say, the excellent M. Hautet? ‘Poor woman! What did I tell you? The shock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most tragic case, the Renauld Case!’ “However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her. There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil.",0
"""Oh, Julius!” “Well, I don’t want to hustle you any, Jane, but there’s no sense in waiting about. Don’t be scared I shan’t expect you to love me all at once.” But a small hand was slipped into his. “I love you now, Julius,” said Jane Finn. “I loved you that first moment in the car when the bullet grazed your cheek” Five minutes later Jane murmured softly: “I don’t know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very long way from the Savoy to the Ritz?” “It depends how you go,” explained Julius unblushingly.",0
"Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack ma foi! they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his train. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall.",0
"We’ve been threatened with it in plain and unmistakable terms. The Revolutionary element as good as declare that it’s in their hands, and that they intend to produce it at a given moment. On the other hand, they are clearly at fault about many of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff on their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of absolute denial. I’m not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one.",0
"” The typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of a green toque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked P.L.C. He looked an agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter replied to it: “Washed up on the Yorkshire coast near Ebury. I’m afraid it looks very much like foul play.” “My God!” gasped Tommy. “Tuppence! Those devils I’ll never rest till I’ve got even with them! I’ll hunt them down! I’ll ” The pity on Mr. Carter’s face stopped him. “I know what you feel like, my poor boy. But it’s no good. You’ll waste your strength uselessly.",0
""" We went into the living-room, and the sound of the Inspector's footsteps died away outside. Ingles was attracted immediately by some Chinese curios on a table in the corner, and went over to examine them. He seemed to take no interest in Poirot's doings. I, on the other hand, watched him with breathless interest. The floor was covered with a dark-green linoleum which was ideal for showing up footprints. A door at the farther end led into the small kitchen.",0
"In the meantime the fighting goes on.” “I wish,” I said, “that one could be sure that the right people were the ones to get killed. I mean the ones who wanted to fight not just all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the fighting is going on.” He nodded. “I know what you mean, Anne. That’s the unfairness of war. But I’ve other news for you.” “Yes?” “A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to escape.” “What?” “Yes. No one knows how he managed it.",0
"Should have remembered it if it was.” “Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?” “No, don’t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.” “I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper?” He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined in the morning-room at Styles. “Yes, I did.” “How did you come to look for it?” “The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search for it.",0
"But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence or rather lack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which Mrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our efforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that it might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen, in the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from a firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp’s cheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of Russian folksongs.",0
"""Well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of auburn” “Always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!” murmured Poirot. “But continue.” “Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and well, that’s all, I think,” I concluded lamely. “And her husband?” “Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow nothing startling.” “Dark or fair?” “I don’t know betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of face.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, there are hundreds of these average men and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.",0
"What frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us some one he recognized.” “You didn’t see any one?” “No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.” “Nothing unusual in that,” said the inspector dryly. “But he wasn’t a doctor.” “What?” “He wasn’t a doctor,” I repeated. “How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?” “It’s difficult to say, exactly. I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies.",0
"In the meantime, every minute of delay gained was valuable. Mrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the washstand within reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence like a lynx in case the girl should attempt to move, she took a little stoppered bottle from its place on the marble and poured some of its contents into a glass which she filled up with water. “What’s that?” asked Tuppence sharply. “Something to make you sleep soundly.” Tuppence paled a little. “Are you going to poison me?” she asked in a whisper. “Perhaps,” said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably.",0
"I hate being involved. All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral. Guy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working fellow, admirable in every respect. I know no one who annoys me more. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to get rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face.",0
"In feature, little to take hold of, a man difficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of account. He bowed over the dancer’s hand with exaggerated courtliness. “Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.” So much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind her. Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina’s smile. “Compatriots though we are, we will not speak Russian, I think,” she observed. “Since we neither of us know a word of the language, it might be as well,” agreed her guest.",0
""" Poirot was looking round him, frowning unhappily. ""I cannot see light,"" he murmured. ""Just now -yes, I got a gleam, but now all is darkness once more. I have not the clue the motive."" ""Young Gerald Paynter had a pretty good motive,"" remarked Japp grimly. ""He's been wild enough in his time, I can tell you. And extravagant. You know what artists are, too no morals at all."" Poirot did not pay much attention to Japp's sweeping strictures on the artistic temperament. Instead he smiled knowingly. ""My good Japp, is it possible that you throw the mud in my eyes? I know well enough that it is the Chinaman you suspect.",0
"Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was going this afternoon.” To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so! “Enough of this,” he said harshly, rising. “What are you going to do with me?” I asked, still endeavouring to appear composed. “Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you.” For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me.",0
"And the final touch, your own knowledge and belief that there was such a person as Achille Poirot! It was invaluable, the assistance you rendered me, half the success of the coup is due to you! The whole crux of the affair was to make them believe that Hercule Poirot was still at large directing operations. Otherwise, everything was true, the aniseed, the cordon, etc."" ""But why not really send a substitute?"" ""And let you go into danger without me by your side? You have a pretty idea of me there! Besides, I always had a hope of finding a way out through the countess.",0
"“How about the Ritz?” “On second thoughts, I prefer the Piccadilly. It’s nearer. We shan’t have to take another taxi. Come along.” “Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?” inquired Tommy. “Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and the shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental trouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited Hors d’œuvre, Lobster à l’américane, Chicken Newberg, and Pêche Melba! Let’s go and get them!” “Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?” “Oh, unbelieving one!” Tuppence wrenched open her bag.",0
"” I endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of the case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that of Giraud which Poirot despised. I reflected anew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case. Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there I must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up my hypothesis.",0
"But I judged it important to lose no time.” And as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the experiences of the last few days. Half-way through, Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few cryptic orders through the telephone. All traces of displeasure had now left his face. He nodded energetically when Tommy had finished. “Quite right. Every moment’s of value. Fear we shall be too late anyway. They wouldn’t wait. Would clear out at once. Still, they may have left something behind them that will be a clue. You say you’ve recognized Number 1 to be Kramenin? That’s important.",0
"But I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so. “Tiens! A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this charming young lady?” I had to confess that I did not know. “Still more romantic! The first rencontre in the train from Paris, the second here. Journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the saying?” “Don’t be an ass, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!” “It’s all very well to rag me.",0
"I was sure they’d fetch up at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened Julius with the revolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat that to Sir James, so that he wouldn’t worry about us. The moment the girls were out of sight I told Julius to drive like hell for London, and as we went along I told him the whole story. We got to the Soho house in plenty of time and met Mr. Carter outside. After arranging things with him we went in and hid behind the curtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if they were asked, that no one had gone into the house. That’s all.",0
"“Down to Gatehouse, sure. I hope you’re fond of motoring?” “What do you mean? I refuse to go.” “Now don’t get mad. You must see I’m not such a kid as to leave you here. You’d ring up your friends on that telephone first thing! Ah!” He observed the fall on the other’s face. “You see, you’d got it all fixed. No, sir, you’re coming along with me. This your bedroom next door here? Walk right in. Little Willie and I will come behind. Put on a thick coat, that’s right. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we’re ready. We walk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car’s waiting.",0
"There was no strychnine present.” I heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me. “How did you know?” I whispered. “Listen.” “I should say” the doctor was continuing “that I would have been considerably surprised at any other result.” “Why?” “Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be detected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be disguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it.” One of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee. “No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine.",0
"""He has gone to make his little arrangements,"" said Poirot placidly. ""Shall we have our coffee on the terrace, my friend? It would be pleasanter, I think. I will just go up and get a coat."" I went out on to the terrace, a little disturbed in mind. Poirot's assurance did not quite content me. However, so long as we were on our guard, nothing could happen to us. I resolved to keep thoroughly on the alert. It was quite five minutes before Poirot joined me. With his usual precautions against cold, he was muffled up to the ears. He sat down beside me and sipped his coffee appreciatively.",0
"“Look here, and here, and here!” “Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don’t wave Fishers aloft like that!” “They’re not Fishers. They’re five times better than Fishers, and this one’s ten times better!” Tommy groaned. “I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or do I really behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being waved about in a dangerous fashion?” “Even so, O King! Now, will you come and have lunch?” “I’ll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?” “All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is.",0
"But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement.",0
"Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief “Bien, j’y serai” he rang off, and turned to me. “What do you think, mon ami?” He looked half ashamed, half excited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.” “What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?” “This morning, I understand.” I shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me. You see I was right.",0
"There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here.",0
"She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace’s whole life was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had an acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina removed certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the state of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute fears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina, she was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of questionable things in order to get rich, but women shouldn’t pretend to be in love when they aren’t for ulterior motives. I can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive Nadina.",0
"“Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to death!” Then he added seriously: “But say now, I don’t like it, Miss Tuppence, I sure don’t. You’re just as plucky as they make ‘em, but I wish you’d keep right out of this. These crooks we’re up against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day.” “Do you think I’m afraid?” said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly repressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer’s eyes. “I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn’t alter facts.” “Oh, bother me!” said Tuppence impatiently. “Let’s think about what can have happened to Tommy.",0
"He’ll tell me anything he knows.” “Thank you.” Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It impelled her to more audacious efforts. “There’s one thing more.” “Well?” Tuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice. “Who is Mr. Brown?” Her quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her former manner. But the attempt was a mere parody. She shrugged her shoulders. “You can’t have learnt much about us if you don’t know that nobody knows who Mr. Brown is” “You do,” said Tuppence quietly.",0
"“Pardon, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.",0
"But she has intuitive flashes that might be dangerous She must be got out of the way I can do nothing with the American. He suspects and dislikes me. But he cannot know. I fancy my armour is impregnable Sometimes I fear I have underestimated the other boy. He is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to facts” Mr. Carter shut the book. “A great man,” he said. “Genius, or insanity, who can say?” There was silence. Then Mr. Carter rose to his feet. “I will give you a toast. The Joint Venture which has so amply justified itself by success!” It was drunk with acclamation.",0
"""So you want to come in on this case?"" ""I admit it. So skilfully have you aroused my interest."" ""That's fine. Got you away from your brooding. Captain Hastings is pleased, too, I can see."" ""Quite right,"" I said, laughing. Poirot turned back towards the body. ""No other little detail you can tell me about him?"" he asked. ""I don't think so."" ""Not even that he was left-handed?"" ""You're a wizard, Moosior Poirot. How did you know that? He was left-handed. Not that it's anything to do with the case."" ""Nothing whatever,"" agreed Poirot hastily, seeing that Japp was slightly ruffled.",0
"Besides, he wouldn’t mind if he did. He was beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said. Old Julius had taken them jolly well. He’d apologize if he found him there. But the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the writing-table, and opened the middle drawer. A photograph, carelessly thrust in face upwards, caught his eye. For a moment he stood rooted to the ground. Then he took it out, shut the drawer, walked slowly over to an arm-chair, and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand.",0
"Also I wanted to ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received?” Lady Yardly shook her head regretfully. “I’m afraid I don’t. It is stupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them seriously.” “You’ll stay the night?” said Lord Yardly. “Oh, milord, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at the inn.” “That’s all right.” Lord Yardly had his cue. “We’ll send down for them. No, no no trouble, I assure you.",0
"It seemed to her, as she did so, that the tension of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s attitude relaxed. “I see,” she remarked at length. “Is there anyone I can write to for a reference?” “I lived last with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I was with her two years.” “And then you thought you would get more money by coming to London, I suppose? Well, it doesn’t matter to me. I will give you £50 £60 whatever you want. You can come in at once?” “Yes, ma’am. To-day, if you like. My box is at Paddington.” “Go and fetch it in a taxi, then. It’s an easy place. I am out a good deal.",0
"First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had got what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls. There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident. That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and when Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me. “Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest.",0
"On the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her “lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. To intimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political intrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. There was also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with herself acting as the go-between. Amongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young lawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating Jeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the young man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her complete devotion to her middle-aged husband.",0
"I ask you again, will you write this letter?"" ""I will not, and what's more, you daren't kill me. You'd have the police on your tracks in no time."" My interlocutor clapped his hands swiftly. Two Chinese attendants appeared as it were out of the blue, and pinioned me by both arms. Their master said something rapidly to them in Chinese, and they dragged me across the floor to a spot in one corner of the big chamber. One of them stooped, and suddenly, without the least warning, the flooring gave beneath my feet.",0
"“But I guess there’ll be another little picnic soon. Ah!” He raised his hand to his cheek. “You are hurt?” said Annette quickly. “Only a scratch.” The girl sprang to her feet. “Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they’re after. I’m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let me go.” She was fumbling with the fastenings of the door. Julius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken with no trace of foreign accent. “Sit down, kid,” he said gently. “I guess there’s nothing wrong with your memory.",0
"Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.” I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question.",0
"Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight hours and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes a faint scratching sound came to my ears. Poirot’s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there. Poirot placed his lips to my ear. “Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast. Be careful, he will have a knife.” Presently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light appeared through the door.",0
"All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full, stood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar, the other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding cigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table. I enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I wondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked him. “Mon ami,” he replied, “you miss the point. I am looking for something that I do not see.",0
"” Her hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve herself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs across the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her. As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the open boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following scrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself: “Then you won’t show it to me?” To which Mrs. Inglethorp replied: “My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.” “Then show it to me.” “I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the least.",0
"I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive type of mind. Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes. “You are not pleased with me, mon ami?” “My dear Poirot,” I said coldly, “it is not for me to dictate to you. You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.” “A most admirable sentiment,” remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his feet.",0
"Then we emerged into a fertile valley, which continued for some miles, and then, still winding steadily upwards, the bare rocky peaks began to show with dense clustering pine woods at their base. The whole place was wild and lovely. Finally a series of abrupt curves, with the road running through the pine woods on either side, and we came suddenly upon a big hotel and found that we had arrived. Our rooms had been reserved for us, and under Harvey's guidance we went straight up to them.",0
"""Curious case."" ""Brain fever?"" I suggested. The doctor immediately snorted with contempt. ""Brain fever! Brain fever! No such thing as brain fever. An invention of novelists. No; the man's had a shock of some kind. He's come here under the force of a persistent idea to find M. Hercule Poirot, 14 Farraway Street and he repeats those words mechanically without in the least knowing what they mean."" ""Aphasia?"" I said eagerly. This suggestion did not cause the doctor to snort quite as violently as my last one had done. He made no answer, but handed the man a sheet of paper and a pencil. ""Let's see what he'll do with that,"" he remarked.",0
"But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a penknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking for. “But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper on him. He may be seen leaving the room he may be searched. If the paper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute, too, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the boudoir. He must act quickly.",0
"“I wonder if we’ve time to pick up Cynthia. No, she’ll have started from the hospital by now.” “Cynthia! That’s not your wife?” “No, Cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s, the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.” As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house. A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed, straightened herself at our approach.",0
"” Everybody has been at me, right and left, to write this story from the great (represented by Lord Nasby) to the small (represented by our late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in England. “Lor’, miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all just like the pictures!”). I’ll admit that I’ve certain qualifications for the task. I was mixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick of it all through, and I was triumphantly “in at the death.",0
"“How did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?” Poirot smiled placidly at him. “Ah, mon ami, after your wire, it was a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable.",0
"Bargained with us! And all the time it was bluff! Bluff! You know less than a kitten. But your number’s up now all right, you b swine.” Tommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed. Somehow or other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his pretensions. Suddenly a thought occurred to him. “A very good speech, Conrad,” he said approvingly. “But wherefore the bonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat without delay?” “Garn,” said Number 14 unexpectedly.",0
"” Sir James and Julius accompanied her to the door. “Where’s the key? Oh, of course, I’ve got it myself.” She put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused. “Supposing, after all, she’s escaped?” she murmured in a whisper. “Plumb impossible,” replied Julius reassuringly. But Sir James said nothing. Tuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of relief as she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed. “Good morning,” she remarked cheerfully. “I’ve brought you some tea.” Mrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds.",0
"We were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s announcement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up from the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and announced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28. I looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to the station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost importance that he should know at once of the new and startling developments in the case. Evidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he wanted in Paris.",0
"“Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won’t disguise?” “Well, we’ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities. He’s admittedly one of the world’s greatest toxicologists ” “One of the world’s greatest what? Say it again.” “He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,” I explained. “Well, my idea is, that perhaps he’s found some way of making strychnine tasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.” “H’m, yes, that might be,” said John.",0
"“You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well.",0
"Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the Lusitania, the staff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving to take up her billet, and at not hearing from her in any way. “Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady but all in vain. We tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard of her after she set foot in England. No use was made of the draft treaty as might very easily have been done and we therefore came to the conclusion that Danvers had, after all, destroyed it.",0
"“I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?” “Mon ami I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering Léonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I decided on the latter. So I made my guess and I was right.” “And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?” Poirot smiled. “At any rate I saw that she had anxious eyes.",0
"“Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty.",0
"Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.” “H’m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,” I remarked. “For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend himself except by silence?” “Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,” cried Poirot. “See; say that it is I who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible stories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp’s stony denials!” I could not help laughing.",0
"It never occurred to me.” Tommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he judged the heat had done its work. Then he withdrew it. A moment later he uttered a cry. Across the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words: WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN. FOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly, dazed with the shock. Somehow, inexplicably, Mr. Brown had forestalled them. Tommy accepted defeat quietly. Not so Julius. “How in tarnation did he get ahead of us? That’s what beats me!” he ended up. Tommy shook his head, and said dully: “It accounts for the stitches being new.",0
"""Yes, I suppose so.” “Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.” “Indeed,” said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he added rather hesitatingly: “Shall we have to appear as witnesses all of us, I mean?” “You, of course and ah er Mr. er Inglethorp.” A slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner: “Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of form.” “I see.” A faint expression of relief swept over John’s face. It puzzled me, for I saw no occasion for it. “If you know of nothing to the contrary,” pursued Mr.",0
"They had collected a Gladys Mary and a Marjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and had been forced to listen to a long lecture on universal suffrage from a vivacious American lady whose Christian name had proved to be Sadie. “Ah!” said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, “I feel better. Where’s the next draw?” The notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it up. “Mrs. Vandemeyer,” she read, “20 South Audley Mansions. Miss Wheeler, 43 Clapington Road, Battersea.",0
"Nevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the English papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details. Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole matter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance. The remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot’s point of view struck me at once. “Poirot,” I said, “I congratulate you.",0
"I will put down my little case until I need it.” He did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and precipitated the despatch-case on the floor. “Eh voilà une table!” cried Poirot. “Ah, my friend, one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort.” After which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search. A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the writing-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar, however.",0
"There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending over him. “Did you hit him again?” I called breathlessly. “There was no need,” he replied grimly. “I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands. Rayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation.",0
"Your London and South Western road.” “Waterloo?” frowned Tuppence. “Why, yes. Didn’t he tell you?” “I haven’t seen him either,” replied Tuppence impatiently. “Go on about Waterloo. What were you doing there?” “He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and hustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.” “Oh!” said Tuppence, her eyes opening. “I see. Go on.” “I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed out the crooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy shoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars. He was going to sleuth the other crook.",0
"” The doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the examining magistrate. “A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.” “And so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “Could it possibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among themselves.” Giraud shook his head. “The man is a Frenchman I would take my oath of that ” But at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression.",0
"It might just as easily have been a grey hair and then, by no conceivable effort could Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack Renauld! But it is all of a piece.",0
"We want something against him badly to prevent the Cabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about the others? You say two faces were familiar to you? One’s a Labour man, you think? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot him.” A minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some surprise. “Ah, Westway! Shouldn’t have thought it. Poses as being moderate. As for the other fellow, I think I can give a good guess.” He handed another photograph to Tommy, and smiled at the other’s exclamation. “I’m right, then. Who is he? Irishman. Prominent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of course.",0
"A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown” was returned, and the police (and the Daily Budget_) were left to look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out.",0
"Even to Pagett. I happened to hear that he or rather Mrs. Pagett had brought a sixth child into the world the other day. England will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the child a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness to act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post card straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face! Bless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you have made in not marrying me. Yours ever, Eustace Pedler. Harry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not see eye to eye.",0
"Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others. “Mother!” “Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what brings you here? You were to sail on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others, she turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.",0
"“You think he’d get after her? Between now and to-morrow morning. How could he know, even?” “You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,” said Sir James dryly. “We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due care, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our hands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness, but she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.",0
"On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely. It was rather a knotty problem. “We’ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,” I said. “And it’s not too late for morning tea,” said Suzanne. “We’ll have it in the lounge.” The Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated “eleven-o’clock tea.",0
"Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along. Hence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected. My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in another moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He beamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced me warmly on the platform. “Mon cher ami, I have succeeded but succeeded to a marvel!” “Indeed? I’m delighted to hear it.",0
"Tell me, has it never occurred to you that an organisation of this kind, with ramifications all over the world, might easily strike at us through that little girl, Cinderella, whom you love so well?"" ""No, never,"" I replied. ""Well, it did to me. I said nothing to you because I did not want to upset you unnecessarily but I took measures of my own. Your wife's letters all seem to have been written from the ranch, but in reality she has been in a place of safety devised by me for over three months."" I looked at him for a long time. ""You are sure of that?"" ""Parbleu! I know it.",0
"""Not earlier? Couldn’t it have been about half-past three?” “No, I shouldn’t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after four not before it.” “Thank you, Manning, that will do,” said Poirot pleasantly. The gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed cautiously out of the window. We all looked at each other. “Good heavens!” murmured John. “What an extraordinary coincidence.” “How a coincidence?” “That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!” Mr.",0
"” The servant volunteered her first remark: “I thought perhaps as you’d come about the gas,” she observed cryptically, and shut the door. Tommy rejoined his accomplice. “You see, Tuppence,” he observed. “Child’s play to the masculine mind.” “I don’t mind admitting that for once you’ve scored handsomely. I should never have thought of that.” “Good wheeze, wasn’t it? And we can repeat it ad lib.” Lunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in an obscure hostelry with avidity.",0
"“Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?” “Enchanted, madame.” All the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me that in some way she was nervous of Poirot’s eyes. The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports coat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like some great giant sighing. We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong. Dorcas came running out to meet us.",0
"” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly.",0
"Inglethorp. The prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called Marston’s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note, couched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner had, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced as evidence.",0
"Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess.",0
"Renauld will don the tramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave, unnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him. “You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella. Every moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon as he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression that the assassins left that way.",0
"He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with empressement. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible.",0
"I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the tram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying the sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream sodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the hotel. To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from the curator of the Museum.",0
" I think not, mon ami! One does not catch Hercule Poirot as easily as that."" ""Good heavens,"" I gasped. Poirot was frowning to himself. ""There is still one thing I do not understand."" ""What is that?"" ""The time, Hastings the time. If they wanted to decoy me away, surely night time would be better? Why this early hour? Is it possible that something is about to happen this morning? Something which they are anxious Hercule Poirot should not know about?"" He shook his head. ""We shall see. Here I sit, mon ami. We do not stir out this morning. We await events here.",0
"The last thing I heard was his voice saying: ‘That’s not bluff! Anyway, a kid of her age wouldn’t know enough.’ I guess he forgot American girls are older for their age than English ones, and take more interest in scientific subjects. “When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She’d had her orders, I guess. She spoke to me in French told me I’d had a shock and been very ill. I should be better soon. I pretended to be rather dazed murmured something about the ‘doctor’ having hurt my wrist. She looked relieved when I said that.",0
"He felt sure that the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a surprise. About twelve o’clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was told that some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant proved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud. “Well, my good fellow, what is it?” asked Tommy. “Might this be for you, sir?” The carter held out a very dirty folded note, on the outside of which was written: “Take this to the gentleman at the inn near Astley Priors.",0
"""Well, I suppose you're right, but I can't understand any one running a risk he could so easily avoid."" ""Risk!"" Poirot snorted. ""Where then lay the risk? Would Japp have solved the problem? No; if Number Four had not made one small mistake he would have run no risk."" ""And his mistake?"" I asked, although I suspected the answer. ""Mon ami, he overlooked the little gray cells of Hercule Poirot."" Poirot has his virtues, but modesty is not one of them. It was mid-January a typical English winter day in London, damp and dirty. Poirot and I were sitting in two chairs well drawn up to the fire.",0
"That’s all.” Tuppence rose. “I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you for, Mr. Carter?” Mr. Carter’s lips twitched slightly, but he replied succinctly: “Funds within reason, detailed information on any point, and no official recognition. I mean that if you get yourselves into trouble with the police, I can’t officially help you out of it. You’re on your own.” Tuppence nodded sagely. “I quite understand that. I’ll write out a list of the things I want to know when I’ve had time to think. Now about money ” “Yes, Miss Tuppence.",0
"I fished about until I found some old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over my bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth. The whole effect pleased me very much. “Anna the Adventuress,” I said aloud, nodding at my reflection. “Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, ‘The House in Kensington’!” Girls are foolish things. In the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored. Mrs.",0
"""That’s another story,” I quoted. “My story. And I’m going to tell it you now.” Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been in my possession or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds.",0
"There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love.” “Eh eh! The sentimentality,” warned Poirot. “Where one hates one also loves,” I quoted or misquoted. “At any rate he finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old wrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave.",0
"I twisted a dagger from his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes, whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man nodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive followed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were out in the street, Poirot turned to me. “There is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the revolver.",0
"” Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required.",0
"It was as though he had seen something that turned him to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I could see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely harmless enough. The violence of Mrs. Inglethorp’s attack seemed to be passing. She was able to speak in short gasps. “Better now very sudden stupid of me to lock myself in.” A shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing near the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting the girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself.",0
"I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “After all, it does not matter now.” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son.",0
"“Suppose you tell me” There was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter’s personality. Tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said: “We couldn’t do that, could we, Tommy?” But to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of deference. “I dare say the little we know won’t be any good to you, sir. But such as it is, you’re welcome to it.” “Tommy!” cried out Tuppence in surprise. Mr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question. Tommy nodded. “Yes, sir, I recognized you at once.",0
"I phoned Scotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland Yard were very civil said they would make inquiries, even sent a man round this morning to get her photograph. I’m off to Paris to-morrow, just to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro hustling them, they ought to get busy!” The energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before it.",0
"What about food?” “A little starvation will do no harm. The ‘Colonel’ will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely tied up?” The Dutchman laughed. “What do you think?” They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I beat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time the Kafir stirred and moved.",0
"And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on her it would be very surprising! Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, Célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily. “If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie!” she declared heatedly. “I never so much as saw them.” “Search her!” screamed the other. “You will find it is as I say.” “You’re a liar do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon her.",0
"I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement.",0
"She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily addressed as “Nibs.” “What a lot of bottles!” I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the small room. “Do you really know what’s in them all?” “Say something original,” groaned Cynthia. “Every single person who comes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does not say: ‘What a lot of bottles!’ And I know the next thing you’re going to say is: ‘How many people have you poisoned?’” I pleaded guilty with a laugh.",0
"A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which she proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat enigmatical remark: “I’m not really here to-day.” Cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge. “This should have been sent up this morning.” “Sister is very sorry. She forgot.” “Sister should read the rules outside the door.” I gathered from the little nurse’s expression that there was not the least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to the dreaded “Sister”.",0
"Finally John Cavendish, finding his persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife followed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to think better of it. As she left the room, Miss Howard’s face changed. She leant towards me eagerly. “Mr. Hastings, you’re honest. I can trust you?” I was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her voice to a whisper. “Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They’re a lot of sharks all of them. Oh, I know what I’m talking about.",0
"She arrived punctually a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour. “My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,” she began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.” “If you please, mademoiselle.” “I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire.",0
"” A veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next half-hour. Suffice it to say that no such person as “Inspector Brown” was known to Scotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of the utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery. Once again “Mr. Brown” had triumphed. The immediate result of this set-back was to effect a rapprochement between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All barriers went down with a crash, and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young American all their lives.",0
"The 'special table' was an extremely cunning piece of mechanism. The table I examined was a duplicate, perfectly innocent. It was substituted for the other immediately after the murder. The thing was worked from the flat below, which, if you remember, was let furnished. But one accomplice at least was in Savaronoff's flat. The girl is an agent of the Big Four, working to inherit Savaronoff's money."" ""And Ivan?"" ""I strongly suspect that Ivan is none other than the famous Number Four."" ""What?"" ""Yes. The man is a marvellous character actor.",0
"She presented an extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr. Opalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials stood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An hotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the fire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman, obviously Mrs. Opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands, with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress. Into this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling.",0
"Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.",0
"Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and we all went to my mother-in-law’s room, but it was locked ” The Coroner interrupted her. “I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before.” “I?” There was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as she did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind: “She is gaining time!” “Yes.",0
"“You permit that I see whether it matches?” With a cry she started backwards, white to the lips. “It is false I swear it. I know nothing of the crime of either crime. Any one who says I do lies! Ah! mon Dieu, what shall I do?” “Calm yourself, madame,” said Giraud coldly. “No one has accused you as yet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.” “Anything you wish, monsieur.” “Look at the dead man.",0
"He’s been butting in somewhere where he wasn’t wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don’t give up hope.” “And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn’t want me to come,” she added by way of explanation. “H’m,” said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen glance. “And why was that?” “I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little business like this.” “I see.” He paused a moment. “This petty little business, as you call it, bears directly on a very big business, bigger perhaps than either you or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is alive, he may have very valuable information to give us.",0
"She was middle-aged, and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call “une maitresse femme.” She greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head. “Pray be seated, monsieurs.” We took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a round table. “I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night?” “Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly assassins are to be caught and punished.",0
"” Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows. “And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out to-day, as you only came yesterday.” “I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma’am.” Mrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled. “I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion about you last night.” Her smile broadened, catlike. “Your request is very typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand all this but you can go out to-day. It makes no difference to me, as I shall not be dining at home.",0
"The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed to die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully I crept down the stairs.",0
"""Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again in any other disguise, I mean?” asked Suzanne. I shook my head ruefully. “I certainly didn’t recognize him as the stewardess, and never should have but for your drawing.” “The man’s a professional actor, I’m sure of it,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “His make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you’d never spot him.” “You’re very cheering,” I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. “What is Sir Eustace doing?” asked Suzanne. “I haven’t seen him about to-day.",0
"""And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room?” “When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o’clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came up to bed before I’d finished.” “Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing on the table in the left wing?” “Yes, sir.” Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and now she blurted out unexpectedly: “And if there was salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. I never took the salt near it.” “What makes you think there was salt in it?” asked Poirot. “Seeing it on the tray, sir.” “You saw some salt on the tray?” “Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked.",0
"That would make four, wouldn't it? He might think they were all in league against him."" ""Quite so, quite so,"" said Poirot, in a preoccupied voice. ""What about food? Could you take no precautions about that?"" ""I'm always doing what I can. But, of course, sometimes Mrs. Templeton insists on bringing him his food herself, and then there are the times when I am off duty."" ""Exactly. And you are not sure enough of your ground to go to the police?"" The nurse's face showed her horror at the mere idea. ""What I have done, M. Poirot, is this. Mr. Templeton had a very bad attack after partaking of a bowl of soup.",0
"The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “Eh bien, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.",0
"""I suppose you will explain things clearly there, and let the police have a full description of Number Four."" ""And to what end? Can we produce anything to impress a coroner's jury of your solid Britishers? Is our description of Number Four of any value? No; we shall allow them to call it 'Accidental Death,' and may be, although I have not much hope, our clever murderer will pat himself on the back that he deceived Hercule Poirot in the first round."" Poirot was right as usual.",0
"And then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris, was sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and, without revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of the crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at Madame Beroldy’s instigation. The crime had been planned between them.",0
"""Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter?” The wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner’s frown. “Oh, no, sir of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the Hall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a dog.” Inwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please “The Hall” especially when it might result in custom being transferred from Coot’s to the local establishment. “Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?” “Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.",0
"In the same way, we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of that at the inquest but now it has a very different significance. We must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually, or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your account, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.” “Yes, that is so.” I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart. Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion. “In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,” continued Poirot, “I have been obliged to show my hand sooner than I intended.",0
"Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence crept noiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she had thought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were plainly audible. Tuppence listened attentively, but there was no mention of anything that could be twisted to apply to Tommy. Mrs. Vandemeyer and the Russian seemed to be at variance over some matter, and finally the latter exclaimed bitterly: “With your persistent recklessness, you will end by ruining us!” “Bah!” laughed the woman.",0
"It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M.",0
"""He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.” “But no notecase.” “Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.” I tried another tack. “You don’t think it’s odd that the doctor never came forward afterwards?” “A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers. He probably forgot all about the accident.” “In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I said sweetly. “Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know fond of mysteries and such-like. But as I’m a busy man” I took the hint and rose.",0
"Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound and you are a dead man, remember.’ “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.” “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?” “None whatever, monsieur.” “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?” “Yes. I had seen the change in him.",0
"""Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position.",0
"“So, having pardon the expression rather made a mess of things, don’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?” “And the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the chef of Lord Yardly has prepared?” “Oh, what’s dinner!” I said impatiently. Poirot held up his hands in horror. “Mon Dieu! It is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference.” “There’s another reason why we should get back to London as soon as possible,” I continued. “What is that, my friend?” “The other diamond,” I said, lowering my voice. “Miss Marvell’s.” “Eh bien, what of it?” “Don’t you see?” His unusual obtuseness annoyed me.",0
"""You are the Asylum, yes? I understand there has been an escape to-day? What is that you say? A little moment, if you please. Will you repeat that? Ah! parfaitement."" He hung up the receiver, and turned to me. ""You heard, Hastings? There has been no escape."" ""But the man who came the keeper?"" I said. ""I wonder I very much wonder."" ""You mean ?"" ""Number Four the destroyer."" I gazed at Poirot dumbfounded. A minute or two after, on recovering my voice, I said: ""We shall know him again, anywhere, that's one thing. He was a man of very pronounced personality."" ""Was he, mon ami? I think not.",0
"I regard myself as a consulting specialist.” Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand or rather tell me where to lay my hand on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.” Poirot considered. “Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now the facts.” “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual.",0
"Taking him into my confidence would be the best thing either way, so I told him everything except where I believed the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the track of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept my mind open between the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from Tuppence and I knew!” “But how?” Tommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it round the table. “It’s her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn’t from her because of the signature. She’d never spell her name ‘Twopence,’ but anyone who’d never seen it written might quite easily do so.",0
"""Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden.",0
"I was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her.",0
"“Messieurs, mesdames,” said Poirot, with a flourish, “let me introduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!” “Poirot, you old villain,” I said, “I’ve half a mind to strangle you! What do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?” We were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In the room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred Inglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot to myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity. Poirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said: “I did not deceive you, mon ami.",0
"Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed.” That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I got it all out of him, little by little.",0
"” Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: “We thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson she’s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too came hurrying down the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said. ‘But it’s no good. It’s already let.’ That seemed to finish it, but well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium.",0
"With a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted. “Quick in here.” Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so. “And you behind the curtain.” “Si, signor,” said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window. Not a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form. “Where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance.",0
"""You do not see, Hastings, no? But surely now we can prepare ourselves for some of their methods of attack now that we are warned of some of our faults. For instance my friend, we know that you should think before you act. Again, if you meet a red-haired young woman in trouble you should eye her what you say askance, is it not?"" Their notes had contained some absurd references to my supposed impulsiveness, and had suggested that I was susceptible to the charms of young women with hair of a certain shade. I thought Poirot's reference to be in the worst of taste, but fortunately I was able to counter him. ""And what about you?"" I demanded.",0
"But Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that possibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary, Mrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death. So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner proceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress’s bell, and had subsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the quarrel on the preceding afternoon.",0
"Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.",0
"But, my God! what’s going to happen about Bella?” “If I were you,” said Poirot frankly, “I should not distress myself unduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the crime passionnel. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you ” “I don’t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I do feel guilty of my father’s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this girl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat.",0
"I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings.",0
"I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the middle of the cabin. A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it under the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other hand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it was supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from her trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be suspected of harbouring a fugitive.",0
"’ That will intrigue him, the good Japp! His eyes will open wide wide! He will not comprehend in the slightest until to-morrow, or the next day!” I remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend’s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank. Before we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and Japp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was Poirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of my friend.",0
"The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal blood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination. It was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy’s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the outskirts of Lyons.",0
"“An idiot of a steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a moment!” “Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. “He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires you very much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.” “I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable than a hat.” I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race.",0
"What’s the best place to stay at for the night round here?” Mrs. Sweeny looked doubtful. “There’s the Yorkshire Arms, but it’s not much of a place for gentlemen like you.” “Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you’ve not had a young lady here asking for this key to-day?” The woman shook her head. “No one’s been over the place for a long time.” “Thanks very much.” They retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door swung back on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a match and examined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.",0
"“Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.” Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion.",0
"You may laugh if you like, but I’m not going to be this blasted old Men-her-Ra’s next victim. He’ll get me if I stop here.” The young man wiped the perspiration from his brow. Poirot turned away. Over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile: “Remember, he got one of his victims in New York.” “Oh, hell!” said Mr. Harper forcibly. “That young man is nervous,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “He is on the edge, but absolutely on the edge.” I glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me nothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were taken round the excavations.",0
"What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real. Just at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would not have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. With a short laugh he released me. “What’s your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet.",0
"“Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?” “You wouldn’t like it if they did,” I assured her. “To tell you the truth, I’m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as I was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.” Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. “And what are we all doing now?” she asked. “I don’t quite know,” I said thoughtfully.",0
"Seeing as he was in a great to-do and with all that quite the gentleman I brought up ’is card.” She handed me the bit of pasteboard. “Mr. Roger Havering,” I read. Poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently pulled forth “Who’s Who.” Poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly. “Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb.” “H’m!” I said. “I rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at the Frivolity only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember she married some young man about town just before the War.",0
"My friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful face upon me. “Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier? His system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “Quelle idée! You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.",0
"I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly.",0
"But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections.",0
"The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible but nothing has been discovered!” At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.” The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew. “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C.",0
"His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward to assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him affectionately, and remarked in a slightly affected voice: “Pay the thing, will you, old bean? I’ve got nothing smaller than a five-pound note!” THE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been. To begin with, the resources of Tommy’s pockets were somewhat limited.",0
"“Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. Célestine leaves the room again, and pst! in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer. “Madame arrives, the theft is discovered.",0
"“Did you see Sir Eustace?” I asked. “He was marching out of the breakfast room as we went in. He’d had some bad fish or something and was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and he bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was only it wasn’t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.” Suzanne smiled. “Sir Eustace doesn’t like getting up early any more than I do. But, Anne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage. He’s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?” “Only trying to push me overboard,” I replied nonchalantly. It was a distinct score for me.",0
"I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll.",0
"He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for them. I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and airily trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously. That is what makes him so difficult to live with. Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence. He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there.",0
"His position was desperate. At eight o’clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring to his feet. The girl was alone. “Shut the door,” he commanded. “I want to speak to you.” She obeyed. “Look here, Annette, I want you to help me get out of this.” She shook her head. “Impossible. There are three of them on the floor below.” “Oh!” Tommy was secretly grateful for the information. “But you would help me if you could?” “No, monsieur.” “Why not?” The girl hesitated. “I think they are my own people. You have spied upon them. They are quite right to keep you here.",0
"It is retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to have been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o’clock, whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening.” “Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in that?” “No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed.",0
"""Oh! Monsieur Poirot, I am so glad, so thankful. I have heard of you, of course. You will not be like these Scotland Yard people, who will not listen or try to understand. And the French Police are just as bad worse, I think. They are all convinced that my husband has gone off with some other woman. But he wasn't like that! All he thought of in life was his work. Half our quarrels came from that. He cared for it more than he did for me."" ""Englishmen, they are like that,"" said Poirot soothingly. ""And if it is not work, it is the games, the sport. All those things they take au grand sérieux.",0
"Anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he’d murder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he’s done it. And all you can do is to murmur silly things about ‘heart seizure’ and ‘inquest on Friday.’ You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.” “What do you want me to do?” asked John, unable to help a faint smile. “Dash it all, Evie, I can’t haul him down to the local police station by the scruff of his neck.” “Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He’s a crafty beggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers.",0
"No, I swore to myself that I’d take better care of you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this island. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come and look after you. She’s loyal. She’ll never say a word. I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know.” I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know! How some words please one! “You did quite right,” I said quietly. “And I shall not send word to any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn’t make much difference. It’s not as though they were my own people.",0
"Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.",0
"“Good Lord, yes! There’s this terrible business to start with. Scotland Yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know where they won’t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in the country damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame Tussaud’s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing. Pretty thick, isn’t it?” “Cheer up, John!” I said soothingly. “It can’t last for ever.” “Can’t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again.",0
"Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there, with the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no connection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and loneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said awkwardly: “Marry me, Cynthia.” Unwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat up at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity: “Don’t be silly!” I was a little annoyed. “I’m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife.",0
"“Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?” “You consider him a rich man, doctor?” The doctor looked rather surprised. “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.” “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly. The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly. “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe.",0
"Then, with a good many bows and gesticulations on Poirot's part, we bade farewell to the lady and got away. ""Do you really think this photograph so important?"" I asked Poirot. ""Yes, mon ami. The camera does not lie. One can magnify a photograph, seize salient points that otherwise would remain unnoticed. And then there are a thousand details such as the structure of the ears, which no one could ever describe to you in words. Oh, yes, it is a great chance, this which has come our way! That is why I propose to take precautions.",0
"""Japp has his theory, I can see."" ""I have, Moosior Poirot. I don't believe the poison was meant for Wilson it was meant for the other man."" ""Savaronoff?"" ""Yes. Savaronoff fell foul of the Bolsheviks at the outbreak of the Revolution. He was even reported killed. In reality he escaped, and for three years endured incredible hardships in the wilds of Siberia. His sufferings were so great that he is now a changed man. His friends and acquaintances declare they would hardly have recognised him. His hair is white, and his whole aspect that of a man terribly aged.",0
"Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man, with slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand. “Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished speaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?” Poirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.",0
"And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a woman’s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday evening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and Bauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed? Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and Evelyn Howard.",0
"It has been recently done; is it not so?” “Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in Dorcas is here.” “Eh bien, eh bien! Do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the eye.” “Yes, but this affair is more important.” “And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance?” I shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he chose to take that line. “You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and interview the brave Dorcas.” Dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her, and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap.",0
"There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are they often used, may I ask?” “Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call ‘a dress-up night.’ And very funny it is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he’s wonderful. Most comic! I shall never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he called it a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in his hand, and ‘Mind, Dorcas,’ he says, ‘you’ll have to be very respectful.",0
"“Those are the kind of sentiments that very soon go to the wall when the other sentiment comes along! Don’t they, old thing?” “I don’t know what you mean,” said Julius stiffly, but a large and burning blush overspread his countenance. “Shucks!” retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door, reopening it to add with dignity: “Morally, I shall always consider I have been jilted!” “What was it?” asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her. “Julius.” “What did he want?” “Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn’t going to let him.",0
"” This was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace’s dictation: Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any possible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to Agrasato’s curio-shop. Ask to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” The man will then ask you to “come into the back room.” Go with him. You will find a messenger who will bring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the diamonds with you.",0
"Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly.",0
"So strong was the illusion that she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form Supposing Mr. Brown Julius was there waiting Impossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the curtain aside and make sure Now they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to hide here, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided herself indignantly. She must not give way to this foolish fancying this curious insistent feeling that Mr.",0
"It was the genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer. The doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree, admired the talents so far removed from his own. On one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes.",0
"We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it.",0
"A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.",0
"” Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous in their methods. The thing worked. A powdered footman received the card and bore it away. Presently a pale secretary appeared. I fenced with him successfully. He retired defeated. He again reappeared and begged me to follow him. I did so. I entered a large room, a frightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant from the spirit-world. Then the door shut and I was face to face with Lord Nasby. A big man. Big head. Big face. Big moustache. Big stomach. I pulled myself together. I had not come here to comment on Lord Nasby’s stomach. He was already roaring at me.",0
"In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, mon ami, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go up to the Villa Geneviève.",0
"” And the Minister strode rapidly away. We chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre of the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little ferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old acquaintance of Poirot’s Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be one of the smartest of Scotland Yard’s officers. He came over and greeted my friend cheerfully. “I heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far they’ve got away with the goods all right. But I can’t believe they can keep him hidden long.",0
"Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she addressed to Julius. She went down the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had expected, the room was empty. She left the note on the table. A small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she returned to it. “Telegram for you, miss.” Tuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly. Then she gave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy! FROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy dragged his senses slowly back to life.",0
"Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the the body?” “Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure? It would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it. Still M. Bex, might I trouble you?” “Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.” “Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested Giraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s body.",0
"With a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked them energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration. He issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave of his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated, though I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that nothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face that he himself had little hope. Finally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that moment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs.",0
"But it is too late! Already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings. What can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl’s room, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs. Inglethorp’s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not arrived with the rest, but and this is significant I can find no one who saw her come from the other wing.” He looked at Mary Cavendish. “Am I right, madame?” She bowed her head.",0
"In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. “Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.” “Are you sure you’re all right now?” “Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.",0
"It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters was sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon. Having heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his appeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate which, of course, it did. “They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M.",0
"The masquerading on the part of the footman was to ensure a way of retreat in case of emergencies. And the footman "" ""Yes,"" I breathed. ""Number Four,"" said Poirot gravely. It was all very well for Poirot to say that we were acquiring information all the time and gaining an insight into our adversaries' minds I felt myself that I required some more tangible success than this.",0
"""Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish.",0
"""For the Lord’s sake, tell us, then!” Poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate, placed them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat effect, and then beamed affectionately on us both. “Come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the question which I asked myself. ‘If I were this man, where should I hide?’ Hastings, what do you say?” “Well,” I said, “I’m rather inclined to think I’d not do a bolt at all. I’d stay in London in the heart of things, travel by tubes and buses; ten to one I’d never be recognized.",0
"On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil! ve confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions.",0
"“There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble. There is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives have been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents which throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import them. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean ‘detonators,’ cauliflower, ‘rifles,’ other vegetables stand for various explosives.” “That’s very interesting,” I commended.",0
"Poirot. I just love jewellery. Ed knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me something new. You are interested in precious stones?” “I have had a good deal to do with them one time and another, madame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world.” He went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with bated breath. “There now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “If it isn’t just like a play! You know, I’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them.",0
"""And for wine, mademoiselle? What do you say to champagne?"" Miss Monro said nothing or everything. The meal started pleasantly. Poirot replenished the lady's glass with thoughtful assiduity, and gradually slid on to the topic nearest his heart. ""The poor Mr. Darrell. What a pity he is not with us."" ""Yes, indeed,"" sighed Miss Monro. ""Poor boy, I do wonder what's become of him."" ""It is a long time since you have seen him, yes?"" ""Oh, simply ages not since the war. He was a funny boy, Claudie, very close about things, never told you a word about himself.",0
"He always displayed a ridiculous distrust of my capacities. He would be convinced that I was running into danger without being equal to the situation, and would rush down to take command of the situation. But there was nothing to be done. I wrote as bidden. My captor took the note from me, read it, then nodded his head approvingly and handed it to one of the silent attendants who disappeared with it behind one of the silken hangings on the wall which masked a doorway. With a smile the man opposite to me picked up a cable form and wrote. He handed it to me. It read: ""Release the white bird with all despatch.",0
"“It looks like hair,” I remarked distastefully. “It is hair. I think it’s what they call a toupee.” “Indeed,” I commented. “Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in disguise?” “Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by her feet.” “Then that’s that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you about my private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have found me out.” At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be revealed! “Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,” I said kindly.",0
"He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred.",0
"""That was what I meant when I said it was all so complicated."" ""Let us go over all the main facts quietly and methodically. Recount them to me, Hastings, in an orderly and lucid fashion."" I started forthwith, endeavouring to be as orderly and lucid as I could. ""We start,"" I said, ""with Mr. Paynter. A man of fifty-five, rich, cultured, and somewhat of a globetrotter. For the last twelve years he has been little in England, but suddenly tiring of incessant travelling, he bought a small place in Worcestershire, near Market Handford, and prepared to settle down.",0
"""I shall be all right,” snapped Tuppence with her usual resentment of any kind of pity. “What about marriage?” inquired Julius. “Got any views on the subject?” “I intend to marry, of course,” replied Tuppence. “That is, if” she paused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then stuck to her guns bravely “I can find some one rich enough to make it worth my while. That’s frank, isn’t it? I dare say you despise me for it.” “I never despise business instinct,” said Julius. “What particular figure have you in mind?” “Figure?” asked Tuppence, puzzled. “Do you mean tall or short?” “No.",0
"To his intense annoyance he could distinguish little more; just a chance word here and there if a voice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity still farther. He eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by degrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing? He decided that with great care it could be done. Very slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved it round, holding his breath in his excessive care. A little more a little more still would it never be finished? Ah! at last it would turn no farther.",0
"I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out.",0
"At four-thirty, Mrs. Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills, makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness. At five o’clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable agitation, with a slip of paper ‘a letter,’ Dorcas thinks in her hand, and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted. Presumably, then, between four-thirty and five o’clock, something has occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now as anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was that something? “As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody entered or left that boudoir.",0
"“Get my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about my cousin.” “Your cousin?” “Sure thing. Jane Finn.” “Is she your cousin?” “My father and her mother were brother and sister,” explained Mr. Hersheimmer meticulously. “Oh!” cried Tuppence. “Then you know where she is?” “No!” Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table. “I’m darned if I do! Don’t you?” “We advertised to receive information, not to give it,” said Tuppence severely. “I guess I know that. I can read.",0
"” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.",0
"He is quite a stranger to me.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure.” “You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?” “No,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. “No, I do not think so. Of course they wore beards false ones the examining magistrate thought, but still no.” Now she seemed to make her mind up definitely. “I am sure neither of the two was this man.” “Very well, madame. That is all, then.” She stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads in her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify the man, in a completely natural manner. Giraud merely grunted.",0
"Madame, myself I do not of necessity accept the view of the police; with them is it always 'Cherchez la femme.' Yet it is clear that something occurred that night to alter your husband's plans. You say he asked for letters on returning to the hotel. Did he receive any?"" ""One only, and that must have been the one I wrote him on the day he left England."" Poirot remained sunk in thought for a full minute, then he rose briskly to his feet. ""Well, madame, the solution of the mystery lies in Paris, and to find it I myself journey to Paris on the instant."" ""It is all a long time ago, monsieur.",0
"She won’t speak without the cash anyway, you bet!” There was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and Tuppence felt a little comforted. “What you say is true,” said Sir James meditatively. “I must confess, however, that I cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute we did. Still, it cannot be helped, it is only a matter of waiting until the morning.” He looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer lay perfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head. “Well,” said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, “we must wait until the morning, that’s all.",0
"John Cavendish did not destroy that will.” Poirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police court proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was duly committed for trial. September found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington, Poirot being included in the family party. I myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see them continually. As the weeks went by, the state of Poirot’s nerves grew worse and worse. That “last link” he talked about was still lacking.",0
"Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell. He merely called to Marchaud: “You have got the other there?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Bring her in then.” “The other” was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with vehemence. “I object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to do with all this?” “Madame,” said Giraud brutally, “I am investigating not one murder, but two murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.” “How dare you?” she cried. “How dare you insult me by such a wild accusation! It is infamous.” “Infamous, is it? What about this?” Stooping, he again detached the hair, and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He advanced towards her.",0
"It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts. From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.",0
"She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs” “But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected. “I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!” “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity.",0
"“What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to Marguerite?” “Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.” “She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends spoke of her as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been in the habit of calling her by her full name. And, at the moment she was crying out to her, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or dying! Curious! There are one or two points that strike me as being obscure their sudden change of attitude towards yourself, for instance. By the way, the house was raided, of course?” “Yes, sir, but they’d all cleared out.",0
"There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat.",0
"The tone in which you said multi-millionaire was eloquent but let me impress upon you one fact this thing is being run by men at the top and Mr. Ryland has the reputation of being no beauty in his business dealings. An able, unscrupulous man, a man who has all the wealth that he needs, and is out for unlimited power."" There was undoubtedly something to be said for Poirot's view. I asked him when he had made up his mind definitely upon the point. ""That is just it. I am not sure. I cannot be sure. Mon ami, I would give anything to know. Let me but place Number Two definitely as Abe Ryland, and we draw nearer to our goal.",0
"The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans. No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” “More than unlikely impossible!” said Poirot quietly. “Eh?” The inspector stared. Poirot smiled modestly. “I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.",0
"""By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road, “I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.” Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me. “And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired. Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster.",0
"Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room.",0
"“Oh, get out! You don’t really care, damn you! You asked her to marry you in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I loved her. I’d have given the soul out of my body to save her from harm. I’d have stood by without a word and let her marry you, because you could have given her the sort of time she ought to have had, and I was only a poor devil without a penny to bless himself with. But it wouldn’t have been because I didn’t care!” “See here,” began Julius temperately. “Oh, go to the devil! I can’t stand your coming here and talking about ‘little Tuppence.’ Go and look after your cousin.",0
"My idea was to go at once to the Magnificent, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly. In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them. I gave way unwillingly.",0
"""Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.",0
"‘The secret! Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself.",0
".. she will suffer...."" I passed into the sitting-room without speaking. I took up the telegram and was about to pass out again when an idea struck me. Could I not leave some sign which would mean nothing to my enemies but which Poirot himself would find significant. I hurried across to the bookcase and tumbled out four books on to the floor. No fear of Poirot's not seeing them. They would outrage his eyes immediately and coming on top of his little lecture, surely he would find them unusual. Next I put a shovelful of coal on the fire and managed to spill four knobs into the grate.",0
"In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him.",0
"""Where did you eventually discover it?” “On the top of of a wardrobe.” “On top of the prisoner’s wardrobe?” “I I believe so.” “Did you not find it yourself?” “Yes.” “Then you must know where you found it?” “Yes, it was on the prisoner’s wardrobe.” “That is better.” An assistant from Parkson’s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on June 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as requested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed. No, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in their books.",0
"It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her.",0
"The man did nothing with it for some moments, then he suddenly began to write feverishly. With equal suddenness he stopped and let both paper and pencil fall to the ground. The doctor picked it up, and shook his head. ""Nothing here. Only the figure 4 scrawled a dozen times, each one bigger than the last. Wants to write 14 Farraway Street, I expect. It's an interesting case very interesting. Can you possibly keep him here until this afternoon? I'm due at the hospital now, but I'll come back this afternoon and make all arrangements about him. It's too interesting a case to be lost sight of.",0
"Vandemeyer’s bedroom. The pistol never left her forehead. The room was in a state of wild disorder, clothes were flung about right and left, a suit-case and a hat box, half-packed, stood in the middle of the floor. Tuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook a little, but she spoke out bravely. “Come now,” she said. “This is nonsense. You can’t shoot me. Why, every one in the building would hear the report.” “I’d risk that,” said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. “But, as long as you don’t sing out for help, you’re all right and I don’t think you will. You’re a clever girl.",0
"Watch the man-servant, Ivan. On no account let him slip through your fingers. Yes, yes, it is as I say."" He dashed down the receiver and turned to me. ""You see it not, Hastings? I will explain. Wilson was not poisoned, he was electrocuted. A thin metal rod passes up the middle of one of those chessmen. The table was prepared beforehand and set upon a certain spot on the floor. When the bishop was placed upon one of the silver squares, the current passed through Wilson's body, killing him instantly. The only mark was the electric burn upon his hand his left hand, because he was left-handed.",0
"There was no reply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang again and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no sign of life rewarded us. “This is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. He turned to the lift attendant. “Is there any pass-key to this door?” “There is one in the porter’s office downstairs.” “Get it, then, and, look here, I think you’d better send for the police.” Poirot approved with a nod of the head. The man returned shortly; with him came the manager. “Will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?” “Certainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying.",0
"But Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back with his kindly, shrewd glance. “Just a hint,” he said. “That’s all.” Tuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever. DRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her “afternoon out.” Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the stationer’s to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied on this point, she made her way to the Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr.",0
"Holding apart the frayed inner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing! No dummy this time! The real thing! “We’ve got it,” said Tuppence. “At last” The moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the faint creakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of them had eyes for anything but what Jane held in her hand. Sir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively. “Yes,” he said quietly, “this is the ill-fated draft treaty!” “We’ve succeeded,” said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost wondering unbelief in her voice.",0
"So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld.",0
"’” He went on to detail the events of the morning. “Lost her memory, eh?” said Tommy with interest. “By Jove, that explains why they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of questioning her. Bit of a slip on my part, that! But it wasn’t the sort of thing a fellow would be likely to guess.” “They didn’t give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?” Tommy shook his head regretfully. “Not a word. I’m a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have got more out of them somehow.” “I guess you’re lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was the goods all right.",0
"The prescription contained 1 gram of Potassium Bromide dissolved in 36 ml of water to make a mixture. After a few hours, the strychnine salt in the solution precipitated as an insoluble bromide in clear crystals. A tragic incident in England resulted in a lady losing her life after ingesting a similar concoction, with the precipitated strychnine settling at the bottom. Ultimately, she unknowingly consumed a lethal dose of the poison. It's important to note that Dr. Wilkins' prescription did not actually include any bromide, despite an empty box of bromide powders being mentioned.",1
"His countenance, devoid of any facial hair and remarkably expressive, bore a look of authority and strength that surpassed the usual. There was a magnetic quality about him that seemed to emanate effortlessly. Tuppence found herself torn between categorizing him as a thespian or a legal professional, yet her uncertainty dissipated when he introduced himself: Sir James Peel Edgerton. Her gaze upon him intensified with curiosity. This man before her was none other than the renowned barrister whose reputation spanned across England. Rumor had it that he was destined to become the future Prime Minister.",1
"In my investigation, I discovered extensive quarrying of stone and minerals in the area, seemingly operated by a small Italian company fronted by Abe Ryland. However, beneath the mountain lies a hidden underground complex, serving as the headquarters for the organization. This secret base allows the leaders to communicate with their vast network of followers worldwide. It is from this remote location in the Dolomites that the world's sinister dictators plan to make their grand entrance.",1
"""Hey Tommy!"" ""Hey Tuppence!"" The two friends greeted each other warmly, causing a brief obstruction at the Dover Street Tube exit. Despite the use of the word ""old,"" they were both quite young, their combined ages barely reaching forty-five. ""It feels like it's been forever since we last met,"" the young man remarked. ""Where are you headed? Care to grab a bite with me? We should probably move out of the way here."" With the girl agreeing, they began strolling down Dover Street in the direction of Piccadilly.",1
"I contacted the authorities immediately, reaching out to both Scotland Yard and the Admiralty. While the Admiralty was less than cooperative, Scotland Yard was polite and promised to investigate. A detective even came by this morning to collect her photo. I'll be heading to Paris tomorrow to check in with the Prefecture. By staying on top of them, I'm hopeful they'll start moving on this. Mr. Hersheimmer's determination was palpable, and they couldn't help but respect it.",1
"Dust was scattered about conspicuously, catching my sensitive friend's attention as he traced his finger along a rectangular mark on a nearby table. ""The service here is less than satisfactory,"" he remarked wryly. Lost in thought, he gazed out of the window, lost in contemplation. ""Well?"" I pressed, my impatience growing. ""Why did we even come here?"" His response was delayed. ""Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wanted to verify if the door was truly bolted on this side as well."" ""Well,"" I replied, glancing at the door leading to the previous room, ""it is indeed bolted."" Poirot simply nodded.",1
"""I do not threaten you with the gallows, but with the power of publicity. Your only chance is to be honest with me, Signor. I know you came to England to see Count Foscatini. You visited him on Tuesday morning and paid him a large sum of money for certain papers. The money was in Italian notes of small denomination. You left with the papers and never saw him again. When asked about the events of the evening, you claim someone must have impersonated you. But remember, the window-curtains were not drawn that evening, and it was still light outside at eight o'clock in June. Does that trigger any memories for you? Your story aligns with what I had suspected, Signor Ascanio. Good morning.""",1
"What was the significance of this seemingly harmless message? Was it related to a business transaction that Ryland was involved in, and was he concerned about keeping it confidential until completion? That was one potential interpretation. However, the number 4 imprinted on the envelopes stuck in my mind, leading me to believe that I was finally getting closer to our objective. I spent hours dissecting the contents of the letter, ruminating over it well into the following day until the answer dawned on me in a flash of clarity. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward solution. The key lay in the number 4.",1
"“Untrustworthy little scoundrel too!” he exclaimed angrily. “Let me tell you, Hastings, it’s causing quite a bit of trouble for us. And what about Evie, do you recall Evie?” “No.” “Ah, I suppose she was before your time. She’s the mater’s assistant, companion, and all-around helper! A real trooper that Evie! Not exactly youthful or stunning, but brave as they come.” “What were you going to mention?” “Ah, this man! He appeared out of thin air, claiming to be a distant cousin of Evie’s, although she didn’t appear too eager to admit the connection.”",1
"Pagett clearly wants me to do it. And I have to deal with Caroline. It's hard to believe that anyone would stay in England during winter! The weather here is just terrible. This situation is really frustrating. The house agents are saying it will be nearly impossible to rent out the Mill House now that it's been in the news. Caroline is satisfied with double the pay. We could have just sent her a message from Cannes. Honestly, there was no reason for us to come here in the first place. I'll be heading back tomorrow. The next day.",1
"Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair greeted me warmly, prompting me to approach them. The conversation revolved around Italy. “It’s deceptive,” Mrs. Blair argued. “Aqua calda should definitely mean cold water, not hot.” “You’re not a Latin expert,” Sir Eustace teased, grinning. “Men always act so superior when it comes to Latin,” Mrs. Blair remarked. “Yet, I can't help but notice that when asked to translate inscriptions in old churches, they often struggle! They stumble over words and find ways to avoid it.” “Absolutely,” agreed Colonel Race. “That's my tactic.” “Regardless, I have a soft spot for the Italians,” Mrs. Blair added.",1
"On the flip side, she made it clear that, while she wouldn't disclose any information, these tales were based on truth. To close confidantes, she divulged even more, discussing political plots, confidential documents, and hidden threats. Rumors circulated about the covert sale of Crown jewels, in which she played a crucial role. One of the Beroldys' social circle, a promising lawyer named Georges Conneau, quickly fell under the spell of the captivating Jeanne. Madame Beroldy subtly encouraged the infatuated young man, all the while professing her unwavering loyalty to her older husband.",1
"""As I opened the door to turn on the lights, a sudden darkness enveloped the room. Lady Yardly's scream pierced the air as the necklace was violently torn from her neck. In the chaos, we found the necklace abandoned near the side door, missing the Star of the East. A piece of silk from a Chinaman's robe caught in the door revealed the thief's identity. In a panic, the thief escaped into the night. The police were summoned, and Lady Yardly recounted the attack. Just as hope seemed lost, news arrived that Miss Marvell's diamond had also been stolen. My warnings had been ignored, and now the consequences were dire.""",1
"Enraged by what he perceived as mistreatment from his wife, driven by his intense love for her, a love he believed she reciprocated, he meticulously plotted the crime and delivered the fatal strike to liberate his beloved from a detestable marriage. It was only then that he discovered the existence of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and came to the realization that the woman he adored had deceived him! She didn't seek freedom for his sake, but rather to wed the affluent American. Feeling used and consumed by jealousy, he publicly accused her, claiming that he had only acted upon her wishes. In a surprising turn of events, Madame Beroldy displayed her undeniable brilliance.",1
"“Let’s play a little game,” Poirot suggested, fixing Black with a curious stare. “I will say a word, and you respond with the first word that comes to mind. Shall we start?” Black hesitated, but eventually agreed to participate. Poirot instructed Hastings to write down the words as they went along. With his watch set on the table, Poirot began. “Day.” Without much delay, Black replied, “Night.” The game continued with Poirot saying, “Name,” and Black responding with “Place.” As the words flowed, Poirot’s deductions sharpened. “Thank you, Captain Black. Can we speak in thirty minutes?” Black agreed, leaving Poirot to decipher the hidden meanings behind the words.",1
"I found a small brown leather pocket-book that had fallen from our visitor during our struggle. Inside were two receipted bills in the name of M. Felix Laon, along with a folded-up piece of paper. This paper, a half sheet of note-paper, contained a few crucial words written in pencil. ""The next council meeting will be on Friday at 34 Rue des Echelles at 11 a.m.,"" it read, signed with a large number 4. Today was indeed Friday, and the clock on the mantelpiece indicated it was 10:30. ""What an opportunity!"" I exclaimed.",1
"""But who could have done it? And why? How did they manage to get in if the door was locked?"" These questions tumbled out of us in a jumble. Poirot responded methodically and with precision. ""The culprit remains a mystery. The motive eludes me. The time frame? Just an hour ago. And as for the locked door, a simple lock easily bypassed. Any key in this hallway could have been used."" We exchanged bewildered glances. Poirot moved towards the fireplace, his demeanor composed, yet his trembling hands betraying his true emotions as he absentmindedly adjusted the vases. ""Let me explain,"" he began after a moment.",1
"""Numerous stories, both accurate and fabricated, circulated regarding the infamous gem rumored to be insured for an astonishing fifty thousand pounds. As I approached Poirot to welcome our elegant client, Miss Marvell, a flood of information about the stone rushed through my mind. She was petite, delicate, and possessed a youthful appearance, characterized by her innocent, azure eyes. Poirot kindly offered her a seat, prompting her to immediately divulge her concerns. ""You may perceive me as naive, Monsieur Poirot,"" she began, ""but after Lord Cronshaw recounted your remarkable resolution of his nephew's mysterious demise, I knew I had to seek your guidance.""",1
"“When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” Detective Brown asked.“It all clicked into place when I started working methodically,” replied the suspect. “The shooting incident just didn't add up, but once I learned that the Prime Minister had traveled to France with a bandaged face, everything fell into place. Then, after checking all the local hospitals between Windsor and London, and finding no one matching the description of the suspect, I knew I was on the right track. It was simple deduction from there on out.”The next day, Poirot presented me with a telegram that had just arrived.",1
"""Because,” he exclaimed, “it is vital that I am there to witness its impact on me, just as it did on you.” “What?” I inquired. “Yes, to ensure my attendance! Upon reviewing the letter, he felt dissatisfied. It lacked the necessary force!” Pausing briefly, he continued with a glint in his eyes: “Hence, my friend, given that the postscript was not an impulsive addition, but a deliberate one, time is of the essence, and we must locate him without delay.” “Merlinville,” I pondered aloud. “The name sounds familiar.” Poirot simply nodded.",1
"""What is that?” “Jack Renauld was likely familiar with the layout of the golf course. He anticipated the body being found quickly once they began to dig the bunker.” Giraud burst into laughter. “But that's absurd! He wanted the body to be discovered! Until then, death couldn't be assumed, preventing him from inheriting.” A flash of green appeared in Poirot's eyes as he stood up. “So why bury it?” he inquired softly. “Think about it, Giraud.",1
"""By chance, I saw the entries in his pass-book when verifying a small item for Poirot. A huge sum was paid to a Russian with every letter of the alphabet in his name. Poirot kept repeating, 'It is the greatest mistake to underestimate your adversary. Remember that, mon ami.' This was the pitfall he sought to avoid.""",1
"There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! ""My God, Poirot!"" I cried. ""Look at her hand, her right hand. It's all red!"" Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. ""Blood,"" she cried hysterically. ""Yes, it's blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he's come back!"" Her voice died away in a gurgle. ""Lights,"" said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic.",1
"His ""hustling"" activities extended beyond London, and his sudden arrivals and departures were embraced by the Young Adventurers as routine. There was a possibility that Julius P. Hersheimmer had departed for Constantinople spontaneously, believing a lead to his cousin's vanishing could be discovered there.",1
"The local investigators have scoured the area for any clues. Every possible effort is being made, yet Anne Beddingfeld remains missing. The prevailing belief is that she wandered in a sleep-like state. Traces along the trail by the bridge suggest a deliberate step off the cliff. If true, her fate would have been a tragic fall onto the jagged rocks beneath. Regrettably, the majority of the tracks were erased by a group of sightseers who passed through that morning. This explanation leaves much to be desired.",1
"""Indeed, he did not object to me joining Sir Eustace on the boat. He was not ready to be caught just yet. It appeared that Nadina did not bring the jewels to the rendezvous as planned, and Carton might be the one concealing them on the Kilmorden Castle. They were hoping I had a clue to their location. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not retrieve the diamonds, he remained in danger and was desperate to get them back. Where Carton hid them, if he did, remained a mystery to me.""",1
"Miss Howard abruptly entered the room and discreetly handed Poirot an aged sheet of brown paper, whispering ""On top of the wardrobe"" before swiftly exiting, leaving him to ponder the mysterious message. My attention was momentarily diverted from the case, recalling the overlooked clues that hinted at a deeper truth.",1
"""When Grant is away from home, Betsy is socializing in the village as usual. Meanwhile, the culprit arrives wearing identical boots, strikes the old man in the living room, and proceeds to slit his throat before changing into a different pair of boots. Cunningly, he exits in a butcher's cart, evading detection despite being in plain sight."" Ingles met Poirot's gaze, puzzled. ""But how did no one witness his actions?"" Poirot explained, ""The brilliance of Number Four lies in being seen and unseen at the same time. The disguise of a butcher's cart ensured that he remained unnoticed by all observers.""",1
"""I informed him that I held a great liking for him, with hopes of it growing stronger, yet I made it clear that I did not harbor any romantic feelings towards him. He assured me that he was content with that, and thus we were joined in matrimony."" She remained silent for a moment, a slight crease forming on her brow as she appeared to reflect on the days gone by. ""I believe he did have feelings for me initially. However, it became evident that we were not compatible. Almost immediately, we grew distant. It pains me to admit, but the reality is that he grew weary of me quite swiftly.""",1
"""And why does it all matter?"" scoffed Giraud. ""Because when you see two crimes with identical design and execution, you know the same mastermind is at work. I am on the hunt for that mastermind, Mr. Giraud, and I will uncover it. This is a genuine clue, a psychological clue. You may be an expert on cigarettes and match ends, Mr. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, understand the human psyche!"" The eccentric little man tapped his forehead for emphasis. Giraud remained unmoved. ""In addition,"" Poirot added, ""I will share one crucial detail with you that may have escaped your attention.",1
"""The nature of crimes remains constant,"" Poirot observed calmly. Giraud's demeanor indicated his readiness to oppose. He did not want to share any connection with the other man, and it seemed likely that he would withhold any crucial information he discovered. ""The investigating official,"" Bex started to say. But Giraud cut him off bluntly: ""Who cares about the investigating official! The crucial factor is the light. It will disappear within the next thirty minutes. I am well-informed about the situation, and the residents of the residence will manage fine until the next day, but if we hope to uncover the perpetrators, this is where we must search.""",1
"In my last correspondence with the Argentine, there was no mention of my upcoming journey. It was a spontaneous decision made due to some business entanglements. I could almost visualize the surprise and curiosity on his face when he sees me. I was aware that he wouldn't stray too far from his usual whereabouts. The days of traveling across England for cases were behind him. His reputation had grown, and he now juggled multiple cases at once, refusing to be consumed by just one.",1
"""In fact, I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have something to fall back on.” “Don’t tell me you hoard stamps!” “No, I live with a fascinating man. He’s a former detective from Belgium. He’s running a successful private investigation agency in London. He’s truly a remarkable individual. Time and time again, he has succeeded where the official authorities have not.” My friend listened intently. “That’s quite intriguing, isn’t it? I have a passion for crime. I watch all the mystery movies and eagerly follow murder cases in the news.” “Do you recall the Styles Case?” I inquired.",1
"He was a young man with a determined look in his eyes. We locked gazes, and he didn't back down. ""Okay,"" I muttered weakly. ""Just keep quiet about me coming along."" I hesitated, feeling a sense of foreboding about the situation. It seemed like a good idea to have him by my side, but I couldn't shake the feeling that trouble was on the horizon. Just when I thought things were finally settling down! As he turned to leave, I called out to stop him.",1
"""I can never shake off the guilt of his death. It will be a burden I carry forever!"" ""No, no,"" I reassured. ""It's chilling to think that Bella was the one who took my father's life,"" Jack continued, ""but I had wronged her. When I crossed paths with Marthe, and saw my error, I should have reached out and admitted my fault. Yet, the fear of confrontation, and the worry of Marthe misconstruing the situation, held me back. I lacked courage and simply hoped the issue would resolve on its own.""",1
"In the cases I have documented, Poirot's inquiries typically begin with a key fact, whether it be murder or theft, and advance from there through a series of logical deductions to the ultimate successful resolution. However, the incidents I am going to recount next were set in motion by a peculiar sequence of events that unfolded from seemingly insignificant occurrences that initially caught Poirot's eye to the dark events that concluded a highly unusual case.",1
"""That's not Hercule Poirot!"" Number Four exclaimed, shocked. The countess reached out and grabbed Poirot's mustache, which came off in her hand. It was then clear that the man's face was different, with a small scar on his upper lip altering his appearance. ""He's not Hercule Poirot,"" Number Four muttered in disbelief. ""Then who is he?"" I suddenly exclaimed, but stopped abruptly, worried that I had given everything away. However, the man I continued to call Poirot looked at me reassuringly.",1
"""Indeed, but by whom?"" ""Why, the all-knowing Mr. Brown, naturally!"" A hint of mockery tinged the American's words, causing Sir James to raise his gaze. ""Do you truly have faith in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?"" ""No, I do not,"" asserted the young American firmly. ""Not truly, at least. I see him as merely a puppet, a fabricated name to instill fear in the naive. The true mastermind behind this operation is the Russian fellow Kramenin. I suspect he could orchestrate uprisings in multiple nations simultaneously if he so desired! As for the English sector, I believe the man Whittington leads the way."" ""I must disagree,"" Sir James retorted curtly.",1
"“As Hastings indicates, bodies tend to be discovered persistently.” “Moreover, a gardener mentioned spotting a silhouette heading towards the rose-garden from the side of the residence. The study's lengthy French window overlooks the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently used that entrance. However, the gardener was far away tending to cucumber frames, unable to confirm if it was his employer's figure. Additionally, the time is uncertain, but it was likely before six since the gardeners finish their work by then.” “Could it have been Mr.",1
"As we drove around in the afternoon, a flat tire caused a delay. By the time I returned to the Grand Metropolitan, it was already past 8 o'clock. The first thing I saw was Poirot, looking even smaller than usual, standing between the Opalsens with a look of contentment. ""My dear Hastings!"" he exclaimed, rushing over to greet me. ""Give me a hug, my friend; everything has gone perfectly!"" Fortunately, the hug was only a gesture, something one can never be certain of with Poirot. ""Are you saying"" I started. ""Absolutely marvelous, I must say!"" Mrs. Opalsen chimed in, her chubby face beaming. ""I told you, Ed, that if anyone could recover my pearls, it would be him."" ""You certainly did, my love, you certainly did.""",1
"Poirot was engrossed in reading his letters when suddenly his attention shifted. A letter from a mysterious Mr. Renauld in France, urgently requesting his detective services, caught his eye. Poirot's interest was piqued, and he wasted no time in deciding to embark on this new adventure. The urgency of the situation was clear, and they needed to act swiftly. The mention of Santiago and South America added a layer of intrigue to the case. The clock was ticking, and there was no time to waste. A sense of excitement filled the air as Poirot and his companion prepared to embark on their journey to France.",1
"""I accuse you of fabricating a false alibi by creating a fictitious appointment and forging a note to support your claim!"" ""No."" ""Were you not actually at the chemist's shop in Styles St. Mary, buying strychnine under the name of Alfred Inglethorp, while you said you were waiting at a remote location?"" ""No, that's a falsehood."" ""Did you not dress in Mr. Inglethorp's clothing, don a fake black beard resembling his, and sign the register in his name?"" ""That's completely false.""",1
"""I chose to hire Harry as my secretary instead of turning him in to the authorities,"" she explained. ""I was after those accursed diamonds. Nadina, that sneaky little vixen, was pitting your Harry against me. If I didn't meet her demands, she threatened to sell the gems back to him. It was a miscalculation on my part. I assumed she would have them on her that day, but she was more cunning than I anticipated. To make matters worse, her husband Carton was also deceased, leaving me clueless as to the whereabouts of the diamonds.""",1
"I never expected to find myself in such a situation. As a crime novelist, I had always imagined myself writing about thrilling events, not actually experiencing them. But here I was, faced with a wounded man in my cabin on the Kilmorden Castle. The night had taken a turn I had never anticipated. It all started with a number - 17. Little did I know that this seemingly innocuous number would lead me down a path of danger and intrigue. The man before me, wounded and defiant, was a puzzle waiting to be solved. And I, with my histrionic talents and quick thinking, was determined to unravel the mystery that lay before me. It was a night I would never forget, a night that would forever change the course of my life.",1
"""What happens to your beliefs now?"" ""They won't be swayed by the mistake of twelve fools! But that won't happen. Firstly, a rural jury is reluctant to bear the burden, and Mr. Inglethorp is practically the local squire. Moreover,"" he added calmly, ""I wouldn't permit it!"" ""You wouldn't allow it?"" ""No."" I observed the peculiar little man, torn between irritation and entertainment. He exuded an overwhelming self-assurance. As if sensing my inner monologue, he nodded gently. ""Indeed, my friend, I would follow through with my words.""",1
"""I suggest you retire for the evening,"" she said icily. ""It would be in your best interest."" ""I will manage in the kitchen, ma'am. Cook will "" ""Cook is not available,"" Mrs. Vandemeyer interrupted sharply. ""I have sent her away. It would be wise for you to retire now."" Suddenly, Tuppence felt a surge of fear. There was a harshness in Mrs. Vandemeyer's tone that unsettled her deeply. Moreover, the other woman was gradually pushing her up the hallway. Tuppence stood her ground. ""I do not wish to "" Then, in an instant, a cold blade pressed against her temple, and Mrs. Vand.",1
"“No, my dear friend. I have my own thoughts regarding that will. But I can assure you, it did not favor Miss Howard in the least.” I believed him, despite my skepticism. “Very well,” I conceded, “let us absolve Miss Howard then. I must admit, it was your comments that initially led me to doubt her. Your remarks during the inquest sparked my suspicions.” Poirot appeared confused. “What exactly did I say during the inquest?” “Do you not recall? When I mentioned Miss Howard and John Cavendish as individuals beyond reproach?” “Ah yes, I remember now.”",1
"""The mutton leg?"" ""Yes, Hastings, the mutton leg. Despite assurances that no one visited Granite Bungalow that morning, I discovered a frozen leg of mutton in the larder. Given that it was Monday, the meat must have been delivered that very morning; had it arrived on Saturday, it would not have remained frozen in the hot weather. Clearly, someone had been to the Bungalow, a man who would not raise suspicion with a trace of blood here and there."" ""Ingenious!"" exclaimed Ingles. ""Indeed, quite clever, Number Four."" ""As clever as Hercule Poirot?"" I pondered.",1
"He sported a gentle brown beard, paired with an unusual flowing tie. Responding to Poirot's inquiries without hesitation, he recounted his evening with the Wycherlys. ""I returned home around eleven, using my latch-key since all the servants were asleep. I assumed my uncle had retired for the night as well. Although, I could have sworn I glimpsed that silent Chinese beggar Ah Ling skulking around the hall, but I must have been mistaken."" ""When was the last time you saw your uncle, Mr. Paynter? Before moving in with him, that is."" ""Not since I was a young child of ten. He and my father, his brother, had a falling out, you see.""",1
"“I was considering offering a significant reward for any information about Jane a few days ago, but Scotland Yard advised against it,” I explained. “They believed it was not the best course of action.” “That was probably for the best,” Sir James commented. “But regarding Julius,” Tuppence interjected, “he’s being truthful. He’s incredibly wealthy.” “The old man amassed a fortune,” Julius added. “Now, let’s focus. What’s your plan?” After a brief pause, Sir James spoke up. “Time is of the essence. We need to act quickly.” Turning to Tuppence, he asked, “Have you spoken to Mrs. Smith?”",1
"Public opinion would shift to the side of the Labour extremists and revolutionists if the fatal document ended up in Mr. Brown's hands. The Government, backed by a loyal army and police force, might win the battle but not without causing significant suffering. Tommy believed he had a fairly accurate understanding of the situation, thanks to Mr. Carter's insights. There were subtle, insistent forces at work, stirring up memories of old grievances and pushing for more drastic measures than meeting the Government halfway. The looming threat of a general strike and its associated hardships made many apprehensive.",1
"”The room was a kaleidoscope of colors - golds, reds, and browns blending together. All eyes were fixed on the girl, her porcelain white throat and cascading bronze hair capturing everyone's attention. As the supper party commenced, Tommy found himself at the center of attention, his secrecy unraveling with accusations from Julius. The Argentine trip, the mysterious Tuppence - it all came to light, leaving Julius feeling cast aside.""",1
"He's like the rest of them, spouting inflammatory speeches for political gain only to backtrack later. I encountered him as he was heading to Cape Town to defend himself in a lengthy Dutch speech. The endless droning in the South African Legislative Assembly made me grateful for the brevity of the House of Commons. But trouble was brewing, with arms and explosives flowing in under the guise of vegetables. The mastermind behind it all was rumored to be in Johannesburg. Despite warnings and offers of safe passage, I refused to be whisked away to Pretoria. Instead, I received a surprising telegram confirming Anne's safety in Kimberley. Her resilience never ceases to amaze me.",1
"Harry Rayburn sat quietly between the rough wooden walls of the small room, his presence casting a shadow over the scene. Anne, still weak and bruised, looked up at him with tears streaming down her face. She longed to hold on to this moment, to die with his hand in hers. Rayburn's eyes held a new tenderness as he offered her a cup of milk, speaking softly and reassuringly. Despite the pain and confusion, Anne found solace in his presence, feeling safe and protected for the first time since the nightmare began. She clung to him, desperate for his comfort and the hope he brought with him. Rayburn stayed by her side, a silent guardian in the darkness of the room, promising to keep her safe from harm.",1
"""I watched as she prepared for a long night ahead. Taking a seat, I expressed my confusion at her distress. ""My dream - that dinner we had,"" she exclaimed. I raised an eyebrow at her reaction to the curry. ""Oh, Sir Eustace!"" she cried, clearly upset. But we both knew that nightmares often follow a heavy meal. Trying to calm her, I suggested that Anne Beddingfeld and Race were simply taking a late-night walk without causing a commotion. ""Do you really believe they're just out for a stroll at this hour?"" she questioned. ""People do foolish things when they're young,"" I replied, defending their actions. ""Although Race should certainly know better.""",1
"""I had no idea that cannibalism was considered a sacred topic,"" I shot back, feeling a twinge of irritation. But as I spoke, a new thought occurred to me. Considering Mr. Chichester's supposed two-year stay in the heart of Africa, why did he not appear more tanned? His complexion was as fair as that of a newborn baby. Something didn't quite add up. Despite his flawless demeanor, there was an air of artificiality about him. Could he be compared to a theatrical clergyman, I wondered, recalling the young curates from my days in Little Hampsly.",1
"I was shocked to discover that she truly cared for me. I had assumed I was merely a passing fancy, yet she embraced me warmly and wept upon our reunion. After composing ourselves, I sat beside her and recounted the entire saga in detail. ""You always harbored suspicions about Colonel Race,"" she mused once my tale concluded. ""I never doubted him until the night of your disappearance. I held him in high regard and envisioned him as a suitable match for you. Please don't be offended, my dear Anne, but how can you be certain of the veracity of this young man's words? You seem to place unwavering trust in him."" ""I have complete faith in him,"" I protested adamantly.",1
"I turned to look at him, but his expression was unreadable. His eyes were fixed on something behind me, causing a shiver to run down my spine. I slowly turned around, but all I saw was the familiar sight of the living room. The only movement came from the dying fire in the hearth and the clock ticking on the wall. Mrs. Inglethorp's breathing was starting to steady, and she weakly muttered, ""I shouldn't have locked the door."" Suddenly, a figure blocked the light from the doorway. It was Mary Cavendish, her comforting presence enveloping Cynthia, who appeared disoriented and fragile in her arms.",1
"""They reached the platform just as the train halted. Tuppence unlocked the door of an unoccupied first-class compartment, and the two women collapsed onto the cushioned seats, gasping for air. A man glanced inside, then moved along to the next carriage. Jane jumped in alarm, her eyes wide with fear. She turned to Tuppence, searching for answers. “Could he be one of them?” she whispered. Tuppence reassured her. “No, don’t worry.” She grasped Jane’s hand tightly. “Tommy wouldn’t have instructed us to do this if he wasn’t certain we’d be safe.” “But he doesn’t understand them like I do!” Jane trembled. “You can't possibly comprehend.""",1

She gazed up at him with uncertainty. “Yes, yes, my child, I assure you it is wiser not to fight back.” Then he faced the inspector. “May I, sir? A small test for my personal curiosity.” “Depends on the nature of it,” the police officer responded vaguely. Poirot turned back to Célestine. “You mentioned going into your room to get a spool of thread. Where exactly was it?” “On the dresser, sir.” “And the scissors?” “There as well.""",1
"At the end of the day, while the death duties are a concern, a significant portion of my father's wealth is tied to the estate, and Lawrence will remain with us for the time being, so his portion will also be available. Initially, we may face some financial constraints, as I mentioned before, I am also in a tight spot financially. Nevertheless, the creditors are no longer pressing for immediate payment."" As the news of Inglethorp's imminent departure sank in, we enjoyed the most pleasant breakfast since the unfortunate incident occurred.",1
"""And their offspring behaved much like children do today, amusing themselves with handfuls of pebbles, stacking them and then toppling them over. The more skillfully they stacked the stones, the more delighted they were. If I were to label this area, I would dub it ‘The Land of Oversized Children.’"" ""You may be closer to the truth than you realize,"" Colonel Race remarked solemnly. ""Uncomplicated, basic, vast that is Africa."" I nodded in agreement. ""You have a fondness for it, don't you?"" I inquired. ""Indeed. However, residing in it for an extended period well, it instills a sense of what you might consider ruthlessness.""",1
"I never met her, as she passed away when I was just a child. The circumstances of her death were tragic - she mistakenly overdosed on a sleeping potion. Despite the sorrow, my father's heart was shattered. Following her death, he joined the Consular Service, taking me along wherever he was assigned. By the time I turned twenty-three, I had traveled far and wide. It was an exhilarating existence, one that I cherished deeply."" A nostalgic smile graced her lips as she reminisced about the past. ""But then my father passed away, leaving me in a dire financial situation. I had no choice but to move in with elderly relatives in Yorkshire."" She visibly recoiled at the memory.",1
"""Notoriety is a powerful tool for diverting suspicion. Sooner rather than later, you will come to understand this truth.""   ""In the meantime, you are constantly seen in the company of Peel Edgerton. Not only is he one of England's most renowned K.C.s, but his passion lies in criminology! It's a risky game!""   ""I am aware that his persuasive skills have spared countless men from the noose,"" Mrs. Vandemeyer remarked calmly. ""But what of it? I may find myself in need of his expertise one day. In that case, having such a powerful ally in court could prove to be very advantageous.""   Boris rose from his seat and started pacing back and forth, clearly agitated.",1
"""They decided to adopt a common name,"" he explained. ""Elsa Hardt and her companion from New York rented a flat under the alias Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. When they realized they were being pursued by a dangerous secret society, they devised a cunning plan. Knowing that their enemies were unfamiliar with their appearance, they advertised the flat at an unusually low price. With countless Robinsons searching for accommodation in London, they were confident their pursuers would be led astray.""",1
"As I strained to hear young Renauld's response, my attention was suddenly captured by an unexpected sight a short distance away from the hedge. There was what appeared to be a brown bush, a peculiar sight indeed for this time of year. Intrigued, I approached for a closer look, only to have the brown bush swiftly retreat and signal for me to remain silent. It was Giraud. Gesturing for caution, he guided me around the shed until we were safely out of earshot. ""What were you up to over there?"" I inquired. ""The same thing you were doing - eavesdropping,"" Giraud replied. ""But I stumbled upon it accidentally!"" ""Ah,"" was all Giraud said in response.",1
"""But imagine our shock when, out of the blue, she revealed their engagement just three months ago! Alfred is easily two decades her junior! It's shameless gold-digging if you ask me, but she's in charge of her own fate and she's tied the knot."" ""I can only imagine the strain it must put on everyone involved."" ""Strain? It's downright despicable!"" And so, three days later, I arrived at Styles St. Mary, a quaint station seemingly out of place in the serene countryside, surrounded by lush fields and winding roads.",1
"""Did anyone else see him after that?"" ""Only the night porter,"" replied Number Four. ""He claimed he had never seen Halliday before. A man who resembled Halliday arrived, requested letters, went up to his room, packed a small suitcase, and left the following morning. Halliday was not spotted by anyone that evening because he was already captured by his adversaries. Was the person Madame Olivier met truly Halliday? Indeed, despite not recognizing him, she was well-versed in her area of expertise and could easily detect an imposter.""",1
"""Hautet, removing his hat, “we deeply apologize for the intrusion, but you understand the requirements of the Law? Please convey my regards to Madame your mother, and would she kindly spare me a brief moment for a conversation.” The girl hesitated briefly, her left hand clutching her side to calm the overwhelming turmoil in her heart. Eventually, she regained composure and whispered, “I'll check. Please, follow me.” Leading him into a room on the left side of the hallway, we could hear the faint murmur of their conversation.""",1
"One of the initial steps I took was to contact the hospital where she worked.” “And then?” “I discovered that Miss Howard had covered the afternoon shift on Tuesday, and due to an unexpected convoy arriving, she volunteered to work the night shift, a gesture that was appreciated. Case closed.” “Interesting,” I remarked, feeling slightly puzzled. “In truth,” I added, “it was her intense animosity towards Inglethorp that caught my attention. I have a suspicion that she would go to great lengths to harm him. I also suspected she may have knowledge regarding the destruction of the will.",1
"""The revelation of the possible love affair between Madame Daubreuil and Mr. Renauld left Mrs. Renauld in a state of anguish. Stonor, shocked by this revelation, stood there with a blank expression on his face. The door suddenly burst open, and a young man, with a striking resemblance to the deceased Mr. Renauld, entered the room. The uncanny resemblance caused a stir among the assembled group, but it soon became apparent that this was a mere boy, untouched by the grey hairs of age, who had entered with an impetuousness that disregarded all norms of decorum.""",1
"""I'm sorry, but I am far from convinced that Jack Renauld is guilty,"" Poirot stated firmly. Giraud couldn't help but laugh, shaking his head in disbelief. Poirot's eyes flashed dangerously. ""Your disrespectful attitude towards me throughout this investigation will not go unpunished. I propose a wager - 500 francs says that I will identify M. Renauld's killer before you. Do we have a deal?"" Giraud was speechless, muttering under his breath once more. ""Let's settle this once and for all,"" Poirot insisted. ""Do we have a deal?"" Giraud hesitated, clearly taken aback.",1
"There was no hint as to the identity of the thief who had stolen the million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds from the London and Scottish Bank on board the Olympia. Miss Esmée Farquhar, engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway, sought the help of Hercule Poirot to unravel the mystery. Ridgeway, visibly distressed, recounted the events leading up to the theft. The bonds, sealed in his presence by the joint general managers of the bank, vanished from his locked portmanteau on the voyage to New York. Poirot, intrigued by the case, agreed to assist and suggested lunch at the 'Cheshire Cheese' to discuss the matter further. The young couple, along with Captain Hastings, joined Poirot for lunch, eager to uncover the truth behind the disappearance.",1
"""I specifically chose No. 17, and the purser told me I could have it."" ""I apologize,"" I stated icily. ""But No. 17 has already been assigned to me."" ""I cannot accept that."" The steward interjected. ""The other cabin is just as good, if not better."" ""I insist on having No. 17."" ""What is going on here?"" a new voice demanded. ""Steward, move my belongings here. This is my cabin."" It was the man I had lunch with, Rev. Edward Chichester. ""I apologize,"" I replied. ""It is assigned to Sir Eustace Pedler,"" Mr. Pagett explained. Tensions were rising. ""I regret having to disagree,"" Chichester said with a meek smile that failed to conceal his determination to have his way. Meek men are always stubborn, in my experience.",1
"I rose cautiously, scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. With delicate fingers, I removed a portrait of Marguerite holding a casket of jewels from the wall. Silently, I retrieved a magazine and a couple of mysterious envelopes from my coat. After moistening the brown paper on the back of the portrait, I carefully peeled it off. Concealed within were the separated pages from the magazine, along with a valuable hidden inside. With the help of some adhesive from the envelopes, I reattached the brown paper, ensuring no one would suspect a thing.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, everyone fast asleep. Poirot and I stood beneath Mrs. Renauld's open window, waiting. Suddenly, a cry for help echoed through the night, a light flickered in an upper room. Poirot sprang into action, climbing up a tree and through the window. I followed, marveling at Dulcie's acrobatic skills. Inside, Mrs. Renauld was safe, but Marthe Daubreuil lay dead on the floor. Poirot's deduction of the events that transpired that night left me speechless. The murderer had been unmasked, thanks to a clever ruse and a stolen dagger. The night's events were stranger than any dream.",1
"""The typewritten words flickered on the screen. Details of a green hat, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket monogrammed P.L.C. Tommy turned to Mr. Carter with a desperate look. Mr. Carter confirmed, ""Found on the Yorkshire coast near Ebury. Looks like foul play."" Tommy gasped in shock, ""Tuppence! Those fiends! I'll make them pay! I'll track them down!"" But the sympathy in Mr. Carter's expression gave him pause. ""I understand your anger, but it's futile. You'll only exhaust yourself in vain pursuit.""",1
"We drove past the town and reached a fork in the road. A peasant directed us to the Villa Geneviève, but as we looked for it, a girl caught our attention. She was a vision of beauty, with a golden head and anxious eyes. Poirot and I were intrigued by her presence. Suddenly, we were stopped by a sergent de ville who delivered the shocking news of Mr. Renauld's murder. Poirot sprang into action, seeking answers from the authorities. The commissary welcomed us and Poirot revealed that the victim had foreseen his own demise. As we entered the Villa, the examining magistrate was ready to begin his investigations. The crime had occurred in the early hours of the morning, and the mystery was waiting to be unraveled.",1
"In the dim light, there was little to distinguish him, a man who could easily blend into the background. He greeted the dancer with a bow that bordered on theatrical. ""Madame, it is truly a pleasure."" Jeanne caught those words before she made her exit, leaving them alone. As the door closed, Nadina's smile shifted subtly. ""Despite our shared background, let us refrain from speaking Russian,"" she suggested. ""Neither of us are fluent in the language, after all,"" her companion concurred.",1
"The Grand Duke of Russia, court intrigues, and political plots all pointed back to the mysterious woman herself! She was the mastermind behind the clever deceptions, manipulating others to part with their money under false pretenses of possessing the legendary ""Crown jewels,"" which turned out to be nothing more than worthless imitations. Her entire life story was exposed without mercy. The reason behind the murder was connected to a man named Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Despite his efforts to evade the truth, Mr. Trapp eventually confessed that he harbored feelings for the woman and would have proposed marriage if she were available.",1
"She was in her middle years, with hair that was once dark but now mostly silvered. Despite her age, her strong personality exuded vitality. It was clear she was a force to be reckoned with, a true ""maitresse femme."" With a dignified nod, she welcomed us. ""Please, take a seat, gentlemen."" As we sat down, the magistrate's clerk positioned himself at a nearby table. M. Hautet spoke up, ""Madame, I hope you can recount for us the events of last night without causing you undue distress?"" She replied, ""Of course not, monsieur. Time is of the essence in capturing and punishing these vile murderers.""",1
"""Do you think you'd be able to identify Chichester if he were in a different disguise?"" Suzanne inquired. I shook my head, admitting, ""I didn't even recognize him as the stewardess, and wouldn't have without your sketch."" ""He must be a professional actor,"" Suzanne mused. ""His make-up is truly remarkable. He could walk off the boat looking like a laborer, and no one would suspect a thing."" ""You're not exactly reassuring,"" I remarked. Just then, Colonel Race entered through the window and joined us. ""Where is Sir Eustace?"" Suzanne inquired. ""I haven't seen him today.""",1
"Hautet pondered. “It seems somewhat unjust to leave the son at the mercy of his mother, should she remarry and her new husband gain control. The boy may never see a cent of his father’s wealth.” Poirot simply raised an eyebrow. “Humans are prideful creatures. Perhaps M. Renauld assumed his widow would remain single. And entrusting the money to his son's mother could have been a calculated move. Wealthy heirs are often known to be reckless.” “Your theory could hold true. Now, M.",1
"“Did you hit him?” asked Tuppence anxiously. “Yes,” replied Julius. “But he’s still breathing. Tough guy to put down. Are you okay, Tuppence?” “I’m fine. Where’s Tommy? And who is this?” She pointed at the trembling Kramenin. “Tommy’s headed for Argentina. Probably thought you were done for. Slow down at the gate, George! Good. We have a few minutes before they catch on. They'll call for reinforcements, so watch out for traps and avoid the obvious route. Who's this, Tuppence? Meet Monsieur Kramenin. I convinced him to join us for his own good.”",1
"""I couldn't believe my eyes,"" I said, shaking my head in disbelief. Pagett triumphantly held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap. ""What on earth would a woman be doing with these?"" I thought to myself, silently chuckling at Pagett's ignorance. Despite his insistence, I couldn't agree that these items were definitive proof of Miss Pettigrew's gender. Pagett's outdated views never ceased to amaze me. I half expected him to pull out a cigarette case next to further support his argument. But even Pagett had his limits. ""Still not convinced, Sir Eustace?"" he asked, holding up the article for my inspection.",1
"""I’m not entirely convinced,” Tuppence pondered. “It seems to me that once coincidences begin, they tend to persist in the most peculiar ways. Perhaps it's an undiscovered natural phenomenon. Nonetheless, we can't depend on that. However, there are certain locations in London where everyone is sure to pass through eventually. Piccadilly Circus, for example. I was thinking of standing there each day with a tray of flags.” “And what about eating?” Tommy asked practically. “Typical man! Who needs food anyway?” “Easy for you to say. You just had a hearty breakfast.""",1
"“Dr. Wilkins, have you considered the possibility of foul play?"" I asked, studying his reaction closely. He scoffed at the idea. “What you propose is preposterous. Any medical professional would agree. Strychnine is indeed a cumulative poison, but for it to cause sudden death in this manner is simply not feasible. There would have been noticeable symptoms over a period of time, which I would have surely detected. The entire notion is ridiculous.” I pressed further, “What about the theory that Mrs. Inglethorp may have accidentally overdosed?” Wilkins shook his head definitively. “Even three or four doses would not have been fatal. Mrs. Inglethorp's death was no accident.""",1
"The precious Star of the East had vanished without a trace! ""This changes everything,"" I murmured. ""These were no ordinary criminals. They were after this one specific gem."" ""But how did the intruder gain entry?"" ""Through here."" ""But this door is always secured."" I disagreed. ""Not anymore. Look."" I swung it ajar while speaking. A piece of fabric drifted to the floor as I did so. I retrieved it. The silk was intricately embroidered, clearly ripped from a Chinese garment. ""It got caught in the door in his hurry,"" I deduced. ""Quick, let's go. He couldn't have gotten far."" Yet despite our efforts, our search yielded no results.",1
"""Let's start by compiling a list of the survivors."" ""Already taken care of. I made a detailed list of inquiries and sent it over to Mr. Carter. His response came in this morning, and within it was the official record of individuals rescued from the Lusitania. Impressive work, wouldn't you say?"" ""You get top marks for diligence, but none for humility. The real question is, does the list include a 'Rita'?"" ""That's the part that has me stumped,"" Tuppence admitted. ""You don't know?"" ""No. Take a look."" They both examined the list, noticing the scarcity of first names provided.",1
"""Her fingers tightened around the banister before she steeled herself for a confrontation. With determination, she swiftly descended the staircase, passing through the hall and into the boudoir, where she firmly closed the door behind her. A few moments later, as I hurried towards the tennis court, I had to walk past the open window of the boudoir and inadvertently overheard a snippet of conversation. Mary Cavendish's voice, filled with suppressed emotions, asked, 'So you're not going to reveal it to me?' Mrs. Inglethorp's response was calm but firm, 'My dear Mary, it's irrelevant to that situation.' 'Then prove it to me.' 'I assure you, it's not what you think. This is none of your concern.'""",1
"""How are we going to make this decision? As he grappled with this internal dilemma, he kept up a light-hearted conversation with Conrad, provoking the irritable doorkeeper to the brink of murderous rage. Eventually, the door swung open and the German summoned Conrad back inside. “Let’s hope the judge isn’t feeling too harsh today,” Tommy quipped casually. “Lead the way, Conrad. The defendant awaits trial.” The German sat back down at the table and gestured for Tommy to take a seat across from him. “We agree,” he declared sternly, “but under certain conditions.""",1
"“Two pence.” “She must have believed in the saying that good people die young. I suppose I must have some original sin in me to still be around. Where is Two pence, by the way?” “Is she not here?” “No, the guys at the office mentioned she had just stepped out.” “Probably went shopping. I left her here in the car an hour ago. But, come on, can’t you drop the British composure and focus? What on earth have you been up to all this time?” “If you’re hungry,” Tommy replied, “place your order now. This is going to be a long tale.”",1
"“But what is it about him that draws you in? I fail to see any appeal in him, aside from his daring good looks and his modern-day caveman approach to love.” I vented my frustration towards Suzanne for a few moments. “Just because you’re happily married and letting yourself go, you seem to have forgotten about the existence of romance,” I concluded. “Oh, I’m not letting myself go, Anne. The stress of worrying about you lately must have taken a toll on me.” “You appear to be in good shape,” I remarked coolly. “I’d venture to guess you’ve gained at least five pounds.”",1
"I reached out with a trembling hand, my heart racing as I grasped it. The weight was unexpected, sending a jolt of excitement through me. Carefully, I removed the adhesive plaster sealing it shut. As I lifted the lid, a cascade of dull glassy pebbles spilled out onto the surface. ""Pebbles,"" I muttered, my disappointment palpable. ""Pebbles?"" Suzanne exclaimed, her voice filled with disbelief. ""Not pebbles, Anne! Diamonds!"" Diamonds! The word echoed in my mind as I gazed at the glimmering heap before me. Each stone appeared unassuming, like a shard of glass. ""Are you certain, Suzanne?"" I inquired. ""Absolutely, my dear.""",1
"""Oh, please,"" I objected, ""isn't that a bit unbelievable? How could a Chinese man have any influence in Russia?"" Poirot gave me an annoyed look. ""To you, Hastings,"" he remarked, ""anything that doesn't originate from your own mind seems farfetched; whereas I tend to agree with this man. But please, go on, sir."" ""I cannot definitively say what his end goal is,"" Mr. Ingles continued; ""however, I suspect his ailment is a common one among great leaders from Akbar and Alexander to Napoleon a craving for power and dominance.""",1

And then he revealed something unexpected. The original subject of the photograph was Annette, a French girl who had once saved his life."" ""What?"" ""Indeed. Intrigued, I pressed the young man for more information. He confessed that he had returned the photograph to its original place."" The attorney paused, impressed. ""Clever boy, using his wits like that.""",1
"“When we first arrived in Merlinville, do you recall the striking girl at the gate? You mentioned a young goddess, but all I saw was a girl with troubled eyes. That’s how I’ve always seen Marthe Daubreuil. The girl with troubled eyes. Why was she so troubled? It wasn’t about Jack Renauld, as she didn’t know he had been in Merlinville the night before.” “Speaking of Jack Renauld, how is he doing?” “He’s improving. Still staying at Villa Marguerite.”",1
"""The Big Four, always the Big Four!"" Poirot murmured, astonished by the mention of the infamous association. The young mademoiselle recounted the events of the fatal evening, describing how her uncle turned pale with fear at the mere mention of them. It was a dangerous game they were playing, and Poirot knew he had to act fast to save her uncle from their clutches. The chess-board, the table, the seating arrangement of the two men - every detail was crucial in unraveling the mystery at hand.",1
"We never encountered the man from the asylum again, and the inquest, during which I provided testimony, did not capture Poirot's attention. It failed to generate public interest. With his impending journey to South America, Poirot had settled his affairs prior to my arrival, leaving him with no ongoing cases. Despite spending the majority of his time in the apartment, I struggled to engage him in conversation. One day, approximately seven days following the homicide, he invited me to join him on a particular outing.",1
"""She doesn't know him at all."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Absolutely."" ""You don't see any resemblance to the attackers?"" ""No,"" she paused, considering. ""No, I don't believe so. They had fake beards, as the magistrate mentioned, but still no."" Then she made up her mind. ""I'm positive neither of them was this guy."" ""Alright, ma'am. That's all."" With her head held high, she walked out, the sunlight gleaming on her silver hair. Jack Renauld followed, also unable to recognize the man, in a completely nonchalant manner. Giraud simply grunted.",1
"Poirot reappeared at Dover looking brisk and smiling, making our journey to London uneventful. It was well past nine o’clock by the time we arrived, and I assumed we would head straight to our rooms and wait until morning. However, Poirot had different ideas. “We must act quickly, mon ami. The news of the arrest won’t hit the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still time is of the essence.” I didn’t fully grasp his logic, but I inquired about his plan to locate the missing girl. “Do you recall Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? Well, I once helped him with a Japanese wrestler.”",1
"Tuppence's beauty was not conventional, yet her elfin features exuded character and charm. Her determined chin and wide grey eyes, framed by straight black brows, gazed mistily into the distance. A small bright green toque sat atop her bobbed black hair, while her short skirt revealed uncommonly dainty ankles. Though her attire attempted smartness, it was rather shabby. As the tea arrived, Tuppence snapped out of her reverie and began to pour. ""Now,"" Tommy said between bites of bun, ""let's catch up. It's been since 1916 in the hospital."" ""Of course,"" she replied.",1
"Conrad ignited a hissing gas burner and left. Tommy detected the noise of the key turning in the lock. He began inspecting his cell. It was a smaller space than the one below, with a strangely airless feel. Tommy realized there was no window. He circled the room. The walls were disgustingly filthy, much like everywhere else. Four pictures were askew on the wall depicting scenes from Faust. Marguerite holding her box of jewels, the church setting, Siebel with his flowers, and Faust with Mephistopheles. The latter triggered Tommy’s thoughts of Mr. Brown once more.",1
"Renauld immediately followed the old woman upstairs while I lingered in the salon. Poirot eventually emerged with a serious expression on his face. ""There you are, Hastings! By thunder, there are troubles ahead!"" I was taken aback. ""What troubles do you speak of?"" I asked. Poirot, deep in thought, replied, ""I never would have imagined it, but women can be quite unpredictable."" Just then, I spotted Jack and Marthe Daubreuil approaching outside. Poirot hurriedly left the room to intercept them on the steps. ""Do not come in. It's best to stay out. Your mother is in quite a state,"" he informed them. ""I understand, I understand,"" Jack Renauld replied solemnly.",1
"""I will see you later,"" he said before quickly leaving the theatre. I made my way to the hotel, heading straight to the sitting-room. Ordering a whisky and soda, I sat down and stared into the empty grate, lost in thought. The door creaked open, and I turned, expecting Poirot. But to my surprise, it was Cinderella who entered. She spoke in a shaky voice, struggling to catch her breath. ""I saw you earlier with your companion. I followed you from outside. Why are you in Coventry? What were you doing tonight? Is he the detective?"" Her cloak slipped off her shoulders, revealing her stage dress underneath.",1
"A different sort of case was presented to us. Our landlady, Mrs. Pearson, quickly informed us that a hospital nurse had arrived and was waiting to speak with Poirot. We discovered her settled in the large armchair by the window, a friendly-faced woman in her middle years, donned in a dark blue uniform. Initially hesitant, she eventually opened up to Poirot and began to recount her tale. ""You see, M. Poirot, this is unlike anything I've encountered before. I was summoned from the Lark Sisterhood to attend to a situation in Hertfordshire. The individual in question is an elderly gentleman, by the name of Mr.",1
"“Just a bluff. No clue where she’s hiding.” “She sounded pretty sure.” “Probably. I’ve checked it out, we’re in the clear. And it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ call. You wouldn’t want to disobey, right?” The Dutchman muttered something in his native tongue. I assumed it was a quick denial. “Why not just get rid of her?” he snarled. “Easy enough. The boat is ready. We could take her out to sea?” “Agreed,” Chichester pondered. “That’s the way to go. She’s a liability, no doubt about it.",1
"Did her smile vanish, her heart gripped by nameless fear? Or did she ascend the stairs, still smiling, unaware of the impending doom? My heart quickened. Was the house truly deserted? Was doom lurking for me as well? For the first time, I grasped the significance of the oft-used term, ""atmosphere."" There was a sense in this house, a sense of malice, of threat, of malevolence. Pushing aside the oppressive emotions, I ascended the stairs swiftly. Finding the room of the tragedy posed no challenge. On the day the body was found, a heavy rain had fallen, leaving behind large muddy footprints on the bare floor in all directions.",1
"""There was just a single diamond, my friend! Originally part of the Yardly collection, it has now been in Mr. Rolf's possession for three years. He managed to steal it this morning using a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! I must say, watching him on the film, he truly is an artist. “But why would he steal his own diamond?” I inquired, feeling confused. “For various reasons. Firstly, Lady Yardly was becoming impatient.” “Lady Yardly?” “You see, she was often left alone in California. Her husband was off having fun elsewhere. Mr. Rolf, on the other hand, was quite attractive and had a hint of romance about him.""",1

""Honestly, I'm not sure. Sometimes I'm convinced he's completely crazy; and then, just when he's at his most insane, I realize there's a method to his madness."" ""I understand."" Despite her laughter, Mary appeared deep in thought this morning. She seemed serious, almost melancholic. I thought it might be a good time to bring up the topic of Cynthia with her.",1
"""Your lack of manners is truly appalling,"" I remarked icily. ""I'm afraid I must bid you farewell."" He made a move towards the exit, stumbling along the way. Reacting quickly, I guided him to the sofa with a firm hand. ""Stop being foolish,"" I scolded bluntly. ""You wouldn't want to leave a trail of blood throughout the entire ship, would you?"" He appeared to grasp the logic behind my words, sitting still as I tended to his wound as well as I could. ""There,"" I declared, giving my handiwork a satisfied pat. ""That will have to suffice for now.""",1
"She was always giving, but with the expectation of something in return. She never allowed others to forget her generosity, which left her longing for true love. I, on the other hand, made my boundaries clear from the beginning. ""I have my value, and that's where it ends. No extra gifts, no special favors,"" I asserted. While she was often confused and offended by my stance, claiming it was prideful, I knew it was about maintaining my self-worth.",1
"Tuppence has always been the one for me! We were inseparable as kids and that bond only grew stronger with time. I'll never forget the day she visited me in the hospital, dressed in that silly nurse's outfit. It was like a dream come true to see the love of my life playing nurse. But then Julius barged in. ""A nurse's uniform! Oh my goodness, am I losing my mind? I could have sworn I saw Jane in one as well. But that can't be possible! Wait a minute, now I remember! It was her talking to Whittington at that nursing facility in Bournemouth.""",1
"I could still hear his voice echoing in my head: ‘That’s not a bluff! Anyway, a girl her age wouldn’t know any better.’ Little did he realize that American girls mature faster than English ones, showing a keen interest in scientific topics.  After regaining consciousness, Mrs. Vandemeyer was all sugar and spice. She followed her orders, speaking softly in French, informing me of my ordeal and reassuring me that I would recover soon. I feigned confusion, muttering about a supposed injury caused by the 'doctor.' A look of relief washed over her face at my words.",1
"""I am sorry, but I don't see it, Hastings. However, we can now anticipate some of their strategies since we are aware of our weaknesses. For example, my friend, it is crucial that you consider your actions before taking them. Also, if you come across a distressed young woman with red hair, you should be cautious of her words, shouldn't you?"" The notes they had left made ridiculous claims about my impulsive nature and implied that I had a weakness for women with a particular hair color. I found Poirot's insinuations distasteful, but I was quick to push back. ""And what about yourself?"" I challenged.",1
"As I approached Lord Nasby's residence, my heart raced with a mixture of determination and fear. The plan to confront him had been brewing inside me for days, fueled by the memory of our disastrous interview. Normally, such a bold move would be out of character for me, but in that moment, anger propelled me forward. Lord Nasby, the wealthy media mogul behind the Daily Budget, was about to face the consequences of his actions. With each step towards his front door, I steeled myself for the confrontation that awaited.",1
"The two young men met Sir James and the doctor at ten o’clock, as planned. Sir James remained calm, introducing them to the doctor as Mr. Hersheimmer, Mr. Beresford, and Dr. Roylance. The doctor reported that the patient was doing well, but seemed preoccupied. Asked about the Lusitania, she had no concept of time.",1
"""I must say, that was quite clever of you,"" Tommy remarked. ""Especially considering your upbringing."" ""Let's not forget,"" Tuppence interjected, ""that the responsibility lies with them, not us. There's a distinction between taking a diamond necklace for personal gain and being commissioned to do so."" ""The consequences would be the same if you were apprehended,"" Tommy replied. ""True, but I have confidence in my abilities to evade capture,"" Tuppence stated. ""Always so modest,"" Tommy teased.",1
"“Do you plan to keep meeting with Bauerstein despite my objections?”  “If I want to.” “You’re going against me?”  “I’m just saying you can’t control who I’m friends with. Don’t you have friends I wouldn’t like?”  John stepped back, the color draining from his face.  “What are you saying?” he asked, his voice shaking.  “You see,” Mary said calmly. “You see that you can’t tell me who to be friends with.”  John looked at her, a desperate expression on his face.  “No right? Don’t I have a say, Mary?” he asked, his voice faltering. He reached out his hands.",1
"""Remembering Carter's caution, she braced herself for the worst. Despite the overwhelming urge to flee, Tuppence met the woman's eyes with resolve. Satisfied with her initial assessment, Mrs. Vandemeyer gestured towards a chair. 'Please, have a seat. How did you learn about the house-parlourmaid position?' 'A friend of the lift boy recommended me,' Tuppence replied smoothly. Mrs. Vandemeyer's piercing gaze intensified. 'You sound well-educated,' she remarked. Following Mr. Carter's advice, Tuppence fabricated a polished backstory.""",1
"“We’ll take a detour through Regent’s Park!” “Julius, what will the driver think?” “With the salary I give him, he knows better than to have any ideas of his own. You see, Jane, I arranged dinner at the Savoy just so I could give you a ride home. It was the only way I could find to be alone with you. You and Tuppence have been inseparable lately. Another day of it and I would have lost my mind!” “Oh, really?” “Absolutely. Head over heels.” “I had a feeling,” Jane mused. “How so?” “From everything Tuppence didn’t mention!” “You’ve got me there,” Mr. Hersheimmer admitted. But Jane just chuckled.",1
"""Furthermore, the fact that he openly pawned the ring suggests that murder was not his motive. Additionally, a sneak-thief is typically not a killer. Moreover, since he has been incarcerated since Saturday, it would be too coincidental for him to provide such a detailed description of Lowen."" Japp agreed with a nod. ""I'm not saying you're wrong. However, convincing a jury to consider a jailbird's testimony will be a challenge. What baffles me is why Lowen didn't come up with a more clever plan to get rid of the ring."" Poirot simply shrugged.",1
"Inglethorp beckoned you to the window, didn't she?"" ""Yes, she did."" ""Describe to me in your own words what transpired following that."" ""Not much, really. She instructed Willum to pedal to the village on his bike and retrieve a will document, or something similar. I'm not entirely sure what she wrote for him."" ""Go on."" ""He complied, sir."" ""And then what?"" ""We carried on tending to the begonias, sir."" ""Wasn't Mrs. Inglethorp's call for you heard once more?"" ""Indeed, sir, both Willum and I were summoned.""",1
"""I need to inquire, Lady Yardly, about the postmarks on the letters you were sent,"" he asked. Lady Yardly, with a hint of regret, replied, ""I'm sorry, but I can't recall. It never crossed my mind to pay attention to such details."" ""Will you be staying the night?"" Lord Yardly inquired. ""Oh, my lord, I wouldn't want to impose. Our belongings are still at the inn,"" she responded. ""Don't worry about that,"" Lord Yardly quickly interjected. ""We'll have them brought here. It's no trouble at all, I assure you.""",1
"As he entered the room, a wave of guilt washed over him. The harsh words he had spoken lingered in his mind, making him feel regretful. Looking around, he noticed the emptiness of the space. Walking towards the desk, he absentmindedly opened a drawer and found a photograph that immediately grabbed his attention. Frozen in place, he removed the photo, closed the drawer, and sank into an armchair, fixated on the image before him.",1
"I was surprised to find that she really was fond of me. I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. After recovering from our emotions, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you.""",1
"If I had pursued acting, I would have undoubtedly been the most exceptional actor alive! No need for disguises, grease paint, or fake beards - just pure personality! I effortlessly slip into character like a second skin. But when I remove it, I become my true self - unassuming, blending into the crowd. I go by the name Mr. Smith, a common alias among many faces resembling mine. My success in the world of deception was inevitable, just as it will be in my true calling. Failure is not an option for a man of my caliber. I draw parallels between myself and Napoleon as I delve into his biography. And just like him, I have taken up the noble cause of defending the unjust.",1
"""The sea, oh the sea!"" he cried, his voice filled with lament. A week had passed since then, the golden sand of the desert beneath our feet. The blazing sun beat down relentlessly. Poirot, looking utterly miserable, withered by my side. Travel was not his forte, the four-day voyage from Marseilles had been pure torment for him. Upon landing in Alexandria, he was but a shadow of his former self, even his usual impeccable appearance had faded. Our destination was Cairo, and we immediately made our way to the Mena House Hotel, nestled in the shadow of the Pyramids. Egypt's allure captivated me, but Poirot remained unaffected.",1
"Poirot investigated the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had insured his life for a large sum of money. The cause of death was believed to be internal bleeding, but rumors of financial trouble surrounded the deceased. Poirot, accompanied by his friend Hastings, visited Marsdon Manor to speak with Dr. Bernard, the only doctor in the area. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was questioned about the events leading up to her husband's death. She revealed that he had a premonition of his death and had insured his life because of it. As they were about to leave, a tall young man approached them.",1
"“Well, my dear friend, you have observed the fingerprints, now I must reveal the specific object upon which they were left.” “Please, go ahead, I cannot contain my curiosity.” “Ah, behold! Photograph number 3 depicts the greatly enlarged surface of a small vial within the topmost poison cabinet at the infirmary of the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster, a place reminiscent of a labyrinth!” “Oh my goodness!” I cried out. “But what was Lawrence Cavendish’s fingerprints doing there? He never even approached the poison cabinet on the day of our visit!” “Ah, but he did!” “That cannot be true! We were all in each other’s company the entire time.” Poirot simply shook his head. “No, my dear friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.""",1
"""Shall we head up now, ma'am? Just hop in the elevator. Number 20, correct?"" He grinned. Tuppence silenced him with a firm look, then entered. Pressing the bell at No. 20, she noticed Albert's gaze drift downwards. A sharp lady greeted her at the door. ""I'm here for the rental,"" Tuppence stated. ""It's a dreadful spot,"" the lady replied instantly. ""Nosy old lady always prying. Accused me of messing with her mail. Can you believe that? The envelope was barely sealed anyway. She burns everything in the trash can.""",1
"“Absolutely not,” he stated calmly. “We can't rule out the possibility that Dr. Hall might have valuable information for us.” “Oh gosh! I completely forgot about him.” “The odds are low, but we shouldn't dismiss the opportunity. If I remember correctly, he's currently staying at the Métropole. I propose we pay him a visit there as soon as we can. How about after we freshen up with a bath and have breakfast?” It was agreed that Tuppence and Julius would head back to the Ritz, and pick up Sir James in the car. They followed through with this plan, and a little past eleven they arrived at the Métropole. Inquiring for Dr. Hall, a page-boy was sent to find him.",1
"An intriguing case, a truly intriguing case. Surprisingly common, not as rare as one might assume. Numerous well-known comparisons exist. This is the initial instance of this nature that I've witnessed firsthand, and I must confess that it has captivated my attention."" The small man's satisfaction had a somewhat macabre quality. ""And she recalls nothing,"" Sir James stated deliberately. ""Nothing before May 7, 1915. Her memory is flawless from that point onward."" ""So the earliest memory she has?"" ""Is arriving with the other survivors. Everything preceding that moment is a void.",1
"""Hersheimmer, I assumed you were informed."" ""Informed about what?"" ""That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer my responsibility."" JULIUS jumped to his feet.  ""What?"" ""I assumed you knew."" ""When did she go?"" ""Let me think. Today is Monday, right? It must have been last Wednesday - yes, the same night you fell from my tree."" ""That night? Before, or after?"" ""Let me remember - yes, after. An urgent message came from Mrs. Vandemeyer. The young lady and her nurse departed on the night train."" Julius slumped back into his seat.",1
"""I suspect he's been attending chess tournaments to analyze his role. He appears deep in contemplation, as if plotting grand schemes, yet secretly chuckling. He understands only two moves, which is all he requires. It amuses him to anticipate outcomes and manipulate his opponent into self-destruction at the perfect moment for Number Four.... Yes, Hastings, I'm starting to grasp our companion and his mindset."" I simply shrugged.",1
"I gave him fifty cents and that was the end of it. I walked down the corridor to the next car, looking for Whittington. He was there, as expected. Seeing that jerk with his smug face, and thinking about poor Jane in his grasp, made me wish I had a gun. I would have taught him a lesson. ""We arrived in Bournemouth without any issues. Whittington took a taxi to a hotel. I did the same, arriving just a few minutes after him. He booked a room, and so did I.",1
"""The dear fellow isn’t perhaps very bright,” I said thoughtfully. “Here comes Miss Howard,” said Poirot suddenly. “She is the very person. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp. Still, we can but try.” With a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot’s request for a few minutes’ conversation. We went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door. “Well, Monsieur Poirot,” said Miss Howard impatiently, “what is it? Out with it. I’m busy.” “Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?” “Yes, I do.” The lady nodded. “And I told you I’d help you with pleasure to hang Alfred Inglethorp.",1
"""Tell me, Hastings, what is your take on the situation?"" I hesitated before responding, choosing my words carefully. ""It's all quite convoluted,"" I said cautiously. ""Don't you think?"" Poirot's eyes lit up. ""Our sudden departure suggests you believe Mr. Paynter's death was no accident or suicide, but murder?"" ""No, no; you've got it wrong, Hastings. Even if Mr. Paynter's demise was a tragic accident, there are still many unexplained mysteries to unravel.""",1
"I encountered a short, slender individual sporting facial hair, fixating his gaze upon me with intense scrutiny as if I were a specter. His intense emotions piqued my interest, prompting me to investigate further. After some inquiries at the inn, I discovered his identity as Carton, hailing from Kimberley, working as a diamond-sorter for De Beers. The familiar feeling of injustice resurfaced within me, leading me to depart for Kimberley. Despite my efforts, information on him remained scarce. Determined to confront him, I armed myself with a revolver for the impending meeting.",1
"""I urge you not to part with it, George,"" she pleaded, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It holds generations of sentimental value."" She paused, anticipating a response, but met only silence which caused her expression to turn steely. With a nonchalant shrug, she remarked, ""I ought to go prepare myself. I suppose it's time to showcase 'the merchandise.'"" Casting a wry glance at Poirot, she added, ""It truly is one of the most atrocious necklaces to ever exist! George always talks of resetting the stones for me, yet it remains a mere promise."" And with that, she exited the room. Thirty minutes later, the trio convened in the grand drawing-room, awaiting her presence.",1
"He was dressed in a long overcoat with all the buttons done up, and a hat pulled low over his face. ""Sorry for the abrupt entrance, gentlemen,"" he spoke softly, ""but my business isn't exactly conventional."" With a smile, he approached the table and took a seat. I started to stand, but Poirot motioned for me to stay seated. ""Your arrival was indeed unexpected, sir. What brings you here?"" ""Ah, M. Poirot, it's quite simple. You've been causing trouble for my associates."" ""How so?"" ""Oh, come now, Poirot. You know the answer to that question as well as I do.""",1
"Tommy and Tuppence had just added a Gladys Mary and a Marjorie to their collection, only to face a puzzling change of address. They endured a tedious speech on universal suffrage from an energetic American woman named Sadie. ""Ah!"" exclaimed Tommy, taking a sip of beer, ""I feel refreshed. Where to next?"" The notebook rested on the table in front of them. Tuppence reached for it and read aloud, ""Mrs. Vandemeyer, 20 South Audley Mansions. Miss Wheeler, 43 Clapington Road, Battersea.""",1
"When Pagett informed me of his affiliation with the Secret Service, a chill ran down my spine. Memories of his presence in Paris during the War, particularly his interest in Nadina, fueled my growing unease. The suspicion that he was now targeting me gnawed at my thoughts. His unwavering shadowing of my every move only heightened my concerns. Pagett embodied the archetype of the strong, silent man with a hidden agenda. As a whistle pierced the air, Sir Eustace attended to the urgent call. ""Business,"" he muttered before turning to Miss Anne to lead her to her room.",1
"I was struck by the loose waves of her auburn hair and the small, pale hand that reached out for her tea. Her dark eyes and long lashes hinted at a hidden beauty as she settled on the ground beside John. Handing her a plate of sandwiches, she flashed me a smile. ""Join us on the grass, won't you? It's much more pleasant."" I complied, taking a seat beside her. ""You work at Tadminster, right, Miss Murdoch?"" She confirmed, adding, ""Unfortunately, yes."" ""Are they giving you a hard time?"" I inquired, amused. ""I'd like to see them try!"" Cynthia retorted with a touch of pride.",1
"“You might uncover more clues in France.” “Perhaps, my friend, but I am skeptical. It amazes me that the Prime Minister has not been found in that small area, where hiding him would be incredibly difficult. If the military and police of two nations have failed to locate him, how can I succeed?” Mr. Dodge greeted us at Charing Cross. “Meet Detective Barnes from Scotland Yard and Major Norman. They are here to assist you. Best of luck. It’s a tough situation, but I remain optimistic. I must leave now.”",1
"""My friend,"" I exclaimed, ""you must leave tomorrow. I will cover all your costs."" Florence in January was not the typical choice, but Pagett seemed unfazed. I could picture him exploring the galleries, guidebook in hand. A week of solitude was well worth the expense. The past week had been pure bliss. I had indulged in all my desires, free from any unwanted obligations. However, as I awoke to find Pagett blocking the morning light at the ungodly hour of 9 a.m., I knew our time had come to an end.",1
"""He is the Asylum, right? I hear there was a break-out today? What was that again? Hold on a moment. Can you say that one more time? Ah, perfect."" He put down the phone and faced me. ""Did you hear, Hastings? There was no escape."" ""But the person who appeared, the guard?"" I asked. ""I suspect, I strongly suspect."" ""You mean?"" ""The one who ruins everything."" I stared at Poirot in shock. A little later, once I found my voice, I remarked: ""We will recognize him instantly, that's for sure. He had a very distinctive presence."" ""Did he, my friend? I don't think so.",1
"“You wouldn’t even consider it,” “Oh, absolutely, I would, my friend!” Kramenin seemed to have detected a resolve in the tone, as he mumbled reluctantly: “Fine then? I do acknowledge the individual you are referring to, what do you want from me?” “You need to disclose her whereabouts to me right now.” Kramenin shook his head. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I can’t. You are requesting the impossible.” “Scared, huh? Of who? Mr. Brown? Oh, that amuses you! So, he does exist? I had my doubts. And the very mention of him seems to terrify you!” “I have encountered him,” stated the Russian deliberately. “Had a conversation with him in person.”",1
"He was a kind and fatherly man, regarding me as a naive girl facing a harsh world. Despite my efforts to prove otherwise, it seemed futile. In the end, I was left with a mere £87, 17s. 4d. to start a new life. Mr. Flemming proposed I stay with him and his wife in London, a chance I eagerly accepted. As I prepared to leave, I adjusted my appearance to fit the image of an orphan, hoping to make a good impression. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me warmly, though her husband seemed bewildered by my transformation. The day ended with plans for me to seek employment immediately. As I pondered my reflection before bed, I questioned whether my looks truly held any appeal.",1
"""Desjardeaux is currently in London, and I had asked the Home Secretary to ensure his attendance at our meeting today."" The Right Honourable Sydney Crowther, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, was a familiar and well-liked presence. A man around fifty years old, he had sharp gray eyes and a curious expression as he welcomed us with his charming demeanor, a trait that was widely recognized as one of his key strengths. Leaning against the fireplace was a slender, tall individual with a pointed black beard and a face that exuded sensitivity.",1
"The Villa was cloaked in darkness as we approached Mrs. Renauld's bedroom window. Suddenly, a cry for help pierced the silence, followed by a shadowy struggle. Poirot sprang into action, climbing a tree to enter the room through the window. Meanwhile, Cinderella, the acrobat, swung from the roof to rescue Mrs. Renauld. In the end, Marthe Daubreuil was unmasked as the murderer of Mr. Renauld and the would-be murderer of Mrs. Renauld. The night's events left me bewildered and exhausted, with Poirot unraveling the intricate web of motives and lies.",1
"""Sir Eustace, the situation is rather suspicious in my opinion. Just consider my illness before our journey,"" Pagett remarked. Interrupting sharply, I stated, ""Your illness was simply a bout of indigestion. You are prone to such episodes."" Pagett looked uneasy. ""This was different. I suspect foul play."" ""Please spare me the details of your ailment, Pagett. I have no interest in hearing them,"" I replied. ""Very well, Sir Eustace. But I am convinced that I was intentionally poisoned!"" ""Ah,"" I mused. ""You've been influenced by Rayburn."" Pagett remained silent.",1
"As he meticulously examined footprints, the detective failed to organize his thoughts effectively. The inspector produced a key, opening the door to Granite Bungalow. Despite the weather being dry, we made sure to clean our shoes on the mat. A woman emerged from the shadows, engaging the Inspector in conversation before he directed his attention elsewhere. ""Take your time, Mr. Poirot, and investigate thoroughly. I'll return shortly. Also, I have Grant's boot here for you to analyze the imprints.""",1
"I yanked the cabin trunk closer, my voice sharp as I commanded: ""Show yourself now."" Silence greeted me. Leaning down, I spotted my unexpected guest motionless beneath the bunk. Was he asleep? I shook his shoulder, but he remained still. ""Passed out,"" I muttered in frustration. Panic set in as I noticed a crimson stain on the floor. With great effort, I pulled the man into the center of the cabin. His pallid face revealed unconsciousness. It didn't take long to locate the source - a brutal wound beneath his left shoulder. Stripping off his jacket, I focused on addressing the injury.",1
"""Well?"" I asked, taking in the sight of her nestled among the shadows of the trees. Cynthia's hat lay casually beside her, revealing the auburn tresses that glinted like spun gold in the dappled sunlight. Her words were hesitant, yet filled with a sense of urgency. ""Mr. Hastings, you always seem to know the right thing to do. Can you help me?"" It was in that moment, as she looked to me for guidance, that I realized just how captivating Cynthia truly was. So different from Mary, who never sought my advice in matters of the heart. ""Well?"" I prompted gently, urging her to continue. ""I need your counsel. What do you suggest I do?"" ""Do?""",1
"""I have no interest in the body. I want to see Robert Grant,"" said the man. The Inspector hesitated, unsure about allowing him to speak to Grant alone. ""You'll have to come with me to Moreton,"" he finally said. ""I assure you, if you contact Scotland Yard, you will receive full authority,"" replied the man calmly. Despite the Inspector's doubts, he knew the man had helped them before. ""It's irregular, but necessary,"" the man stated firmly.",1
"We climbed into one of the numerous big blue motor-cars parked in the town square. Despite the sweltering heat, Poirot was bundled up in a heavy coat and scarf, leaving only his eyes and ear tips exposed. I couldn't tell if it was for disguise or just his usual paranoia about getting sick. The drive lasted a good two hours, but it was a scenic route. We meandered through towering cliffs, passing by a gentle waterfall along the road.",1
"""Did he have any issues at home? Was the husband and wife getting along?” “His family life seemed peaceful and routine. Mrs. Davenheim was a nice, but not very bright woman. A bit of a nobody, really.” “So, we can rule out any problems there. What about enemies?” “He had a lot of business competitors, and probably some people he outsmarted who didn't like him. But no one with a motive to harm him, and if they did, where's the body?” “Right.""",1
"Poirot and I had arrived at Marsdon Manor to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had recently insured his life for a large sum of money. The circumstances surrounding his death seemed suspicious, especially considering his financial troubles. We spoke to Dr. Bernard, the only doctor in the area, who confirmed that Mr. Maltravers had died from an internal hemorrhage. However, the doctor's vague responses raised some doubts in Poirot's mind. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was distraught and beautiful, and she shared that her husband had insured his life because he believed he would die soon. Poirot noticed a discrepancy in the case, but before we could investigate further, a tall young man approached us.",1
"""I have some questions for you tomorrow, and once you answer, we will know how to proceed. We have ways to make stubborn people talk,"" he said sternly. Despite the grim situation, I was relieved to have until the following day. This man seemed to be following orders from someone higher up. Could it be Pagett? He called for two Kafirs, who escorted me upstairs. Despite my efforts to resist, I was quickly gagged and bound. The room they brought me to was an attic, dusty and seemingly unused.",1
"“His testimony held little significance, merely echoing his brother's account. As he prepared to step back, he hesitated and spoke up: “If I may, I have a suggestion.” The Coroner, with a nod, signaled for him to continue. “I recognize it's just a thought,” Lawrence clarified. “I could be mistaken, but it appears plausible that my mother's passing was due to natural causes.” The Coroner raised an eyebrow, prompting Lawrence to elaborate.""",1
"At ten-thirty Tuppence gazed with satisfaction at the slightly worn tin trunk holding her new belongings. It was neatly secured with cord. With a hint of shyness, she pressed the bell and arranged for it to be loaded into a taxi. Traveling to Paddington, she stored the trunk in the cloak room and then made her way to the seclusion of the ladies’ waiting-room with her purse in hand. A transformed Tuppence emerged ten minutes later, walking modestly out of the station and boarding a bus. Just after eleven o'clock, Tuppence returned to the entrance of South Audley Mansions. Albert was there, half-heartedly tending to his tasks.",1
"""You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?"" interposed M. Bex. ""No, I didn't. But it doesn't surprise me a bit."" ""Why?"" ""Because the old man was rattled! I don't know what it was all about."" ""Terrible, terrible,"" said M. Hautet. ""Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot's, Captain Hastings."" Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. ""Sent for you, did he?""",1
"Reworked text excerpt: The task at hand was intricate, demanding precision. The informant, Coghan, stood before us - tall, weathered, with a touch of gray in his mustache. His demeanor suggested sharp intellect. Back at Crabtree Manor, we wasted no time, entering the study and setting our plan into motion. Pressing on the unassuming bricks revealed a hidden compartment, invisible to the eye. Poirot eagerly reached inside, only to be met with disappointment - a mere scrap of burnt paper.",1
"""As for your inquiry, I am truly clueless."" ""Could you investigate?"" inquired Poirot persistently. ""Certainly, if you truly wish to know."" ""Thank you, my friend. I would appreciate it if you could look into it."" Japp gazed at him for a few more minutes, but Poirot appeared to have forgotten about us both. The detective sadly shook his head at me, and whispered, ""Poor old chap! The war has taken its toll on him!"" before gently exiting the room. While Poirot remained lost in thought, I grabbed a piece of paper and entertained myself by jotting down some notes. My companion's voice snapped me out of it. He had snapped out of his trance and looked lively and sharp.",1
"""As we drove back from the Matoppos that day, I made a decision. And now, I can confidently say that I have followed through. The man you care for is no longer under any shadow of doubt."" ""So that was your intention all along?"" ""Yes, it was."" I felt a wave of guilt for ever suspecting otherwise. He continued, his voice filled with reflection: ""In my youth, I loved a woman who left me heartbroken. I dedicated myself to my profession after that. But when I met you, Anne, everything changed.""",1
"“Is this fool asking to get himself locked up?” Inglethorp was really not doing himself any favors. His feeble attempts at denial wouldn’t fool a toddler. The Coroner quickly moved on, much to Poirot's relief. “You were arguing with your spouse on Tuesday, correct?” “Excuse me,” Alfred Inglethorp cut in, “but you are mistaken. I never had a fight with my beloved wife. This whole tale is completely false. I was away from home the entire afternoon.” “Can anyone vouch for your whereabouts?” “My word is all you need,” Inglethorp declared arrogantly. The Coroner didn’t bother responding.",1
"""[Illustration] “How did you come across this?” I questioned Poirot, my interest piqued. “It was in the trash. Do you recognize the handwriting?” “Indeed, it belongs to Mrs. Inglethorp. But what is the significance?” Poirot simply shrugged. “I cannot be certain, but it is intriguing.” An outlandish thought crossed my mind. Could it be that Mrs. Inglethorp was losing her sanity? Did she entertain some bizarre notion of diabolical influence? And if so, was it not feasible that she had ended her own life? I was on the verge of sharing these speculations with Poirot, when his next words caught my attention.""",1
"He showed great kindness to his brother’s orphaned child, bringing me into his home and caring for me as if I were his own daughter. The estate, Crabtree Manor, may sound grand but is actually just a humble farmhouse. My uncle, deeply passionate about farming, was always trying out new agricultural methods. Despite his affection for me, he held firm beliefs about the proper upbringing of young women. Lacking formal education himself, he placed more importance on practical skills than on academic learning.",1
"“Doesn’t bother me. Need more people like you around. Can’t stand guys who act up. Gets me riled.” She shook her head firmly. “What about you when you’re angry?” I asked, grinning. “Turn into a little demon! Say and do whatever I want! Almost took a guy out once. And he deserved it. Italian blood runs hot in me. Bound to get in trouble one day.” “Please,” I pleaded, “don’t get angry at me.” “Won’t happen. Liked you from the moment I saw you. But you seemed so judgmental, didn’t think we’d become friends.”",1
"""Come on now, sir, you can't underestimate the importance of details as clues, can you?"" ""Not at all. They all have their place. The risk is that they might be given too much significance. Most details are irrelevant; only a few are crucial. It's the mind, the little grey cells,"" he pointed to his head, ""that one must trust. The senses can be deceiving. The truth must be found internally, not externally."" ""Are you suggesting, Monsieur Poirot, that you could solve a case without even leaving your seat?"" ""That's exactly what I mean, provided that the facts were presented to me.""",1
"Tommy sensed a hidden factor at play, causing doubt to creep in. The German's piercing gaze made him question his own knowledge. Tommy's confidence wavered, his grip weakening. He couldn't pinpoint his misstep. Speaking impulsively, he admitted his lack of awareness of all the show's details. Yet, he hinted at a secret advantage, a trump card waiting to be revealed. That's where he intended to gain the upper hand.",1
"""I mentioned Lawrence. It doesn't bother me if Lawrence hates me or not. It's tough when no one loves you, right?"" ""But they do, Cynthia,"" I reassured her. ""You must be mistaken. Look, there's John and Miss Howard."" Cynthia nodded sadly. ""Yes, I believe John likes me, and Evie, despite her rough demeanor, wouldn't harm a fly. But Lawrence ignores me whenever possible, and Mary can barely be civil. She's asking Evie to stay, but doesn't want me, and I don't know what to do."" With that, the poor child began to cry. I acted on impulse.""",1
"""The Count surprised me with his cooperation, but the price I had to pay was exorbitant."" ""How did you settle the debt?"" ""I handed over a stack of Italian banknotes with low denominations. The exchange took place on the spot. The incriminating documents were mine. After that, the Count vanished without a trace."" ""Why didn't you reveal these details during your arrest?"" ""I couldn't risk being associated with him given my circumstances."" ""What's your explanation for that fateful evening?"" ""Someone must have masqueraded as me. They left the apartment empty-handed."" Poirot met his gaze and expressed doubt.",1
"""A shadow flickered across the actress's face as she responded stiffly: ""I'm sorry, but that's not possible."" ""Do you have it on you, hmm?"" Poirot observed her closely. The young woman paused briefly, then reached into the neckline of her dress, pulling out a slender chain. Leaning forward, she opened her hand. Nestled in her palm was a dazzling white gem, expertly placed in a platinum setting, gleaming solemnly at us. Poirot gasped softly. ""Magnificent!"" he whispered.""",1
"But, at that moment, where was Poirot? I watched him closely. He projected an air of innocence, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. His calm demeanor seemed too serene and relaxed to offer any comfort. Through my experience with Poirot, I had come to realize that the more harmless he appeared, the more dangerous he actually was. His tranquility unsettled me. Sensing my unease, he smiled kindly. ""You seem perplexed, Hastings? Wondering why I haven't taken action?"" ""Something along those lines."" ""That's what you would do if you were in my shoes. I get it.""",1
"""We will go to meet Sir Guy Willard. He was eager to know when you would arrive,"" Dr. Tosswill informed us. Leading us through the camp, we reached a spacious tent. Dr. Tosswill opened the flap and we stepped inside. Three men were seated there. ""Sir Guy, Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings are here,"" announced Dr. Tosswill. The youngest man among them stood up excitedly and approached us, bearing a resemblance to his mother in his impulsive demeanor.",1
"""What do you think about the elderly lady?"" I inquired abruptly. ""She was left alone in the residence once Grant departed to get the milk. It's possible she murdered him before leaving. If she didn't step outside, there would be no footprints to trace."" ""Impressive deduction, Hastings. I had considered that possibility myself and dismissed it. Betsy Andrews is a familiar face in this area. She has no ties to the Big Four. Furthermore, old Whalley was a formidable man, as the rumors suggest. This appears to be the handiwork of a man, not a woman.""",1
"""I'll challenge you to a game of quoits tomorrow,"" he declared. I remained silent. ""Do you think you'll never bounce back? I've seen others in worse shape than you, and within two days they were the life of the party. You'll see."" I wasn't in the mood to flat out call him a liar. I tried to convey it through a look. After a few more minutes of pleasant conversation, he thankfully left. Couples walked by, children played, and young people laughed. A few other pale patients, like myself, reclined in deck chairs. The air was refreshing, cool but not too cold, and the sun shone brightly.",1
"The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet.",1
"Starting with his failed surveillance mission in Bournemouth, he then moved on to coming back to London, purchasing the car, Tuppence's increasing worries, visiting Sir James, and the dramatic events from the night before. Tommy inquired, ""But who is the murderer?"" ""I'm a bit confused,"" he added. ""The doctor deluded himself into thinking she was the one who took it,"" Julius responded sarcastically. ""And Sir James? What was his opinion?"" ""As a legal expert, he is also quite closed off,"" Julius replied. ""I'd say he 'withheld his opinion.'""",1
"""Always twisting the facts to fit the theory! Did Giraud not discover traces of a man and a woman in the shed? How does that align with his case reconstruction? It doesn't, and so we must dismiss them! Is this a methodical approach? The esteemed Giraud! He is merely a self-important balloon. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he looks down upon, will be the pin to burst that balloon."" Hercule Poirot paused, then continued, ""Undoubtedly, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will reveal the truth.""",1
"She was pale, but with a smile on her face. “I deduced from that premise. Mrs. Cavendish is in her mother-in-law’s chamber. Let’s assume she’s searching for something she hasn’t found yet. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp wakes up and is gripped by a violent fit. She flails her arm, knocking over the bedside table, then frantically pulls the bell. Mrs. Cavendish, startled, drops her candle, spilling wax on the floor. She retrieves it, and hastily retreats to Mademoiselle Cynthia’s chamber, shutting the door behind her. She rushes into the hallway, ensuring the staff doesn’t discover her whereabouts.",1
"""To be honest, my dear Hastings, the case has become quite clear to me, except for the words 'Yellow Jasmine'. I am beginning to see your point that they may not be relevant to the crime. In these situations, you must determine who is telling the truth. I have made my decision. And yet..."" With that, he abruptly left my side and disappeared into a nearby bookstore. After a few minutes, he returned, clutching a parcel. Japp joined us, and we all made our way to the inn. The next morning, I woke up late. As I entered the sitting-room designated for us, I saw Poirot already there, pacing back and forth with a pained expression on his face.",1
"""I must admit, I can no longer hide the truth. You appear to be quite knowledgeable.” “I have utilized my intellect to my advantage. Let me be direct, Signor Ascanio, you paid a visit to the deceased on Tuesday morning, correct?” “Indeed; however, I did not return the next evening. It was unnecessary. Allow me to explain. This villain had obtained sensitive information about a prominent figure in Italy. He demanded a hefty sum for the documents. I traveled to England to settle the issue. I met with him as scheduled that morning. A young secretary from the Embassy accompanied me.""",1
"Jack rushed to catch his train in Paris after a heated argument. Léonie, who witnessed his departure, couldn't understand the cause of the dispute due to the language barrier. Poirot decided to wait in the salon while I went to investigate Giraud's activities. As I made my way through the shrubbery, I unexpectedly collided with a young lady, who turned out to be Cinderella. She confessed to being intrigued by the murder at Villa Geneviève and begged me to show her the crime scene. Shocked by her morbid curiosity, I hesitated, unsure of what to do next.",1
"""I vehemently deny your accusations,"" I retorted. He flashed a reassuring smile, ""I trust you completely, Miss Redmond. I have never doubted your loyalty. However, there is someone on this ship who has been aware of my secrets from the start. All it takes is one word from him and I am done for. Nonetheless, I am willing to gamble on the chance that he remains silent."" ""And why is that?"" I inquired. ""Because he is a man who prefers to work alone. Once the authorities apprehend me, I will no longer be of any value to him. Perhaps, I might even gain my freedom. Only time will tell."" His laughter was tinged with mockery, yet his expression turned steely.",1
"""The revolver at Ealing was a mistake, a clue that led me on the right track. The criminals wanted the police far from Derbyshire, so they planted it there. It wasn't the one used to shoot Mr. Pace, which Mrs. Havering did slyly. Despite Japp's efforts, they escaped justice. But fate caught up with them later. Bond robberies were on the rise, including the disappearance of a million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia. Miss Farquhar sought Poirot's help, as her fiancé was blamed for the theft. The bonds were entrusted to him by his uncle, Mr. Vavasour, and disappeared during the voyage.""",1
"""Are you denying this as well?"" The Coroner presented him with the register containing his forged signature. ""Of course, this is not my handwriting. Let me prove it to you."" He retrieved an old envelope from his pocket, wrote his name on it, and passed it to the jury. The disparity was evident. ""So, how do you explain Mr. Mace's accusation?"" Alfred Inglethorp responded calmly, ""Mr. Mace must have been confused."" The Coroner paused before asking, ""As a formality, could you please disclose your whereabouts on the evening of Monday, July 16th?"" ""I'm afraid I cannot recall."" ""This is preposterous, Mr.""",1
"Nadina, a captivating Russian performer who had captivated the audience in Paris, gracefully acknowledged the applause with a bow. Her dark eyes narrowed slightly as her crimson lips formed a subtle smile. The French spectators cheered fervently as the curtain descended, concealing the vibrant colors of the extravagant set. Dressed in flowing blue and orange fabrics, the dancer exited the stage. A man with a beard eagerly embraced her - the Manager.",1
"Poirot handed back the worn English letter with a grave face. The magistrate assumed that M. Renauld was involved with an Englishwoman named Bella, leading to jealousy and threats. The case seemed simple at first, with a woman as the likely culprit due to the stabbing, but Poirot pointed out that the digging of the grave was a man's work. The masked men and the mysterious letter further complicated the investigation. The magistrate suggested looking into M. Renauld's past in Santiago for clues to his murder. Poirot agreed, praising the idea. The magistrate also mentioned involving M. Renauld's wife in the investigation and confirmed that there were no other letters from Bella among M. Renauld's belongings.",1
"Poirot and I sat on the grassy knoll facing the sea, reviewing the case of Jack Renauld. I pondered over the details, considering Madame Daubreuil's connection to the Beroldy Case. Suddenly, a thought struck me - Georges Conneau. Poirot was impressed by my revelation, encouraging me to continue. We assumed Conneau was alive and had a vendetta against Renauld, leading to a fatal encounter. Madame Daubreuil's involvement and a cover-up scheme unfolded in my theory. Poirot, however, pointed out the unrealistic aspects of my reconstruction, suggesting it belonged in the movies. I defended my theory, but Poirot's skepticism lingered.",1
"""Poirot, what do you make of this?"" I asked, watching as he scanned the letter with intense concentration. After a moment, he looked up and replied thoughtfully, ""It appears to be a classic case of deception and betrayal. The question is, who is the true mastermind behind it all?"" I nodded, pondering his words. ""Do you think it's someone close to the victim?"" I inquired. Poirot's eyes gleamed with a hint of mischief. ""Ah, but in matters of crime, my dear Hastings, one must always consider all possibilities. Even those that seem most unlikely.""",1
"I found myself staring ahead, a sense of confusion settling in. Norman and I were a formidable pair, capable of handling any challenge. Surprisingly, our journey continued northward, bypassing London altogether. This unexpected detour left me bewildered. Gradually, as the car decelerated, the familiar sights of Hendon Aerodrome came into view. Poirot's plan became clear to me in an instant - we were to fly to France. While bold, the idea seemed impractical at first glance. Sending a telegram would undoubtedly be faster. Time was of the essence, and Poirot would have to forego the personal accolades of saving the Prime Minister. As we came to a stop, Major Norman exited the vehicle, replaced by an undercover officer.",1
"""I believe, Captain Hastings, it is time to put pen to paper. Here is a form for a telegram. The contents of what I write will be determined by you, and will decide the fate of your beloved wife."" Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. The person before me maintained a pleasant smile, showing no signs of concern as he casually spoke: ""Go on, captain, the pen is in front of you. All you need to do is write. Otherwise..."" ""Otherwise?"" I interjected. ""Otherwise, the woman you hold dear will face a slow and agonizing death. My employer, Li Chang Yen, takes pleasure in creating new and sophisticated methods of inflicting pain..."" My reaction was immediate and desperate.",1
"I doubt she'll ever give me an explanation. No one ever does. I'm always left to figure it out on my own. It gets old pretty quick. I guess it's all part of the journalist game. “Navigating the rapids,” according to our Special Correspondent. After putting away the telegram, I politely excused myself from my Government contact. While I'm not thrilled about the idea of going hungry, I'm not concerned for my safety. Smuts is more than equipped to handle any uprising.",1
"""But, Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls, though I only found out yesterday."" ""You knew!"" I exclaimed. ""Interestingly enough, it was Pagett who spilled the beans. He droned on about a pointless story involving a bet and a tin of films. It didn't take me long to connect the dots - Mrs. Blair's suspicion of Colonel Race, her nervousness, her plea for me to look after her souvenirs. The eager Pagett had already opened the cases. So, before exiting the hotel, I discreetly moved all the film rolls into my own pocket. They're right over there in the corner.""",1
"“Listen here, that one is not meant for you! Trust me,” warned Papa Poirot. “But why,” I exclaimed, “the commissary assured me she was not only beautiful, but also virtuous! An absolute angel!”Poirot chuckled, “Some of the most notorious criminals I've encountered had the charm of angels. A deviation in the brain's cells can easily mask itself behind the face of innocence.”Shocked, I protested, “Poirot, you can't possibly think that a young, innocent girl like her could be involved in this!”“Now, now, calm down! I never said I suspected her of anything,"" Poirot replied calmly.",1
"""Poirot was struck with shock. The nurse, misunderstanding his reaction, began to speak softly. ""She passed without pain, and was unconscious at the end. It was a hit-and-run by a car, and the driver didn't even pause. Terrible, isn't it? I hope someone noted the license plate."" ""The universe is working against us,"" Poirot whispered. ""Would you like to say goodbye?"" The nurse led the way, with us behind. Poor Flossie Monro, her fake hair and makeup. She was at peace, a faint smile on her face. ""Yes,"" Poirot whispered.",1
"""I am certain of it,” declared Poirot calmly. “May I ask a few questions, on behalf of your nephew? Who was responsible for ordering this lock from Hubbs’s?” “I took care of it myself,” Mr. Shaw responded. “I did not want to leave it in the hands of a clerk. As for the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two were kept by my associate and I.” “Have any clerks had the opportunity to access them?” Mr. Shaw glanced at Mr. Vavasour for confirmation. “To my knowledge, they have remained untouched in the safe since we placed them there on the 23rd,” Mr. Vavasour stated. “Unfortunately, my associate fell ill two weeks ago, on the very day that Philip departed from us.""",1
"I had been dancing with Colonel Race several times that evening and we eventually ended up sitting in deck-chairs, engaged in conversation. He seemed to have a lot of knowledge in a particular subject, but I couldn't help but notice a few mistakes he made. One in particular stood out - he referred to the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian, which was a clear error. As I retired to my cabin that night, I couldn't shake the feeling that he might have been testing me, perhaps suspecting that I was not who I claimed to be. It was a puzzling thought that lingered in my mind as I drifted off to sleep.",1
"""I'm still trying to wrap my head around how you managed to pull it off. The story you spun about the dead child seemed so flimsy, yet she bought it hook, line, and sinker."" ""Countess is more perceptive than you give her credit for, my friend. She fell for my initial disguise, but quickly caught on. The moment she uttered, 'You're quite the clever one, Mr. Poirot,' I knew she had figured it out. That's when I had to play my trump card."" ""All that talk about resurrecting the dead?"" ""Indeed, but the twist was that I had the child right there with me the whole time."" ""What?"" ""Yes! Always remember my motto: Be prepared.""",1
"""I say, what about that rug? No, not the rug itself. It's a real beauty, too good to have a big nail carelessly stuck right through it. Nope, old chap,"" as I stepped closer, ""the nail's gone now. But the hole's still there."" A sudden noise from behind caused me to whirl around, and Poirot leapt up agilely. A young woman stood in the doorway. Her gaze, fixed on us, was filled with suspicion. She was of average height, with a lovely yet somewhat moody face, deep blue eyes, and jet-black hair that was cropped short. Her voice, when she spoke, was deep and melodious, and distinctly non-English. ""I'm afraid my uncle won't be able to meet with you.",1
"As various individuals attempted to make small talk in the casual setting of a boat, I couldn't help but notice how Mrs. Blair skillfully rebuffed their advances. It was clear that she had chosen the strong, silent man as her companion for the journey, and he seemed to appreciate the position. The next day, to my surprise, Mrs. Blair interrupted my solitude after a stroll with her companion. ""Feeling better today?"" she inquired. I expressed my gratitude for her concern, admitting that I was starting to feel more human. ""You looked quite unwell yesterday. Colonel Race and I were almost looking forward to a sea burial, but you've thwarted our plans,"" she remarked with a teasing smile. I chuckled in response.",1
"She carefully examined the portrait of Rev. Edward Chichester, tilting her head to the side. ""An excellent likeness. Now, onto the rest."" Handing me the paper, she inquired, ""Is that your stewardess?"" Excitedly, I confirmed, ""Yes, that's Suzanne. How did you know?"" She brushed off the praise. ""I've always been suspicious of Chichester. Remember how he reacted when we mentioned Crippen? And he attempted to claim Cabin 17!"" ""It's all coming together,"" I agreed.",1
"""Oh, Monsieur Poirot, I am grateful to see you. I've heard of you before. You are nothing like those Scotland Yard folks who refuse to listen or empathize. And the French Police are even worse, in my opinion. They are all convinced that my husband has run off with another woman. But that's not like him! All he cared about was his work. That was the source of half our arguments. He valued it more than me."" ""Englishmen, that's how they are,"" Poirot said comfortingly. ""If it's not work, it's games, sports. They take all those things very seriously.""",1
"As I watched the tall young man approaching, his lean, deeply bronzed face caught my attention. It spoke of a life in a tropic clime. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered upon seeing him, her face noticeably blanched. ""You,"" she gasped. ""I thought you were on your way to East Africa."" The young man explained that news from his lawyers had detained him, as his uncle in Scotland had unexpectedly left him some money. At that moment, Poirot stepped forward, making introductions and emphasizing our imminent return to London. We quickly made our way to the Anchor Inn where Captain Black was staying, ready to investigate his connection to the events surrounding Mr. Maltravers' death.",1
"""It never occurred to you how strange it was for a renowned London doctor to seclude himself in a small village like this, and to be seen strolling around fully dressed at all hours of the night?"" ""No,"" I admitted, ""I never considered such a thing."" ""He is actually German by birth,"" Poirot mused, ""although he has been practicing in this country for so long that no one regards him as anything other than English. He became a naturalized citizen about fifteen years ago. A very intelligent man, a Jew, of course."" ""The scoundrel!"" I exclaimed angrily. ""Not at all. On the contrary, he is a patriot.",1
"“Even Hercule Poirot couldn't solve this one,” my friend chuckled. “I'm going to start the investigation now. Just had to make my case to you first. But mark my words, I'll be proven right; and once I've given Japp a heads up, he'll have enough to nab the upstanding Mr. Graves. I'm curious how much of the money he's already blown through.” Poirot's intuition was spot on, as always, curse him! The case brought to us by Miss Violet Marsh was a welcome departure from our usual mundane tasks. Poirot had received a concise and professional note from the woman requesting a meeting, to which he responded by setting up an appointment for eleven o'clock the next morning.",1
"I will reveal everything. A man in Italy had incriminating information and demanded a large sum of money for it. I traveled to England to settle the matter. Meeting the man, I paid him in Italian notes for the papers. He gave them to me and I never saw him again. When arrested, I denied any involvement. I believe someone impersonated me that evening. No money was found in the flat. Poirot seemed puzzled, mentioning the window-curtains and coffee stains. He deduced that Graves orchestrated the whole scene, even staging a fake dinner party. Poirot's deduction impressed me, as always. Miss Violet Marsh visited Poirot with a unique request, detailing her family history from Devonshire.",1
"Poirot analyzed the situation carefully. ""They did not leave through the door. They left by the window,"" he declared. His statement left me puzzled, trying to understand the implications of such a revelation. The open door now seemed like a distraction, a red herring to divert attention from the real method of exit. The window provided a much more discreet and efficient way for the perpetrators to leave the scene undetected. This new perspective shed light on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr. Renauld's death and opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for our investigation.",1
"""The contents of her letter truly revealed her feelings of love, making any offer of money an insult. Eventually, he managed to dismiss her, and the choice of his words was telling."" ""'Please, leave now,' I urged. His words seemed forceful, but necessary."" ""He was eager for her to depart, not just due to the discomfort of the meeting. No, it was the ticking clock that mattered, time held significance for some unknown reason."" ""Why the rush?"" I inquired, puzzled. ""This is the question we ponder.""",1
"She resembled Cinderella, youthful but consumed by a craving for dark thrills, for excitement at all costs, disregarding decency and empathy. Despite the allure of her beauty, I couldn't shake my initial disapproval and aversion. Thoughts of my deceased mother flooded my mind. What would she think of this peculiar, modern version of girlhood? The painted pretty face masking a sinister mind within. ""Get off your pedestal,"" the woman interjected abruptly. ""And drop the pretentious act.""",1
"The idea excites you, I can tell. You always gravitate towards the extravagant and romantic."" The next day found us settled into our temporary residence. The apartment was tastefully decorated. Though it was on the same floor as the Robinsons, it was situated two levels above. The day following our move-in was a Sunday. During the afternoon, Poirot cracked the front door open, then urgently beckoned me over as a loud noise echoed from below. ""Peer down the stairs. Are those individuals your acquaintances? Make sure they don't spot you."" I leaned over the railing. ""Yes, that's them,"" I whispered clumsily.",1
"He made a point to steer clear of any mention of the notorious Big Four, instead immersing himself in his daily tasks with renewed dedication. Despite his outward appearance of normalcy, I couldn't shake the feeling that he was deeply involved in something significant. Strange Slavic individuals, with their peculiar appearance, frequently sought audience with him. While he provided no insight into these clandestine interactions, it was evident that he was devising a formidable defense or countermeasure alongside these enigmatic foreigners.",1
"“Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that fateful night, and if not Marthe, then who did he see?” “Poirot, you can’t possibly think a young man like him would kill his own father,” I exclaimed. “My friend, your naivety is astonishing! I have witnessed mothers who have slain their own children for money. After that, nothing surprises me.” “And the reason?” “Greed, as always. Jack believed he would inherit half of his father’s wealth upon his demise.” “But what about the vagrant?”",1
"Meanwhile, the battle rages on."" ""I hope,"" I mused, ""that only those deserving are the ones meeting their demise. Those who truly sought conflict, not innocent residents caught in the crossfire."" He nodded in agreement. ""I understand your sentiment, Anne. The injustice of war. But I have something else to share with you."" ""What is it?"" ""I must confess my own failure. Pedler has successfully fled."" ""What?"" ""Indeed. His escape remains a mystery to all.""",1
"""Blair, my dear lady, I must say, your observation about Mr. Pagett is quite intriguing,"" remarked Sir Eustace, with a hint of amusement in his voice. ""Indeed, his face does not inspire confidence in his innocence, does it?"" Mrs. Blair gave a knowing nod, and Colonel Race chimed in, ""Six years is quite a long time to have someone so invaluable in your service, Sir Eustace."" The conversation flowed effortlessly, with mentions of dancing, ghosts in cabin 17, and the mysterious Mr. Chichester. As the evening progressed, secrets and suspicions lingered in the air, leaving Sir Eustace pondering the true intentions of those around him.",1
"Since the conclusion of the Conflict, he had resided in at least half a dozen various apartments and townhouses. Almost immediately after settling in a new place, he would stumble upon a different opportunity and promptly move out. Most of his relocations resulted in a small financial profit, showcasing his astute business acumen. However, his primary motivation was the thrill of the chase rather than monetary gain. As we absorbed Parker's words, we were filled with admiration for his expertise. When it was our chance to speak, a chaotic exchange of words ensued. Eventually, Mrs. was the last one standing.",1
"He was no less fanciful than the average young Englishman, yet he couldn't shake the feeling that an unusually powerful force radiated from the man. The man reminded him of a deadly snake. Moments later, his feeling was confirmed. The newcomer knocked on the door like the others, but his reception was starkly different. The bearded man stood up, and the rest followed suit. The German approached and shook hands, his heels clicking together. ""We are honored,"" he said. ""We are greatly honored. I feared it would be impossible."" The other replied in a hushed voice with a hint of a hiss: ""There were obstacles.",1
"At the same time, if news of my getaway reached Chichester, along with the fact that I had departed Cape Town for Durban, it would be easy for him to disembark at Port Elizabeth or East London and evade me completely. It presented quite a dilemma. ""Let's look into train schedules for Durban regardless,"" I suggested. ""And there's still time for morning tea,"" added Suzanne. ""We can enjoy it in the lounge."" The train to Durban was scheduled for departure at 8:15 that night, as confirmed by the office. I held off on making a decision for now and joined Suzanne for a rather late ""eleven-o'clock tea.""",1
"“I agreed silently. “So, what about the murder weapon?” “I have an idea, Captain Hastings. There were two revolvers that belonged to my husband displayed on the wall. One is now gone. I informed the authorities about this, and they confiscated the remaining one. Once they retrieve the bullet, the truth should come to light.” “Can I visit the gun-room?” “Of course. The police have already searched it. However, the body has been taken away.” She led me to the location of the murder.",1
"After conversing with Colonel Race, Suzanne announced her fatigue and retired to bed. Unwilling to stay alone with him, I also stood and made my way to my own room. Despite my restlessness, I found myself unable to sleep. Instead of changing into nightclothes, I reclined in a chair, lost in reverie. An ominous sense of impending danger loomed nearer with each passing moment. Suddenly, a sharp rap at the door startled me from my thoughts. Approaching cautiously, I opened the door to find a young boy holding out a mysterious note addressed to me in an unfamiliar handwriting. Accepting the note, I returned to the room, puzzled by its contents.",1
"The crime was clearly an elaborate setup orchestrated by an unknown individual to frame the prisoner. Despite the prosecution's efforts, there was no concrete evidence linking the prisoner to the purchase of the black beard from Parkson's. While the prisoner did have a strained relationship with his stepmother and was facing financial difficulties, these facts were blown out of proportion. Sir Ernest casually acknowledged Mr. Philips' argument that an innocent man would have come forward during the inquest to clear his name.",1
"""Come see the truth of my words with your own eyes. They will have traced me to the entrance of the Labyrinth of Felsen by now."" As he spoke, a distant rumble echoed through the air, prompting a man to burst in with frantic words. Ryland leaped to his feet and hurried out, while Madame Olivier revealed a hidden door at the back of the room. Through it, I glimpsed a meticulously prepared laboratory akin to the one in Paris. Number Four also rose suddenly and left, only to return with Poirot's revolver for the countess. ""There is little chance of their escape,"" he stated with a grave tone. ""Nevertheless, it is best that you have this.""",1
"“There’s a certain cold precision in his manner that was missing from the real doctor. Plus, a doctor wouldn’t typically check for the heart on the right side of the chest.” “Are you saying he did that?” “Yes, I didn’t pick up on it right away, but I had a feeling something was off. It all clicked for me later when I got home.” “Interesting,” remarked the detective. He slowly pulled out a pen and paper. “By examining the upper body, he could easily have taken whatever he pleased from the pockets.” “I find that hard to believe,” the detective replied.",1
"Beside him lay the empty cup. I quickly went to his side, then hurried out and made my way across the camp to Dr. Ames’s tent. “Dr. Ames!” I shouted. “Hurry.” “What’s wrong?” asked the doctor, emerging in his pajamas. “My friend. He’s sick. Dying. The chamomile tea. Stop Hassan from leaving the camp.” The doctor sprinted to our tent. Poirot was still on the bed. “Incredible,” exclaimed Ames. “Looks like a fit or something he ingested?” He examined the empty cup. “But I didn’t drink it!” a calm voice declared. We spun around in surprise. Poirot was now sitting upright.",1
"The well-dressed women in the room huddled together, whispering so loudly that the judge warned them to quiet down or face removal. Evidence was scarce, with handwriting analysts examining the signature of ""Alfred Inglethorp"" in the poison register. They all agreed it did not match his handwriting, suggesting it could be a clever forgery by the prisoner. Under further questioning, they conceded it could be an expert imitation of the prisoner's handwriting.",1
"“I mentioned bolted, indicating that it was secured, and I couldn't open it, but I think all the doors were discovered bolted from the inside.” “Nevertheless, from your perspective, the door could have just as easily been locked?” “Absolutely.” “You yourself didn't happen to observe, madam, when you went into Mrs. Inglethorp's room, whether that door was bolted or not?” “I I think it was.” “But you didn't actually see it?” “No. I didn't look.” “But I did,” Lawrence interjected suddenly. “I happened to notice that it was bolted.” “Ah, that confirms it.” And Poirot appeared dejected.",1
"In a matter of moments, the door swung open abruptly. Conrad made his entrance, accompanied by the menacing Number 14. Tommy's heart plummeted at the sight of them. ""Good evening, sir,"" the man sneered. ""Have the ropes, buddy?"" The quiet Conrad produced a piece of thin rope. In a flash, Number 14's skilled hands began to wrap the cord around Tommy's limbs, while Conrad restrained him. ""What in the world?"" Tommy started to say. But the glacial, wordless smile from Conrad silenced him. Number 14 skillfully continued with his work. Soon, Tommy was rendered completely powerless. Finally, Conrad spoke: ""Thought you could outsmart us, huh? With what you knew, and what you didn't know.""",1
"""Poirot's smile was cryptic as he held up the key he had retrieved from the lock of the despatch-case upstairs. Dorcas seemed dumbfounded. 'That's it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked everywhere for it.' Poirot's eyes twinkled. 'Ah, but you see, it was not in the same place yesterday as it was today.'""",1
"""Can you estimate his height? Maybe around six feet?"" ""I believe so."" ""He was completely clean-shaven, correct?"" ""Yes, not a trace of a moustache."" ""Did his chin have a shiny appearance?"" I inquired suddenly. Mrs. James gazed at me in astonishment. ""Come to think of it, miss, it did. How did you know?"" ""Interestingly, murderers often have shiny chins,"" I declared excitedly. Mrs. James took my word seriously. ""Is that so, miss? I had no idea."" ""Did you notice anything distinctive about his head?"" ""Just a regular head, miss.""",1
"Her stunning beauty caught my eye as she basked in the sunlight, giving off an aura of innocence and isolation. I reached out, grasping her delicate hand, and found myself blurting out the words: ""Will you marry me, Cynthia?"" To my surprise, this unexpected proposal seemed to dry her tears instantly. Sitting up abruptly, she withdrew her hand and retorted sharply: ""That's ridiculous!"" Irritated by her response, I persisted: ""It's not ridiculous. I am asking you to be my wife, will you accept?""",1
"""I came to the realization that the corpse had been burned."" ""But for what reason? What was the motive?"" ""Listen, if one were to shoot a man, or stab him post-mortem, or even bludgeon him, it would be obvious that the wounds occurred after death. However, with his skull reduced to ashes, nobody will bother searching for hidden causes of death, and an individual who narrowly evaded poisoning during a meal is not expected to be poisoned right after. Who can you trust, that is the real issue? I made the choice to trust Ah Ling."" ""What!"" I cried out.",1
"No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",1
"“Hence, it is imperative that we locate him.” “Agreed, but how?” exclaimed Tuppence. “I’ve exhausted all possibilities.” Sir James grinned. “However, there is someone in close proximity who most likely has information on his whereabouts, or at least a clue.” “Who might that be?” inquired Tuppence, perplexed. “Mrs. Vandemeyer.” “True, but she won’t cooperate.” “Ah, but that is where my expertise comes into play. I believe I can persuade Mrs. Vandemeyer to divulge the information I seek.” “How?” questioned Tuppence, widening her eyes in disbelief.",1
"I noticed the importance of being aware of every aspect of our lives. The letter I received was written in a way that seemed familiar to me. By mentioning that the Chinese man who visited me was trying to ""lead me astray,"" it negated any positive impact my ""signature"" of four books may have had. It was a trap, but I was able to see through it, something Poirot would surely recognize. The timing was also well thought out. Poirot would only just have enough time to follow the note with his seemingly innocent companion, which I was certain he would do. My decision to enter the house would prompt him to come rushing over.",1
"""Let's finish it up tomorrow,"" Cynthia declared. ""Could you possibly have it ready tonight?"" ""We're swamped, but we'll try to make time,"" Cynthia replied graciously. The nurse left, and Cynthia grabbed a jar, refilled the bottle, and placed it outside the door. ""Maintaining discipline, huh?"" I chuckled. ""Exactly. Come out to the balcony. You can see all the outside wards from there,"" Cynthia said, leading the way. I followed as Cynthia and her friend pointed out the different wards. Lawrence stayed inside, but Cynthia called him to join us. Glancing at her watch, Cynthia asked, ""Anything else, Nibs?"" ""No.""",1
"""Blair greeted me on deck, beckoning me to sit beside him. 'Good morning, Gipsy girl,' he said, noting my tired appearance. I questioned his use of the nickname, to which he explained, 'It suits you somehow. I've always thought of you that way. It's the gipsy element in you that sets you apart.' I found it amusing that we both considered each other to be the most interesting company on board, excluding Colonel Race. 'You're such an exquisitely finished product,' I remarked, mirroring his earlier sentiment.""",1

Though your words against my late husband cut deep, I am growing old and hold you dear to my heart. Yours lovingly, Emily Inglethorpe Presented to the jury, who examined it closely. ""Unfortunately, it does not offer much assistance,"" the Coroner remarked with a hint of disappointment. ""There is no reference to the incidents of that fateful day."" ""Crystal clear to me,"" Miss Howard interjected briefly.",1
"Renauld plans to disguise himself as a tramp, making his escape from the station on the 12:10 train without raising any suspicion. The unexpected arrival of Bella threatens to derail his carefully orchestrated scheme, forcing him to act quickly to eliminate her interference. With every passing moment crucial to the success of his plan, Renauld wastes no time in dispatching Bella and setting in motion the next phase of his deadly plot. Leaving the front door slightly open, he skillfully manipulates the scene to divert attention from his true intentions.",1
"“Did you find anything in Renauld’s belongings?” inquired Poirot. “We conducted a thorough search of his study, sifting through his personal papers. Unfortunately, we came up empty-handed. Everything appeared to be in order and nothing caught our attention, except for his will. Take a look.” Poirot quickly perused the document. “I see. A generous bequest of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor – do you know who he is?” “He was Mr. Renauld’s secretary. Although he primarily resided in England, he did visit here occasionally for short periods.” “And the rest of his estate was bequeathed to his dear wife, Eloise. The will is simple, yet legally binding.”",1
"""The truth is undeniable. But how did you come by this information?"" Marthe questioned with a hint of embarrassment. Poirot's face twisted in displeasure. ""Secrecy is non-existent in cases like this! However, it makes no difference. So, what are you curious about, mademoiselle?"" After a moment of hesitation, the girl finally gathered the courage to ask, almost in a hushed tone: ""Has anyone been singled out as a suspect?"" Poirot observed her intently before responding vaguely, ""Suspicions are circulating, mademoiselle.""",1
"The young woman is quite astute. Single-handedly, it seems, she has uncovered the true identity of the deceased woman found in my residence. The victim was a Russian performer named Nadina. When I inquired with Anne Beddingfeld about the accuracy of this information, she claimed it was a deduction in the style of Sherlock Holmes. Nevertheless, it appears she has already sent this information to Nasby as an established fact. Women possess these instincts, and I am confident that Anne Beddingfeld's assumption is correct, although labeling it a deduction is preposterous. How she secured a position at the Daily Budget is beyond my comprehension.",1
"He remained motionless, his eyes shut tight, only the slightest rise and fall of his chest indicating that he was still alive. A doctor monitored his pulse, his expression grave. ""He's fading fast,"" he murmured. ""You recognize him, don't you?"" I shook my head. ""I've never crossed paths with him."" ""Then why does he have your name and address in his possession? You are Captain Hastings, correct?"" ""Yes, but I'm just as puzzled as you are."" ""Strange. According to his documents, he was in the service of a man named Ingles, a retired government official. You're familiar with him, aren't you?"" he asked sharply, noticing my reaction to the name. Ingles's servant! Suddenly, it clicked - I had encountered him before.",1
"They were a striking pair, the tall, dark young man and the blonde beauty standing together. Despite the dark cloud of tragedy hanging over them, they exuded happiness. The girl appeared uneasy, a fact not lost on Jack Renauld, who pulled her in closer and inquired, ""What troubles you, my love? What haunts you now?"" As she gazed back with the same fearful expression Poirot had mentioned, she whispered softly, almost revealing her thoughts, ""I fear for your safety.""",1
"""We need incriminating evidence to stop the Cabinet from turning against him so easily. What do you know about the other individuals involved? You mentioned recognizing two of them, right? Is one of them affiliated with the Labour party? Take a look at these pictures and see if you can identify him."" Shortly after, Tommy presented a photograph. Mr. Carter appeared taken aback. ""Ah, Westway! I wouldn't have guessed. Tries to come off as moderate. And as for the other person, I have a strong suspicion."" Passing another picture to Tommy, he grinned at the ensuing reaction. ""I was correct, then. Who is he? An Irishman. Well-known Unionist M.P. It's all a façade, obviously.""",1
"And the moral of the story is that a criminal's lack of originality will be their downfall. They will repeat the same crime in the same way, leading to their inevitable capture. This lack of creativity in criminal behavior is a key clue for detectives like Hercule Poirot. The small details, like a wristwatch gaining two hours or footprints in a flower-bed, can reveal the true identity of the criminal behind the acts. When Gabriel Stonor, the well-travelled secretary, enters the scene, his connections and insights shed new light on the case. His lack of knowledge about certain names and incidents, like Duveen and Bella, only adds to the mystery at hand. The truth is out there, waiting to be uncovered.",1
"""It's a small, elegant spot nestled between Bolougne and Calais. Lately, it's been gaining popularity among wealthy Brits seeking tranquility. Does M. Renauld own property in England?""

He's rumored to have significant business dealings in South America, primarily in Chile and Argentina."" ""We'll find out more from the man directly. Let's get ready to leave.""",1
"Pagett abruptly left the table midway through dinner, leaving me slightly irritated since I had intended to bid him farewell. However, I assumed Sir Eustace could serve the same purpose. After finishing my meal, I approached Sir Eustace. ""Farewell, Sir Eustace,"" I declared. ""I depart for Durban tonight."" Sir Eustace let out a weary sigh. ""Yes, I heard about your plans. Would you prefer some company on your journey?"" ""I would appreciate it."" ""Lovely girl. Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather join me in searching for lions in Rhodesia?"" ""Absolutely."" ""The man must be quite dashing,"" Sir Eustace remarked with a hint of sadness.",1
"""It occurred to me at that moment that despite my willingness to sacrifice myself, I should have at least been consulted. Then I recalled Poirot's insistence that I remain behind, which eased my mind. ""And how exactly will sacrificing yourself benefit anyone?"" Ryland asked sarcastically. ""You clearly do not grasp the true depth of Hercule's strategy. For starters, your hiding place was discovered months ago, and nearly everyone around – from hotel staff to visitors – is a detective or Secret Service agent. The mountain is surrounded. You may think you have multiple escape routes, but there is no way out.""",1
"""He was unfamiliar with Hercule Poirot's techniques. Unlike Poirot, he preferred to work internally, relying on his intuition and intellect rather than frantic legwork. This approach, he believed, was more effective. Poirot's dismissive attitude towards certain investigative methods sparked a debate. While fingerprints had indeed solved cases, Poirot pointed out the potential for wrongful convictions. His skepticism was met with resistance.""",1
"We managed to track down Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent, after a long search. He recognized the name Bella Duveen as one of the Dulcibella Kids, a pair of acrobat and singer sisters currently performing in Coventry. Poirot decided to attend their variety show, where he saw them perform and recognized Cinderella as one of the sisters. After the show, Cinderella approached us in fear, confessing that she was the one who took the dagger and asking if we would turn her in to the police. In a surprising turn of events, I declared my love for her and promised to protect her.",1
"As soon as the crash of crockery echoed from the attic above, the men sprang into action, scrambling up the creaky ladder and vanishing into the shadows. Without hesitation, Tommy bolted from his concealment, hurtling down the staircase and dragging the girl along. The hall was empty. Frantically, he struggled with the locks until they finally gave way, the door swinging open. Whirling around, he found Annette gone. A mix of confusion and frustration washed over Tommy. Why would she go back upstairs? Anger boiled within him, yet he remained steadfast in his position.",1
""" Tommy stopped suddenly. A moment of silence passed. “By the way,” Julius interjected, “you're mistaken about Jane's photo. It was taken from me, but I recovered it.” “Where?” Tuppence exclaimed. “In the small safe on Mrs. Vandemeyer's bedroom wall.” “I knew you discovered something,” Tuppence said accusingly. “To be honest, that's what made me start suspecting you. Why keep it to yourself?” “I suppose I was a bit suspicious as well.""",1
"On the following night, Tommy ventured out alone to investigate the area surrounding the house. Despite his efforts to move quietly, he couldn't help but make more noise than he intended. As he approached the dining-room window, he saw a group of people inside, enjoying a drink together. The scene was calm and peaceful, far from the danger he had anticipated.",1
"The clever heroine always found herself in the clutches of the Master Criminal, facing death in unusual ways. Fortunately, the hero always came to her rescue just in time.

Papa's focus on science clashed with practical matters, leaving Anne to sort out the details. The prospect of an adventure in Rhodesia excited Anne, but she couldn't help noticing her father's mismatched boots.",1
"""Ingles examined the Chinese pottery pieces with great interest. Poirot inquired, ""You seem uninterested in this investigation, monsieur?"" The man smiled slowly and replied, ""It's not my expertise. I appreciate art, but not this. I prefer to observe from a distance. My time in the East taught me patience."" The Inspector entered, apologizing for the delay. After going over the details again, we were able to leave. Poirot thanked the Inspector, saying, ""I am grateful for your many kindnesses. There is one more favor I wish to ask of you.""",1
"After thoroughly inspecting the table and its precise placement, he requested to examine the chess pieces. They were brought to him by Sonia Daviloff in a decorative box. He casually looked over a couple of them. ""A truly exquisite set,"" he commented absentmindedly. There was no inquiry about the refreshments served or the guests in attendance. I tried to speak up, but he cut me off abruptly. ""Do not trouble yourself with thoughts, my dear friend. Leave everything to me. Mademoiselle, is there any chance I could speak with your uncle?"" A slight smile appeared on her lips. ""He will be available to see you, yes. Just so you know, it is my duty to speak with all visitors first.""",1
"Poirot and I sat on the grassy knoll, overlooking the sea, reviewing the case. The bathers' cries reached us faintly, the sea pale blue in the calm. Poirot encouraged me to arrange my ideas methodically. Madame Daubreuil's connection with the Beroldy Case was key. I had a sudden epiphany about Georges Conneau. Poirot embraced me warmly, impressed. I theorized that Conneau, driven by old grievances, had killed Renauld. Madame Daubreuil was involved, and Jack Renauld had been manipulated. Poirot appreciated the story but pointed out the lack of realism in my reconstruction. I defended my theory, suggesting Conneau had obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil. Poirot disagreed, questioning the plausibility of my supposition.",1
"This clarifies the reason for their willingness to hand over everything to Halliday so easily. Madame Olivier was the dominant force, with Vera Rossakoff as her right-hand woman. Madame required Halliday's concepts, while she possessed the brilliance to fill in the gaps that confounded him. Indeed, Hastings, we are now aware of the true identity of Number Three - the woman who may be the most brilliant scientist in existence! Consider that. The intellect of the East, the technology of the West, and two others whose names remain a mystery. However, we must uncover them. Tomorrow, we shall journey back to London and commence our investigation.",1

Julius seemed on edge, a mix of nerves and excitement evident in his trembling hand as he brought the glass to his lips. Despite his defiance, he eventually averted his gaze, conceding defeat. “For now, you have the upper hand,” he muttered. “Thank you,” replied the other calmly. “Shall we settle for ten o’clock?” With a smooth transition, he redirected his attention to Tommy. “I must admit, Mr. Smith, I am intrigued by your proposal.”",1
"""Sentiment means everything to a woman, does it not? But a man like you, who lacks such delicate sensibilities, may find some small comfort in that fact."" ""Of course, of course,"" Mr. Opalsen replied, somewhat uncertainly. ""Still..."" His words were cut off by a triumphant shout from the inspector. He entered the room, holding something between his fingers. Mrs. Opalsen sprang up from her seat with a cry. She looked like a different person. ""Oh, my necklace!"" she exclaimed, holding it tightly to her chest. We all gathered around her. ""Where was it?"" Opalsen demanded. ""In the maid's bed.""",1
"Inadvertently, Mademoiselle Marthe revealed the truth about another matter, contradicting Jack Renauld in the process. His noticeable pause when questioned about seeing Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime raised suspicions of deceit. To confirm my doubts, I needed to speak with Mademoiselle Marthe before Jack could warn her. Just three simple words from her provided the crucial information I sought. When I inquired if she was aware of Jack Renauld's presence that night, her response was simply, ""He informed me.""",1
"""I need those documents before I release you,"" the voice demanded. Tommy chuckled, ""Do you expect me to find them while I'm chained up here?""   ""What's your proposal, then?""   ""I require freedom to handle this situation as I see fit.""  The German scoffed, ""Do you take us for fools? We won't let you stroll out of here with just words.""  Tommy pondered for a moment, ""I knew you wouldn't agree to that. Let's find a middle ground.""",1
"Tuppence couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at outsmarting the other taxi driver. She quickly took note of his number, planning to send him a postal order the next day to cover any damages. Suddenly, there was a loud grinding noise followed by a jarring bump as another taxi collided with theirs. Without missing a beat, Tuppence was out of the taxi and handing the driver five shillings before disappearing into the crowd with Jane. As they made their way through the bustling streets, Tuppence couldn't help but feel the thrill of the chase.",1
"""It certainly is,"" Tuppence drawled, ""especially with old man Rysdale's backing. But don't worry, kid. If this pans out, you'll be in from the beginning."" With that assurance, she said goodbye to her new partner and strode energetically away from South Audley Mansions, pleased with her morning's accomplishments. However, time was of the essence. She headed straight back to the Ritz and penned a brief message to Mr. Carter. After sending it off, and with Tommy still not back, which was no surprise, she embarked on a shopping spree that included a break for tea and various creamy pastries, keeping her busy until well past six o'clock. By the time she returned to the hotel, she was weary but content with her acquisitions.",1
"""Are you joining me?"" Tommy shook his head. ""What's the point? One of us should be sufficient. I'll stick around here a bit longer and snoop. You never know what might pop up."" ""Alright then. See you soon. I'll return shortly with some inspectors. I'll make sure to choose the sharpest and most skilled."" However, events did not unfold as Julius had anticipated. Later that day, Tommy received a telegram: ""Meet me at Manchester Midland Hotel. Urgent news JULIUS."" At 7:30 that evening, Tommy got off a sluggish train from the countryside. Julius was waiting on the platform. ""Figured you'd take this train if you didn't receive my telegram in time.""",1
"Poirot spent only a brief moment at each stop, yet his confidence seemed to grow with each one. He exchanged a few words with Norman, who pointed towards a side road saying, ""They are waiting by the bridge if you go left."" As we veered off onto the side road, I noticed a second car parked along the roadside in the dwindling light. Two men in civilian clothing sat inside. Poirot stepped out and conversed with them briefly before we set off towards the north, with the other car trailing closely behind.",1
"I reached my destination early the next morning, where I was greeted by a mysterious Dutchman with a short black beard. Without a word, he ushered me into a waiting car and we sped off. In the distance, a strange booming sound echoed through the air, prompting me to inquire about its origin. ""Guns,"" was his curt reply. The realization that there was conflict in Jo'burg sent a thrill through me. Our target, it seemed, lay hidden somewhere in the city's suburbs. With each turn and detour we took, the sound of gunfire grew louder, heightening the tension. Finally, we came to a stop in front of a rundown building.",1
"""She entered the building, and I chatted with the lady at the front desk, acting as if I was accompanying her. Eventually, I made my way inside as well."" He paused, the room filled with an uneasy quiet. ""You have to trust me, Anne. I swear on my life that everything I'm about to tell you is the truth. I followed her into the building with vengeance on my mind, only to discover her lifeless body! I stumbled upon her in that upstairs room, it was a sight straight from hell. Lifeless, and yet I had barely missed her by mere minutes. And there was no trace of another soul in sight! I instantly grasped the dire situation I found myself in.""",1
"The doctor repeatedly pressed the doorbell, but there was no response from inside. Frustrated, he turned to the lift attendant and inquired about a pass-key. The attendant mentioned one being in the porter's office downstairs. Poirot suggested calling the police, which the doctor agreed with. After a short absence, the attendant returned with the manager, who demanded an explanation for the commotion. The doctor explained that they had received a distressing call from Count Foscatini, claiming he had been assaulted and was in critical condition.",1
"""I couldn't believe my eyes as I examined the thick paper in front of me. It didn't seem like the usual notepaper at all. A sudden realization hit me like a ton of bricks. ""Poirot!"" I exclaimed. ""This is a piece of a will!"" ""Precisely."" His response caught me off guard. ""You're not shocked?"" ""No,"" he replied seriously, ""I anticipated it."" Handing over the fragment, I observed as he meticulously stored it in his case, just as he did with everything else. My mind was racing with questions.""",1
"The wind howled outside, sending chills down my spine. With a creak, the door to the room swung open, causing her to gasp in fear. ""This door must be cursed!"" exclaimed Poirot, frustration evident in his voice. He rose to shut it firmly, securing it with a key. ""I will lock it like this!"" ""Please don't,"" she whispered, her voice filled with dread. But before she could finish, the unthinkable occurred. The locked door creaked open slowly, as if moved by an unseen force.",1
"As the men gathered in the hall for breakfast, their voices echoed up the stairs, causing me great unease. I knew I had to remain patient in order to find a way out of the house without being caught. After breakfast, I heard the sounds of Chichester leaving, and to my relief, the Dutchman followed suit. Waiting anxiously, I took note as breakfast dishes were cleared and the household chores commenced. Finally, as the commotion subsided, I cautiously emerged from my hiding spot and stealthily made my way down the staircase.",1
"The gun was yanked out of his grasp, and Julius Hersheimmer's voice drawled: “Looks like you've been caught red-handed with the loot.” The K.C.’s face flushed, but he maintained his composure, shifting his gaze between his two captors. His eyes lingered on Tommy. “You,” he muttered. “You! I should have guessed.” Sensing his lack of resistance, they loosened their hold. In a swift motion, his left hand, adorned with a large signet ring, moved to his lips. “‘Hail, Caesar! Those who are about to die salute you,’” he said, still staring at Tommy.",1
"""The length of a clue, my friend, holds significance regardless of its size - a two-foot clue is just as crucial as one that measures two millimeters! It is a misconception that only tiny clues are important. As for the lead-piping, dismissing its relevance simply because Giraud said so is a mistake. Let us not discuss this further. Let Giraud continue his investigation, while I pursue my own thoughts. The case appears to be clear-cut, and yet, my friend, I am not convinced. Do you know why? It all comes back to the wristwatch that is two hours ahead. Additionally, there are a number of peculiar details that do not quite align.""",1
"""No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, do you happen to have it on you? I would quite like to take a look at it."" I had brought along the paper as Exhibit A, and I passed it to her.

Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 as well?” “There's a gap,” I observed. “Indeed, there is a gap, but” Suddenly, she stood up and leaned over the paper, bringing it as close to the light as possible. There was a barely contained thrill in her demeanor. “Anne, that’s not a dot! It’s a defect in the paper! A defect in the paper, do you understand? Therefore, you must disregard it and focus solely on the spaces, the spaces!” I rose to my feet and stood beside her.",1
"How much did Poirot really know? Was he aware that my fellow passenger on the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same person? What was the reason for his visit to the Hôtel du Phare? Was it truly on my behalf, as I had initially believed? Or was I simply being naive, and was there a more sinister motive behind his actions? Regardless, why was he so determined to locate this young woman? Did he suspect her involvement in Jack Renauld's murder? But that couldn't be possible! She had no reason to harm the victim, no motive for his death. So why did she return to the scene of the crime? I meticulously reviewed all the details.",1
"The accusation was outrageous! To think that she would be implicated in stealing from Madame! The authorities were notoriously incompetent! However, Monsieur, a Frenchman ""A Belgian,"" Poirot interjected, but Célestine ignored the correction. Monsieur refused to let her be wrongly blamed, especially when that scandalous chambermaid was walking free. She always distrusted her, a brazen, rosy-cheeked woman, clearly a thief. From the beginning, she had a feeling that she was untrustworthy.",1
"""The audacious audacity of that diminutive fellow! Who but Poirot would have considered a murder trial as a means to reconcile a troubled marriage! ""I can see the skepticism in your eyes, my friend,"" Poirot remarked with a grin. ""Only Hercule Poirot could have concocted such a scheme! And you are mistaken in your disapproval. The joy of a single man and a single woman is the most precious treasure in the world."" His statement triggered a wave of memories. I recalled Mary, pale and drained, reclining on the couch, her ears strained for every sound. Suddenly, the doorbell rang. She jolted upright. Poirot answered the door, exchanging a silent, reassuring glance with her.""",1
"""The master detective has not failed us yet,"" Hawker remarked, patting him on the back. ""There is always something to ponder."" ""Indeed, there is,"" he replied. ""Take, for instance, the door."" ""The door? But it was locked. No one could have entered or exited through it. I made sure of it."" ""And why were you so certain?"" The doctor appeared confused. Poirot quickly clarified. ""I am referring to the keyhole. It was not covered. Quite peculiar. And then there was the tea. It was exceptionally bitter."" ""So what?"" ""Exceptionally bitter,"" Poirot emphasized.",1
"""Oh, what a beauty she is, cellela!” The elderly woman exclaimed with a hint of disdain. “Madame Daubreuil,” whispered the police commissioner in disbelief. “Inconceivable.” “Well, there you have it,” grumbled Françoise. “That's what happens when you speak the truth.” “Not necessarily,” the judge interjected calmly. “It was unexpected, that's all. So, Madame Daubreuil and Monsieur Renauld, they were...” he paused tactfully. “Ah? Was it truly them?” “Who's to say? But what can you do? Monsieur was a very wealthy English lord and Madame Daubreuil, despite her humble lifestyle, was quite elegant,” expressed the examining magistrate thoughtfully.",1
"The Flemmings observed the Daily Budget, which was experiencing a day that resonated deeply with its essence. SHOCKING CONTINUATION OF SUBWAY TRAGEDY.

"""We need more information."" ""How so?"" Poirot leaned back in his chair, adjusting a box of matches I had carelessly tossed on the table. I could tell he was gearing up to lecture. ""Listen, Hastings, we are up against four opponents; four distinct personalities. We've never met Number One face-to-face, we only know him through his thoughts. And let me add, Hastings, I am starting to grasp his thoughts quite clearly - a cunning and Eastern mind. Every plan we've faced has come from Li Chang Yen's brilliant brain.""",1
"The room was adorned with curtains and portière in a muted green hue, perfectly complemented by the matching carpet.

It seemed we were trapped, as the rebels had taken control of a new section of the city. Our sanctuary was a remote farm about twenty miles from Johannesburg, situated in the open veld. Exhaustion weighed heavily on me.""",1
"""Rarely do you visit us these days,"" Poirot scolded. ""It has been almost a month since the incident with the Yellow Jasmine.""   ""I've been traveling up north. How have things been for you?

But they're not as significant as you think.""   ""My friend, you are mistaken. The Big Four are the epitome of evil in the world today. Their end goal remains a mystery, but there has never been a more formidable criminal organization.""",1
"""You must trust your gut instincts,"" I exclaimed. ""It may sound ludicrous, but I have a hunch that Miss Howard is hiding something!"" ""Miss Howard?"" ""Yes, I know it may seem far-fetched,"" I stammered, ""but I can't shake the feeling that we may have overlooked her as a suspect just because she was out of town. Yet, she was only fifteen miles away. A quick car ride could easily get her back in half an hour. Can we really be certain that she wasn't at Styles on the night of the murder?"" Unexpectedly, Poirot replied, ""Yes, my dear friend, we can.""",1
"""Then it's settled on the maid,” declared the inspector, satisfied, before resuming his search. Moving on to the maid’s bedroom next door, Poirot furrowed his brow in thought. Abruptly, he turned to Mr. Opalsen with a pointed question. “Was this necklace insured, no question about it?” Mr. Opalsen appeared slightly taken aback by the inquiry. “Yes,” he replied with hesitation, “that is correct.” “But why does it matter?” Mrs. Opalsen interjected tearfully. “I want my necklace back. It was one of a kind. No amount of money could replace it.” “I understand, madame,” Poirot reassured her. “I understand completely.”",1
"Célestine vehemently denied the accusations, claiming she never saw the pearls. The inspector, however, remained suspicious and decided to search her. Despite finding nothing, Poirot proposed a little experiment. Célestine reluctantly agreed and repeated her actions of fetching a reel of cotton and scissors from her room. Poirot observed closely, making notes in his pocket-book. After the experiment, Célestine was cleared of suspicion, leaving the inspector to search the room thoroughly to find the missing pearls.",1
"But, during lunch-time, a new revelation emerged - the absence of evidence. We had tirelessly searched for the missing fourth letter penned by Mrs. Inglethorp on the fateful night before her demise. Despite our fruitless endeavors, we eventually ceased our pursuit, holding onto the hope that it would resurface on its own accord someday. And indeed, fate intervened as a correspondence arrived via the afternoon mail from a French music publishing company. They acknowledged Mrs. Inglethorp's payment but expressed their regret at being unable to locate a specific collection of Russian folk songs.",1
"""Inglethorp and Miss Howard,” she said, giving me a disconcerting look. “Would it really be such a catastrophe if they were to cross paths?” I was slightly caught off guard by her question. “Don’t you think so?” I asked. She smiled quietly. “No, I don’t. I would enjoy seeing some sparks fly. It might help clear the air. Right now, everyone is thinking so much, but saying so little.” “John disagrees,” I pointed out. “He wants to keep them apart.” “Oh, John!” The way she said it sparked something in me, and I blurted out, “John is a really good guy.” She studied me for a moment, then surprised me by saying, “You are a loyal friend.”",1
"I was taken aback by the sudden appearance of the mysterious woman in my compartment. She was young, with a face covered in powder and lips painted an impossibly bright red. Her impudent demeanor and shocking language made me frown, but her infectious laughter soon broke through my reserve. Despite her unconventional behavior, I found myself unable to resist her charm. With a toss of her head, she declared us friends and demanded an apology for her missing sister. I obliged, feeling strangely drawn to this rebellious stranger.",1
"As we approached the excavation site, a man with a grey beard, dressed in white and a helmet, approached us. ""Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We got your message. I apologize for the absence of a welcoming party in Cairo. A sudden turn of events messed up our plans."" Poirot's face lost color. His hand reached for his clothes-brush but halted. ""Another fatality?"" he whispered. ""Indeed."" ""Sir Guy Willard?"" I asked. ""No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider."" ""And the reason?"" Poirot inquired. ""Tetanus."" I felt my blood drain from my face.",1
"""John greeted us with a tired expression as we approached the house. ""This situation is quite dire, Monsieur Poirot,"" he stated. ""Hastings has made it clear that we wish to avoid any unwanted attention."" ""I understand completely."" ""At this point, it's only a suspicion. We have no solid leads."" ""Exactly. We're just being cautious."" John then turned to me, pulling out a cigarette and lighting it. ""You're aware that Inglethorp has returned?"" ""Yes, I've seen him."" After casually tossing the match into a nearby flower bed, Poirot couldn't help but intervene. He picked it up and discreetly disposed of it. ""It's quite tricky figuring out how to handle him.""",1
"""I don't know,"" I murmured. ""I have this uneasy feeling that something terrible is on the horizon."" Suzanne shook her head firmly. ""Ridiculous,"" she scoffed. ""Let's shift our focus. Anne, those jewels..."" ""What of them?"" I inquired. ""I fear they may not be secure in my possession any longer. Previously, it was inconspicuous, but now that our close relationship is common knowledge, I may come under scrutiny."" ""But no one suspects they're concealed within a roll of film,"" I countered. ""It's a brilliant hiding spot, and I doubt we could find a better one.""",1
"Julius’ narrative style was nothing short of captivating, even if it did stray from the truth at times. As the chauffeur slowed down, he informed Julius that they were approaching Gatehouse. Julius instructed the Russian to guide them to the house, planning to drive directly to their destination. Knowing that Little Willie would not accept any mistakes, Julius made it clear to Kramenin that failure was not an option. After the intense journey, Kramenin was completely under Julius' control, feeling utterly defeated. The car glided up the driveway and came to a stop in front of the porch.",1
"""My dear friend, do not let your mind wander. Recall the partially torn cheque and the name Bella Duveen, faintly recognized by Stonor. It is safe to say that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack's mysterious correspondent, the one who visited Villa Geneviève that fateful night. We cannot be sure if she sought Jack or his father from the start, but it seems likely. She presented her demands to Jack, possibly revealing incriminating letters, prompting the older man to offer payment with a cheque. This she defiantly ripped apart.""",1
"""Yes. The shape matched Mr. Inglethorp’s precisely, with a few snipped hairs. This case runs deep,” commented Poirot. “Who stashed it in the chest, I wonder?” “Clearly someone quite clever,” noted Poirot dryly. “He selected the only spot where it wouldn’t be noticed. Yes, clever indeed. But we must outsmart him. We must appear so unassuming that he never suspects our true intellect.” I agreed. “Your help will be invaluable,” Poirot acknowledged graciously.",1
"Jack rushed to catch his train in Paris after retrieving his bag from the library. Léonie shared a story about his anger, but the details of the dispute remained a mystery. Poirot decided to wait in the salon while I ventured out to find Giraud. As I made my way through the dense shrubbery, I unexpectedly collided with Cinderella, who seemed eager to explore the crime scene at Villa Geneviève. Despite my reservations, she insisted on seeing all the gruesome details, leaving me unsettled by her morbid curiosity.",1
"""The problem will be resolved soon,” Poirot said calmly. John appeared confused, not fully grasping the significance of this mysterious statement. He passed the pair of keys given to him by Dr. Bauerstein over to me. “Allow Monsieur Poirot access to everything he wishes to examine.” “Are the rooms locked?” inquired Poirot. “Dr. Bauerstein deemed it necessary.” Poirot pondered for a moment. “So, he is quite certain. Well, that makes things easier for us.” Together, we ascended to the scene of the crime. For ease, I have included a layout of the room and its main furnishings.""",1
"He restrains and silences Madame Renauld, rectifying his error from two decades earlier, ensuring the tightness of the restraints this time to avoid implicating his partner. Despite this, he ensures she is equipped with the identical tale he fabricated previously, illustrating the mind's aversion to deviation. The evening air is cold, prompting him to don an additional coat over his garments, planning to discard it alongside the deceased in the burial site. Exiting through the window, he meticulously smooths the soil in the garden, inadvertently providing damning proof of his involvement.",1
"""Ridiculous!” “Not at all! Haven't you witnessed impersonators in music halls mimicking famous personalities with uncanny precision? It's a piece of cake to pretend to be someone in the public eye. The Prime Minister of England is a much simpler target to mimic than an average Joe like Mr. John Smith from Clapham. And as for O’Murphy’s doppelgänger, no one would have paid him any attention until after the Prime Minister had left, at which point he would have vanished. He travels from Charing Cross directly to his rendezvous with accomplices. He enters as O’Murphy, and exits as an entirely different person. O’Murphy has vanished into thin air, leaving behind a conveniently suspicious trail.""",1
"""I'm not sure."" He then blushed and continued with sudden intensity: ""Why did I say that? I truly loved my father. We exchanged harsh words the last time I saw him, and we argued often about my reckless behavior and debts, but I held affection for the old man. I realize now how much I cared, now that it's too late,"" he added more calmly. ""It was during my time at Cambridge that I encountered the other individual."" ""Young Eardsley?"" ""Indeed, young Eardsley. His father, as you are aware, was a prominent figure in South Africa. We immediately formed a bond, my companion and I.""",1
"“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, shaking his head in a dismissive manner. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, standing up, “all this is very intriguing, but I must take my leave.” “One moment, my dear Pedler, one moment, I implore you. Now, tell me, in confidence, do you not plan on traveling to South Africa soon yourself? You have significant investments in Rhodesia, I understand, and the issue of Rhodesia joining the Union is one that greatly concerns you.”",1
"""We were unceremoniously escorted out. 'I am not satisfied,' Poirot murmured, stepping onto the sidewalk. 'Were you hoping for more revelations? Those old codgers are not exactly a thrilling bunch.' 'It's not their lack of excitement that bothers me, my friend. I am not anticipating a Bank manager to embody a 'sharp-eyed financial wizard' as your beloved novels portray. No, I am let down by the simplicity of the case!' 'Simple?' 'Indeed, isn't it almost laughably easy?' 'You already know who took the bonds?' 'I do.' 'Then why must we...?' 'Don't get ahead of yourself, Hastings. We are to remain idle for now.""",1
"Then, his expression brightening, he hurried over to the desk. Within moments, he was sifting through the deceased man's checkbook. After a moment, he gestured with excitement. The final stub was left untouched. ""Courage!"" exclaimed Poirot, giving him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. ""Undoubtedly, Madame Renauld will have valuable insight into this enigmatic individual known as Duveen."" The police commissioner's demeanor lightened. ""You're right. Let's move forward."" As we prepared to exit the room, Poirot offhandedly mentioned: ""This is where M. Renauld entertained his visitor last evening, correct?"" ""Yes, but how could you possibly know that?"" ""By this. I discovered it on the rear of the leather armchair.""",1
"Mrs. Blair has been cooperating with us since the beginning. I got the note dictated by you, it was just as I anticipated. Race and I had already talked about the possibility of a hidden passage in the curio shop, and he had found where the exit was located.” Suddenly, there was a loud ripping noise, followed by a powerful blast that reverberated through the room. “They're bombing this part of the city. I need to get you out of here, Anne.” A sudden burst of light illuminated the scene as the house across the street went up in flames. Sir Eustace stood up and began pacing back and forth. Harry aimed the gun at him, keeping him in check. “It's over, Sir Eustace, the jig is up.”",1
"I never thought about venturing into that specific market before. But when I observed the defendant in the courtroom, I couldn't help but notice his sheer stupidity. Even his lawyer's words couldn't possibly save him. I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of disdain towards him. That's when it hit me - the bar for criminals was set quite low. It seemed to attract the dregs of society, the ones who couldn't make it anywhere else. It made me wonder why more intelligent individuals hadn't seen the potential in this field. The possibilities seemed endless. As I delved into books about crime and criminals, my excitement only grew. The more I read, the more I realized the untapped opportunities waiting for someone like me.",1
"""But he exerts his influence from afar, making things happen behind the scenes."" ""Is there no one brave enough to stand up to him?"" Poirot inquired. Mr. Ingles leaned in closely. ""Four individuals have attempted to challenge him in the past four years,"" he spoke deliberately, ""individuals of integrity, intelligence, and resolve. Any one of them could have disrupted his schemes given enough time."" He paused. ""And then?"" ""And then they met their demise. One dared to write an exposé, linking Li Chang Yen to the uprisings in Pekin, only to be fatally attacked in public mere days later. The perpetrator was never apprehended. The fates of the other two followed a similar path.""",1
"""Paynter maintained a decent-sized staff at Croftlands, including six servants and his loyal Chinese body servant Ah Ling,"" Poirot recalled. ""Last Tuesday, Mr. Paynter fell ill after dinner and requested the doctor be summoned. Despite feeling unwell, he insisted on meeting the doctor in his study. The contents of their conversation remained a mystery, however, before leaving, Doctor Quentin requested to speak with the housekeeper and revealed that he had administered medication to Mr. Paynter.""",1
"""Excuse me."" ""Yes?"" ""Well, he was then forced to disguise himself with a fake beard and wig, had to transform back into his own appearance, and sleeping with a fake beard is no simple task as it increases the risk of being discovered! He could not take the chance of still sharing a room with his wife, Mrs. Davenheim. You confirmed my suspicions that for the past six months, or since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, they had been staying in separate rooms. That was the final piece of the puzzle! The gardener who thought he spotted his employer heading towards the side of the house was indeed correct.""",1
"He embraced me tightly, whispering ""Black-haired enchantress"" as he planted kisses on my head, eyes, and lips. ""Time to get down to business,"" he declared, setting me free. ""Fetch the cans of paraffin."" Obeying his command, I watched as he busied himself in the cabin. Soon enough, he appeared on the hut's roof, carrying something in his arms. After a short while, he returned to me. ""Head to the boat. We need to transport it to the other side of the island."" Grabbing the paraffin, he instructed me to vanish. ""They're approaching,"" I warned quietly, noticing a blur emerging from the far shore. He hurried down to me. ""Just in the nick of time. Where the devil is the boat?"" Both vessels had been set adrift.",1
"""At that moment, Japp burst in, his face flushed and sweaty. ""You caught him?"" Poirot asked eagerly. Japp, panting heavily, shook his head. ""Bolitho returned from his vacation this morning, summoned back by a mysterious telegram. The other suspect fled last night. But we'll track him down,"" Japp declared confidently. Poirot, however, disagreed with a solemn expression. ""I doubt it,"" he murmured, absentmindedly etching a large 4 on the table with a fork. Poirot and I frequented a cozy bistro in Soho for dinner. One evening, we spotted Inspector Japp at a nearby table. With an extra seat available, he joined us for a chat, as it had been a while since our last encounter.""",1
"""He must have escaped through the window before we arrived,"" explained the officer. ""Mrs. Havering had me go fetch the police, which was a five-mile walk. They returned with me, and a constable stayed the night. The next morning, a detective from London arrived."" Curious, the inspector inquired about the man who visited Mr. Pace. ""He had a black beard, was middle-aged, and wore a light overcoat,"" the housekeeper recalled. ""Other than his American accent, there wasn't much else that stood out about him.""",1
"As a crime novelist, I have always been intrigued by the complexity of human nature. One day, a mysterious woman approached me with a proposition that could change everything. She spoke in a language that was foreign to me, yet I couldn't help but be drawn in by her enigmatic presence. Despite her worldly-wise exterior, there was a hint of innocence in her eyes that I couldn't ignore. It was as if she was playing a dangerous game, one that I couldn't resist being a part of.",1
"""Such beauty, such tragedy, yet the family remained stoic in their grief."" His eyes bore into mine, causing a flush to rise to my cheeks. Were they truly devastated by sorrow? Was Mrs. Inglethorp's demise truly a source of profound sadness? I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The deceased lacked the ability to inspire love from those around her. While her passing was undoubtedly jarring, it seemed unlikely that she would be deeply mourned. Poirot appeared to sense my unease, offering a solemn nod in agreement.",1
"Strychnine is a potent poison, acting swiftly after ingestion. However, in the case of Mrs. Inglethorp, the symptoms did not appear until the following morning, a significant delay of nine hours. The timing is puzzling, considering she had a light supper and the effects should have been more immediate. This anomaly must not be overlooked and could provide crucial clues during the autopsy. Keep it in mind for now.",1
"""Boris is skilled in getting people to talk,"" declared Tommy confidently, suppressing a discomforting sensation in his gut. ""You won't be able to extract information from me through torture or threats."" Boris raised an eyebrow, intrigued. ""And why is that?"" he inquired. Tommy responded calmly, ""Because you'd be destroying your own source of wealth."" A brief silence followed, during which doubt started to creep in. The man in tattered clothes fixed a penetrating gaze on Tommy. ""Boris, he's playing you,"" he whispered. Tommy's disdain for him grew stronger.",1
"""I was just starting to relax when Suzanne abruptly asked: “What's the opposite?” “The opposite of what?” I replied. “There has to be an opposite. What's the term for skulls that are more than 75% as wide as they are long?” “Brachycephalic,” I reluctantly admitted. “Ah, that's right. I thought I heard you say that.” “Did I? Must have misspoke. I meant dolichocephalic,” I confidently stated. Suzanne stared at me intently. Then she burst out laughing. “You're a good liar, Gipsy girl. But let's cut to the chase, tell me everything now to save time and trouble.”",1
"I was terrified that the woman might spot me as I stood illuminated by the moonlight. In an attempt to retreat, I accidentally caused the old branch to come crashing down, bringing Julius P. Hersheimmer down with it. Tuppence gasped in excitement, urging me to continue. Falling into a soft bed of earth saved me, but left me temporarily incapacitated. When I regained consciousness, I found myself in a hospital bed surrounded by a nurse, a black-bearded man with gold glasses, and a doctor.",1
"No wonder she fainted! Despite her grief and despair, she has resolutely played her part. The anguish must be unbearable. She remains silent, refusing to reveal the true identity of the real murderers. To protect her son, she conceals the fact that Paul Renauld was actually Georges Conneau, the criminal. In a final bitter blow, she publicly admits that Madame Daubreuil was her husband's mistress, risking blackmail to keep her secret safe. She skillfully navigates the questions of the examining magistrate regarding any mysteries in her husband's past life.",1
"Upon the recent publication of the great man's daily schedule, I had pinpointed his whereabouts. He was engrossed in dictating to his secretary in his residence. Knowing that a direct approach would be futile, I devised a clever strategy. By utilizing the Marquis of Loamsley's card, I gained access to Lord Nasby. Despite his initial outburst, I managed to present the details of the Mill House Mystery. Lord Nasby's interest was piqued, and he inquired about brachycephalic heads. Although my findings were deemed thin, I boldly requested a position on his paper to further investigate.",1
"And far in the distance, a glimmer of daylight caught my attention. Growing closer and closer. Lush green foliage appeared before us, which we pushed aside as we made our way through. Once again out in the open, the soft light of dawn painted everything in shades of pink. Poirot's protective barrier was now a tangible presence. Just as we stepped out, three figures pounced on us, only to quickly release us in shock. ""Hurry,"" urged my partner. ""There's no time to waste."" But before he could finish his sentence, the ground began to shake violently beneath us, a deafening roar filling the air as the mountain seemed to crumble before our eyes. We were sent hurtling through the sky. * * * * * Gradually, consciousness returned to me.",1
"""And when did you bring it to Mrs. Inglethorp's room?"" ""Around eight o'clock, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp went to bed before I could finish."" ""So, between seven-fifteen and eight o'clock, the cocoa was on the table in the left wing?"" ""Yes, sir."" Annie's face grew redder and redder, then she suddenly exclaimed: ""And if there was salt in it, sir, it wasn't me. I never brought salt near it."" ""Why do you think there was salt in it?"" Poirot inquired. ""I saw it on the tray, sir."" ""You noticed salt on the tray?"" ""Yes. It appeared to be coarse kitchen salt.""",1
"For a brief moment, she fought to maintain composure, but then, letting go of all restraint, she pressed it against her lips and broke into a torrent of tears. ""Oh, Tommy, Tommy,"" she wailed, ""I adore you so much and yet our paths may never cross again."" After five minutes had passed, Tuppence sat upright, blew her nose, and smoothed down her disheveled hair. ""That's settled,"" she declared firmly. ""Let's confront the truth. It appears that I have developed feelings for a foolish young man who likely holds no regard for me."" She paused briefly.",1
"After a minute or two, he spoke up: ""That's not quite the angle I was considering, Hastings. If just one window had been open, I wouldn't be as intrigued. The fact that both windows are open is what catches my attention."" He quickly moved into the adjacent room. ""The window in the living room is open as well. We had definitely closed that one. Ah!"" He leaned in to inspect the deceased man, scrutinizing the edges of the mouth meticulously. Then, he suddenly looked up. ""He was gagged, Hastings. Gagged and then poisoned."" ""Dear me!"" I cried out, appalled. ""I suppose we'll learn more from the autopsy."" ""We won't learn anything. He died from inhaling potent prussic acid.""",1
"Poirot glanced up at the staircase as he passed by, a look of dissatisfaction on his face. ""It's simply unbelievable that the servants didn't hear anything. The noise from three people coming down those stairs would have been enough to wake the dead!"" ""But it was the dead of night, they were fast asleep by then."" Despite this explanation, Poirot continued to shake his head, clearly not convinced. As he stopped to gaze at the house from the drive, he questioned, ""What made them think to check if the front door was unlocked in the first place? The odds of it being open were slim. It would have been much more logical for them to attempt to break in through a window.""",1
"It was clear that Luigi Valdarno and Miss Elsa Hardt were involved in a complex web of espionage. The mysterious disappearance of Miss Hardt and the sudden death of Valdarno raised suspicions about their true identities. Poirot and I embarked on a risky mission to uncover the truth. As we waited in the shadows, a faint noise alerted us to the presence of an intruder. Poirot's quick thinking and my steady hand led to the capture of the man, who turned out to be an Italian, not a Japanese spy as previously suspected. Our journey to a remote house in St. John's Wood only added to the mystery unfolding before us.",1
"""And the Minister quickly departed. Major Norman and I engaged in casual conversation. Among the cluster of men nearby, I spotted a sly-looking individual conversing with a tall, blonde man. It was none other than Inspector Japp, a familiar face to Poirot and known as one of Scotland Yard's finest. Inspector Japp approached us with a friendly greeting. 'I heard you were involved in this case as well. Quite a clever operation so far. The culprits have managed to evade capture thus far, but I have my doubts about their ability to keep him concealed for much longer.'""",1
"""But all my efforts would have been futile if I had attended. The same goes for those who claim to be 'experts.' Look at the handwriting analysis in the Cavendish Case. One lawyer’s interrogation reveals similarities, while the defense presents evidence of differences. It’s all very technical. And the outcome? Simply confirming what we already suspected. The writing closely resembled that of John Cavendish. And now the mind is left pondering 'Why?' Was it truly his handwriting? Or was someone trying to mislead us? I have unraveled that mystery, my friend, and I have done so accurately."" With that, Poirot, having effectively silenced me, if not entirely convinced, reclined in his chair with an air of contentment.",1
"""Is there anything I can do? A bit of following, maybe, or something like that?"" Tuppence pretended to think, then shook her head. ""Not right now, but I'll keep you in mind, kid. What's this about the girl you mentioned is departing?"" ""Annie? Regular fixture, they had. As Annie put it, servants are someone nowadays, and should be treated as such, and, with her spreading the word, she won't find it as simple to secure another position."" ""Won't she?"" Tuppence mused. ""I wonder..."" An idea was beginning to form in her mind. She pondered for a moment or two, then tapped Albert on the shoulder.",1
"The news hit me like a ton of bricks. Ingles's death reeked of foul play. I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was no accident. It was crystal clear to me that Ingles had fallen victim to the notorious Big Four. As I pondered over the situation, trying to make sense of it all, I was jolted by the peculiar actions of the man across from me. I hadn't really taken notice of him before. He was a gaunt, mysterious figure, with a pale complexion and a neatly trimmed beard. His appearance was so unassuming that I had almost missed his presence.",1
"“Where do you think we should go next?” Tommy asked, trying to sound nonchalant. Miss Prudence Cowley, also known as “Tuppence,” instantly detected the subtle hint of worry in his voice. “You’re broke, aren’t you?” she accused. Tommy attempted to deny it, claiming, “I have plenty of money.” Tuppence shook her head, recalling a past incident where Tommy had convinced someone that beer was a doctor's prescribed tonic. Tommy couldn't help but laugh at the memory.",1
"""Miss Tuppence spoke highly of you, Mr. Beresford,"" he smiled warmly. ""It's as if we've already crossed paths."" Tommy's grin was infectious as he observed the renowned lawyer. Just like with Tuppence, he couldn't help but feel drawn to the man's presence. There was something about him that reminded Tommy of Mr. Carter. Despite their stark physical differences, both men exuded a certain charisma.",1
"I focused solely on my writing."" ""Is there anything else you can share?"" ""No, that's all."" The questioning concluded, but I could sense the Coroner's lingering doubt. He believed Mary Cavendish was withholding information. Amy Hill, a store clerk, was then summoned and confirmed selling a will template to William Earl, the under-gardener at Styles, on the 17th. Following her, William Earl and Manning attested to observing a legal paper.",1
"“John,” I inquired, “I need your opinion on something.” “Go ahead,” he replied. “Do you recall me mentioning my associate Poirot? The distinguished Belgian detective?” “Of course,” John confirmed. “I am considering bringing him in to look into this case,” I explained. “Now? Before the autopsy?” “Yes, time is crucial if foul play is involved.” “Nonsense!” John protested. “I believe Bauerstein is behind this whole mess! Wilkins never suspected a thing until Bauerstein suggested it to him.",1
"As we prepared to call it a night, Sir Guy suddenly grasped Poirot's arm and pointed ahead. Among the tents, a mysterious figure was seen moving in the shadows. It bore a resemblance to the dog-headed entity I had previously observed in the tomb engravings. A chill ran down my spine at the eerie sight. ""Mon Dieu!"" Poirot uttered, making the sign of the cross fervently. ""Anubis, the jackal-headed deity of the afterlife."" Dr. Tosswill abruptly stood up, declaring, ""Someone is playing a prank on us."" Sir Guy, visibly shaken, whispered, ""It entered your tent, Harper,"" his complexion drained of color.",1
"He was sprawled out near a small copse. It seemed he was hunting rooks, a small rifle lay by his side. The bleeding appeared to be sudden. Definitely a gastric ulcer."" ""No indication of a gunshot wound, correct?"" ""Absolutely not!"" ""I apologize,"" Poirot said meekly. ""But, if I recall correctly, in a prior murder case, the doctor initially concluded heart failure but changed it to a gunshot wound after the constable noticed a bullet hole in the head!"" ""There are no bullet wounds on Mr. Smith's body.""",1
"""And how do you propose to assist me?” he inquired. The man produced a business card from his pocket and presented it to her with a slight nod. Tuppence accepted it and examined it closely. The card read, “Mr. Edward Whittington.” Beneath the name were the words “Esthonia Glassware Co.,” along with the address of a downtown office. Mr. Whittington continued, “If you could visit me tomorrow morning at eleven, I will reveal the specifics of my offer.” “Tomorrow at eleven?” Tuppence repeated hesitantly. “Precisely at eleven,” he confirmed. Tuppence reached a decision. “Alright. I'll be there.” “Thank you.",1
"""But who was he?"" Poirot asked. ""The man with the duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who miraculously recovered from severe bronchitis. Yes, that 'stodgy' old man, Mr. Shaw! Sometimes, my friend, criminals lurk in high places. Ah, we have arrived. Mademoiselle, success is mine! May I?"" Poirot beamed as he lightly kissed the astonished girl on both cheeks. Among the many adventures shared with Poirot, one of the most thrilling and dramatic was our investigation into the mysterious deaths following the opening of King Men-her-Ra's Tomb.",1
"I awoke from troubled dreams once more, desperate to find Harry Rayburn and warn him of some unknown danger. As I regained consciousness, memories of the nightmarish ordeal flooded back to me - the hurried escape from the hotel, the mysterious figure in the shadows, and the terrifying sensation of falling. Miraculously, I had survived the ordeal, though I was battered and weak. As I struggled to move, I realized I was confined in a cramped room with walls made of rough wood.",1
"I found myself at the mercy of my captor, an experience reminiscent of the dramatic scenes from “The Perils of Pamela.” The thrilling adventures I had once fantasized about were now unfolding before my eyes, but reality was proving to be far less entertaining. The words of Rayburn echoed in my mind, urging me to tell the truth. But would anyone believe the outlandish tale of how I ended up in this predicament? As I pondered my next move, my captor's menacing grin sent a shiver down my spine. I attempted to maintain a facade of confidence, mentioning my supposed whereabouts to buy some time. However, as the harsh reality of my situation set in, I knew that I was in for a long and arduous night.",1
"“What is he after, this friend of yours?” Tuppence hesitated briefly, but Julius's money held sway, and his concerns took precedence. “He's looking for Jane Finn,” she declared firmly. Mrs. Vandemeyer remained unfazed. “I'm unsure of her current whereabouts,” she responded. “But you could track her down?” “Certainly,” Mrs. Vandemeyer replied nonchalantly. “That wouldn't be a problem.” “Well,” Tuppence's voice quivered slightly, “there's a young man, a friend of mine. I fear something may have happened to him, involving your associate Boris.” “What's his name?” “Tommy Beresford.” “I'm not familiar. But I'll inquire with Boris.”",1
"""Lord Estair, I can only tell you that if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I would have laughed in his face,"" Monsieur Poirot said, keenly observing. ""And today?"" ""Today, I do not know what to think,"" Lord Estair replied, gesturing in despair. Poirot nodded solemnly, glancing at his watch. ""I must have carte blanche, messieurs, in every way. I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose."" ""Absolutely. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard.""",1
"""Indeed! Look who’s here! ‘Watch out, criminals! Hercule Poirot is on the case and let me tell you, ladies, he’s a force to be reckoned with! our beloved society detective won’t let you slip away. Wondering why? Because he’s got the flu himself’!” I chuckled. “Well done, Poirot. You’re really making a name for yourself in the public eye. And luckily, you haven’t missed anything important during this period.” “That’s correct. I didn’t feel any regret turning down the few cases that came my way.” Our landlady appeared at the door. “There’s a man downstairs. Insists on speaking with Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain.",1
"Despite my concerns for young Willard, the Anubis figure you witnessed last night was actually Hassan disguised at my request. I orchestrated the charade to test the doctor's nerves, but it was clear that he saw through my feigned belief in the supernatural. The performance I put on failed to dupe him. I had a hunch that he would try to target me next. Despite the cursed sea, the oppressive heat, and the sand's irritations, my keen intellect remained sharp. Poirot's instincts were spot on.",1
"The chauffeur glanced around, awaiting instructions. “Rotate the car first, George. Then sound the bell, and return to your spot. Keep the engine running, and prepare to bolt when I signal.” “Understood, sir.” The butler opened the front door. Kramenin felt the cold steel of the revolver pressed against his side. “Now,” Julius whispered. “And proceed cautiously.” The Russian gestured. His face was pale, and his voice quivered slightly: “I am Kramenin! Bring the girl down immediately! Time is of the essence!” Whittington descended the stairs. He gasped in surprise upon seeing the newcomer.",1
"""Do I detect a Boche in the midst? Or simply an American millionaire with a less-than-ideal lineage? Regardless, we shall pay a visit at noon. It’s a prime time that often results in complimentary meals for two.” Tuppence silently agreed. “Now onto Carter. Time is of the essence.” Carshalton Terrace boasted an impeccable line of what Tuppence described as “elegant homes.” They pressed the doorbell at No. 27, and a tidy maid opened the door. She appeared so proper that Tuppence felt a sense of dread. In response to Tommy’s inquiry for Mr. Carter, she ushered them into a cozy study on the lower level before excusing herself.",1
"I never fooled myself into thinking that it held any significance. It was likely just a passing fancy. Nevertheless, I had the ability to intrigue her. She was a woman who had encountered the typical thrills of life. I intended to introduce her to an exceptional one! I admired her; admired her relaxed demeanor, her absence of emotional exaggeration, her sincerity. I was determined. I resolved to find her at that moment. She probably hadn't retired for the night. But then I realized that I was unaware of her cabin number.",1
"""His words seemed to lack clarity, filling me with uneasiness. However, his demeanor was that of normalcy. Abruptly, he got up and casually walked over to the window. ""There he is,"" he remarked. ""Who?"" I inquired. ""M. Jack Renauld. I sent a message to the Villa requesting his presence here."" This revelation shifted my thoughts, prompting me to question Poirot about Jack Renauld's presence in Merlinville on the night of the crime. Hoping to outsmart my clever companion, I was disappointed to find that he was already aware. Just like me, he had checked at the station. ""It seems we are not the only ones with this idea, Hastings. The admirable Giraud has likely done the same.""",1
"I was in the middle of a conversation with him about the shocking events of that day - the failed assassination attempt on Mr. David MacAdam, the Prime Minister of England. The newspapers had little information, only mentioning that the Prime Minister narrowly avoided the bullet. It was clear that our law enforcement had been negligent for such a serious incident to occur. I couldn't help but think that German spies operating in England would go to great lengths to pull off such a bold move.",1
"Suddenly, a loud exclamation escaped his lips. ""What's this?"" His eyes widened in surprise as he peered into the nearly empty chest. At the bottom, nestled amongst the other items, was a striking black beard. Poirot let out a quiet ""Oh!"" as he carefully picked it up for closer inspection. ""Brand new,"" he observed. With a moment of contemplation, he placed it back in the chest, concealed it under the rest of the contents, and descended the stairs with purpose. Upon entering the pantry, he greeted Dorcas who was diligently cleaning her silverware. After expressing his gratitude for her earlier tip about the chest, Poirot continued on his way.",1
"Suzanne's enthusiasm was lacking, having traveled extensively. She was not one to get excited before breakfast. When I expressed my excitement at spotting a giant blue convolvulus, she snubbed me harshly. Just to clarify, this story will not be set in South Africa. I won't promise any authentic local color with italicized words on every page. While I admire it, I simply cannot replicate it. In the South Sea Islands, however, a mention of bêche-de-mer is always appropriate.",1
"""John, I believe, would have probed deeper, but suddenly the loud hum of an engine caught our attention, and we all glanced towards the window as it whizzed by. “Evie!” John exclaimed. “Excuse me, Wells.” He quickly exited into the hallway. Poirot turned to me questioningly. “Miss Howard,” I clarified. “Ah, I am relieved she has arrived. She is a woman of both intellect and compassion, Hastings. Despite lacking in physical beauty!” I mimicked John’s actions and joined him in the hallway, where Miss Howard was struggling to free herself from the bulky layers of veils covering her head.""",1
"I caught my breath at the sight before me, a hunger for the unknown swelling inside. The Kilmorden drew closer, like a dream. Another figure appeared, familiar yet distant after the events of the previous night. His warning of danger lingered, leaving me unsettled. As we parted ways, his footsteps echoing, I knew our paths would not cross again. The next hours were a blur of bureaucracy and relief, until I found myself at the Mount Nelson, surrounded by sunshine and flowers. Suzanne's indifference contrasted with my excitement, but I reveled in the beauty around me. This is not a story of South Africa, with no promise of local color. My inability to provide italics of authenticity is clear, but the essence of the tale remains.",1
"She can type, I know, for she mentioned it once. To my surprise, Pagett strongly opposed the idea. He has a deep dislike for Anne Beddingfeld, especially since the incident with the black eye. Pagett's behavior is quite mysterious these days. Just to provoke him, I will inquire with the girl. As I mentioned earlier, she has exceptionally attractive legs. (Continuation of Anne's Story) I doubt I will ever forget my initial view of Table Mountain for as long as I live. I woke up incredibly early and stepped out onto the deck.",1
"A nervous wreck, poor thing. I've done what I could to shield her, but the shock was inevitable."" ""You were treating Mr. Maltravers recently?"" ""My dear sir, I never treated him."" ""What?"" ""I believe Mr. Maltravers followed Christian Science or a similar belief."" ""But you conducted the examination?"" ""Indeed. I was summoned by a gardener."" ""And the cause of death was evident?"" ""Undoubtedly. Blood on the lips, but the majority of bleeding internally."" ""Was the body left undisturbed?"" ""Yes, untouched from where it was discovered.""",1
"""I believed they were feasible?"" ""Absolutely feasible. I've been delving into gamma rays from Radium C., a byproduct of Radium emanation, and stumbled upon intriguing magnetic occurrences. I even have a hypothesis on the true essence of magnetism, but it's not yet the right moment to reveal my findings. Sir.""",1
"""Then it’s off!” Tuppence rose. “It’s both or neither. Sorry but that’s how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.” “Wait a minute. Let us see if something can’t be managed. Sit down again, Miss ” He paused interrogatively. Tuppence’s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her head. “Jane Finn,” she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the effect of those two simple words. All the geniality had faded out of Whittington’s face. It was purple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay.",1
"At the stroke of eleven, a telegram arrived from Poirot: ""Instruct Japp to detain housekeeper at once."" I was shocked, but wasted no time in delivering the message to Japp. He muttered a curse, acknowledging Poirot's reputation. ""If he insists, there must be a reason. I barely gave the woman a second thought. I may not arrest her, but she will be closely monitored. Let's head up there now and conduct a thorough search."" Unfortunately, it was already too late. Mrs. Middleton, the unassuming middle-aged housekeeper who had seemed so ordinary, had vanished without a trace. Only her abandoned belongings remained.",1
"""Once again, there was no witness to the mysterious entry into the apartment while we were away, and the whereabouts of our deceased companion, Mayerling, remain a mystery.... ""No clues left behind by Number Four, he is well aware of that. His initial visit was merely a reconnaissance mission. It is possible he sought confirmation of Mayerling's demise, but more likely, he came to confront Hercule Poirot, the only adversary he truly fears."" Poirot's logic seemed self-centered to me, but I chose not to challenge it. ""What is the latest on the investigation?"" I inquired.",1
"""Back in the day, men and women were equals. Papa used to say they roamed the world together like lions and tigers,"" Colonel Race chimed in with a smirk, ""And giraffes?"" I couldn't help but laugh at the mention of giraffes. ""Yes, giraffes too. They were nomads, you know. It wasn't until they settled in communities that women's strength waned. Deep down, we're all the same. Women still admire physical strength in men because it's what they once possessed and now lack.""",1
"“And he will be able, at his leisure, to return and obliterate this lone piece of evidence that incriminates him.” “So, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom the whole time, right under our noses?” I exclaimed. Poirot nodded. “Indeed, my dear friend. That is where I found the crucial ‘last link,’ and I am indebted to you for that very fortunate discovery.” “To me?” “Yes. Remember when you pointed out that my hand trembled while I was arranging the ornaments on the mantelpiece?” “Yes, but I fail to see the significance.” “No, but I did. You see, my friend, I recalled that earlier that morning, when we were there together, I had rearranged all the objects on the mantelpiece.",1
"I could not help but feel unsettled by the encounter with Marthe and Jack Renauld. Their whispered conversation hinted at hidden fears and secrets, leaving me with more questions than answers. As I walked away from the scene, my attention was caught by a peculiar sight near the hedge. What appeared to be a bush turned out to be Giraud, the detective, signaling for silence. With a stern expression, he chastised me for interrupting their conversation, revealing his true intentions. Our encounter left me even more curious about the mysteries surrounding the young couple and the tragic events that seemed to bind them together.",1
"""“Why did you do it?” The nobleman demanded, his voice filled with confusion. Poirot remained calm as he responded, “I simply wanted to force a resolution.” Lord Yardly was taken aback, exclaiming, “To force a resolution! Dear God!” Poirot continued cheerfully, “And the plan worked, my lord. Therefore, I am pleased to return this to you.” With a grand gesture, he revealed a dazzling diamond. “The prized Star of the East,” Lord Yardly whispered in awe. “But I am at a loss for words.” “No matter,” Poirot replied. “Rest assured, the diamond is safe with you. It was necessary for it to be taken. I promised its protection, and I have upheld my promise.""",1
"Yes, I was content, yet there lingered a sense of anticipation, as if something awaited me on the horizon. Restlessness tingled beneath my skin. Following our tea, we meandered outside, boarded the tram, and were guided by jovial attendants along the narrow rails to the bridge. The grandeur of the scene unfolded before us - the vast gorge, the tumultuous waters below, and the misty shroud that occasionally parted to reveal the majestic waterfall, only to quickly conceal it once more in enigmatic secrecy. This, I concluded, is the allure of the Falls - their enigmatic nature.",1
"He raged against the porters, the waiters at breakfast, the entire hotel staff. He probably wanted to unleash his fury on Miss Pettigrew too, but even Sir Eustace wouldn't dare. She was like a character straight out of a novel, always with her pencil and pad ready. I barely managed to save our giraffe from his wrath. Sir Eustace seemed ready to crush him. As for our mission, once Sir Eustace withdrew, Miss Pettigrew volunteered to stay behind just in case he needed her.",1
"We proceeded to our destination, a prime target in the affluent northern suburbs of London. Upon arrival at a grand and imposing house set back from the main road, Norman and I remained by the car while Poirot and a detective approached the entrance and pressed the doorbell. A poised parlourmaid answered the door, only to be met with the detective's authoritative declaration of their intent to search the premises. The maid let out a gasp, prompting a sophisticated, mature woman to emerge from the shadows of the hallway. ""Quick, Edith, close the door. These must be intruders,"" she exclaimed. Without hesitation, Poirot wedged his foot in the doorway and blew a sharp blast on a whistle.",1
"""They are merely new acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t suspect for a moment” Poirot gestured with his hand. “Hold on, my friend. Have I made any assumptions? All I am saying is it's an intriguing tale. And there is no clue to unravel it; except maybe the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said firmly, “but I fail to see” Poirot cut me off with a hearty laugh. Something appeared to be greatly amusing him. “And Stella means a star, correct? Brilliant!” “What in the world” “And stars provide illumination! There you have it! Relax, Hastings. Spare me the wounded pride. Come, let us head to Montagu Mansions and conduct a few investigations.""",1
"Papa’s friends were all renowned Professors, distinguished by their long beards. One of them, Professor Peterson, once made a rather inappropriate comment about Anne's figure. Anne, yearning for adventure and romance, found solace in the village's lending library and the weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela” at the Kinema. Her father's sudden excitement over an antique skull found in Northern Rhodesia sparked a new adventure. Unfortunately, Papa's health took a turn for the worse, and he passed away, leaving Anne practically penniless. Mr. Flemming, Papa's solicitor, offered Anne a temporary stay in London, setting the stage for new beginnings and unexpected challenges.",1
"He grabbed Albert's shoulder, pointing towards the house. ""Keep an eye on that window when I start singing,"" he instructed before retreating to the main drive. With a deep voice and unsteady steps, Tommy belted out the familiar tune: I'm a jolly British Soldier, you can tell by my feet! The song had been a comfort to Tuppence during her days in the hospital. Despite his lack of musical talent, Tommy's strong lungs carried the melody with determination.",1
"I glanced over the list of names, my heart pounding in anticipation. The first one jumped out at me - Ernest Luttrell. The son of a North Country parson, with a troubled past. Expelled from school, turned to the stage. A man with a kink in his moral make-up, addicted to drugs. Disappeared to Australia four years ago, leaving no trace behind. Age 32, 5 ft. 10-1/2 in., clean-shaven, brown hair, straight nose, fair complexion, gray eyes. The pieces of the puzzle were finally starting to come together.",1
"Poirot and Japp were discussing the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Davenheim. Japp revealed that they found Mr. Davenheim's clothes near the lake, but not his body. They also arrested a suspect named Lowen, who was seen near the study on the day of the disappearance. Additionally, a man named Billy Kellett pawned Mr. Davenheim's ring in London. Poirot doubted that Lowen was the murderer, citing lack of evidence. He suggested that the ring may have been removed from the body to divert suspicion. Japp mentioned a lime kiln near the lake where the body could have been disposed of. Poirot then made a startling revelation about Mr. Davenheim's true whereabouts, leaving everyone in shock.",1
"""True, I guess so.” “Bauerstein is quite the genius. A leading figure in the field of toxicology, isn't he?” “Absolutely,” replied John, a hint of unease in his voice. Then, after a pause, he asked tentatively: “Will all of us need to testify, I mean?” “You, definitely and um Mr. um Inglethorp.” There was a brief silence before the attorney continued in a calming tone: “Any additional evidence will merely be corroborative, a mere formality.” “Got it.” A sense of relief washed over John's face. It struck me as odd, as I didn't see any reason for it. “If you have no objections,” Mr. pursued.",1
"Carter nodded. Holding a sheet of paper, he read out loud: “Hurry to Astley Priors, Gatehouse, Kent. Big changes TOMMY.” Sir James remarked, “It's quite straightforward, yet quite clever. All it took was a few adjustments to deceive. But there was one crucial detail they missed.” “And what was that?” “The page-boy’s account of Miss Cowley heading to Charing Cross. They were overly confident in their scheme, assuming he had erred.”",1
"""The meticulous examination of fingerprints and footprints, cigarette ash, various soil types, and other evidentiary traces is undeniably crucial."" ""Absolutely. I have never disputed that. The seasoned observer, the specialist, undoubtedly they are valuable! However, the likes of Hercules Poirot, they transcend the specialists! They are presented with the evidence by the experts, their concern is the crime's methodology, its reasoned inference, the correct arrangement and organization of the evidence; most importantly, the genuine psychological understanding of the situation.""",1
"He walked past us without acknowledging our presence, his lean, bronzed face hinting at a life spent in tropical regions. Poirot quickly approached a gardener for information about the man, who had stayed at the house the previous week. Mrs. Maltravers was shocked to see him, as he had cancelled his trip to East Africa due to unexpected news of inheritance. Poirot suspected foul play and engaged in a subtle interrogation to uncover the truth. As the mystery unfolded, it became clear that appearances could be deceiving and things were not as they seemed.",1
"""Most of them are Mrs. or Miss.” Tommy nodded. “That adds a layer of complexity,” he said thoughtfully. Tuppence, with her characteristic “terrier” shake, responded, “Well, we must simply tackle it head-on. Let’s begin with the London area. Jot down the addresses of any females residing in London or nearby, while I grab my hat.” A short while later, the young couple walked out onto Piccadilly, and moments later, a taxi whisked them away to The Laurels, Glendower Road, N.7, the home of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose name was at the top of a list of seven in Tommy’s notebook.""",1
"He grasped my arm tightly. ""I've made a fool of myself, my dear friend! I could hear the love and sorrow in her voice, my little theory was completely off. Well, I must rethink everything!"" The doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman inside. The police inspector watched them, sighing. ""Poor woman,"" he muttered. ""The trauma was too overwhelming for her. There's nothing we can do now. Shall we go to the crime scene, M. Poirot?"" ""Yes, let's, M. Bex."" We made our way through the house and exited through the front entrance.",1
"""She rushed off in a taxi to Charing Cross after receiving a telegram."" His attention was drawn to the letter in Julius's possession. ""Oh, she left a note for you. That's fine. Where did she go?"" Without thinking, he reached out for the letter, but Julius folded it and put it away, appearing slightly uneasy. ""I suppose this isn't relevant. It pertains to something else, something I inquired about and she was supposed to inform me."" ""Oh!"" Tommy looked perplexed, anticipating more details. ""Listen,"" Julius interjected, ""I should inform you. I proposed to Miss Tuppence this morning.""",1
"Chichester and Mr. Pagett. ""You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that sailors are the nicest to women. My purser came to the rescue magnificently. He confidently approached, clarified that No. 17 was my cabin, and offered them Nos. 13 and 28 or the option to stay put. I expressed my gratitude with a glance and settled into my new quarters. The incident lifted my spirits. The sea was calm, the temperature rising. Seasickness was a thing of the past! I ventured onto the deck and learned the game of deck-quoits. I signed up for various sports events.",1
"I briefly considered taking charge myself, relishing the opportunity to outsmart Poirot. However, I resisted the urge, knowing I couldn't risk jeopardizing our mission by acting alone. This was a critical operation - we had finally gained an advantage over our adversaries. It was essential that we capitalize on this moment. As much as I hated to admit it, Poirot's intellect surpassed my own. I quickly penned a letter to him, detailing the situation and stressing the importance of eavesdropping on the upcoming meeting.",1
"""Jewel thefts, counterfeiting, espionage (especially lucrative in times of conflict), acts of sabotage, discreet murders - there is barely a crime he hasn't dabbled in. Cleverest of all, he knows exactly when to step back. Things start to get risky? He bows out gracefully with a hefty sum of money!"" ""Hm,"" the Count responded with uncertainty. ""It's rather disconcerting for all of us. We're left in limbo, so to speak."" ""But we're being compensated generously!"" Her tone carried a hint of sarcasm, prompting the man to give her a sharp look. She was grinning to herself, and the nature of her grin piqued his interest.",1
"I knew they would eventually show up at the residence in Soho. I used the gun to intimidate Julius, hoping Tuppence would relay the message to Sir James so he wouldn't fret about us. Once the girls disappeared from view, I instructed Julius to speed towards London, recounting the entire ordeal along the way. Upon arriving at the Soho residence, we encountered Mr. Carter outside. After finalizing details with him, we entered and concealed ourselves behind the curtain in the alcove. The officers were under strict instructions to deny any knowledge of anyone entering the house if questioned. That's the gist of it.",1
"Templeton, a charming residence with amiable inhabitants. Mrs. Templeton, the youthful wife, stands in stark contrast to her older husband, who has a son from a previous marriage residing with them. The dynamic between the step-mother and the son appears strained, with the son displaying a lack of normalcy in his intellect. The mysterious nature of Mr. Templeton's illness is evident, with sporadic gastric attacks causing pain and vomiting. Despite my suspicions, the doctor's assurance left me with no room to voice my concerns.",1
"""Poirot's comments on the underexposed interiors were unnecessary, showing his jealousy of my position on the case. His request for clothing details seemed ridiculous, but I complied. When Poirot advised Japp to arrest the housekeeper, it was too late. Mrs. Middleton had vanished, leaving behind only ordinary clothes. Mrs. Havering hired her from Selbourne's Agency, but they had no record of her. The mystery deepened as we realized she must have had a connection to the murder. Poirot instructed us to find out what vehicle took her to Hunter's Lodge. The local garage had no record of her using their services. Mrs. Havering had given her money for transportation, but none of the available options were used.""",1
"I meekly agreed to his request for company, though apprehensive of the consequences. Before his departure, I inquired about his name, to which he casually replied, ""Harry Rayburn."" The sudden onset of seasickness during the journey left me incapacitated and indifferent to my original mission. However, a kind gesture from Mrs. Flemming led to a change in plans, as I decided to embark on a new adventure in South Africa. With a generous parting gift in hand, I set out on my journey, eventually finding some solace on deck and observing the intriguing passengers around me. The arrival in Madeira brought a glimmer of hope, as the scent of violets lifted my spirits and made me consider enduring the remainder of the voyage.",1
"As my rescuer turned towards me, a sense of urgency emanated from him. ""You're injured!"" His voice held a hint of danger towards whoever had caused me harm. In that instant, I recognized him - the man with the scar. But before he could react, our fallen adversary had already bolted up and fled. Rayburn cursed as he pursued the enemy, leaving me behind. Feeling left out, I reluctantly joined the pursuit, lagging behind. We raced around the deck, finally reaching the starboard side of the ship.",1
"""Miss Pettigrew."" ""He wasn't exactly singing her praises just now,"" I observed. Pagett gave me a cold stare. ""She's a skilled shorthand typist,"" he stated firmly. As we arrived at the station, I thought he would depart. Extending my hand, I was surprised when he declined. ""I'll accompany you to see you off. It's only eight o'clock, your train departs in fifteen minutes."" Efficiently, he directed the porters. I stood frozen, avoiding eye contact with Suzanne. The man was suspicious. He was intent on ensuring that I caught the train.",1
"He was a villain, but a pleasant one. Sir Eustace's escape was not surprising. Colonel Race knew his real name was Harry Lucas, but he was actually John Harold Eardsley. Harry deceived Anne, but eventually confessed the truth to her. Anne realized the discrepancies in his story and struggled with her feelings towards him. Harry wanted to live a simple life with Anne, away from his father's wealth. In the end, he revealed his true identity to Anne, feeling jealous of Colonel Race.",1
"Reflecting on the conversation, I couldn't shake the feeling of dissatisfaction. A sudden urge to track down Bauerstein in the village consumed me - someone needed to keep a close watch on him. However, I knew it was crucial to avoid raising any suspicions about his potential involvement. Recalling Poirot's trust in my diplomatic skills, I made my way to the small house where Bauerstein was staying, discreetly tapping on the door. It swung open to reveal an elderly woman peering back at me.",1
"Unbeknownst to me, I found a twisted satisfaction in witnessing her collapse. It revealed a vulnerability that I had failed to see before. She was, after all, just a young girl, her actions driven by thoughtless curiosity. ""I did try to warn you,"" I spoke softly. ""I suppose you did. Farewell."" ""Wait, you can't venture out alone in this state. It's too dangerous. I must escort you back to Merlinville."" ""Don't be absurd. I'm perfectly fine now."" ""What if you fall ill again? No, I will not let you go alone."" She fiercely argued against my proposition, her determination shining through.",1
"As we stepped into the vast hall, John motioned for us to follow him into the lounge. It was clear from his expression that something unsettling had transpired. We walked in behind him, and he closed the door quietly. ""Mary, we have a bit of a situation on our hands. Evie and Alfred Inglethorp had a falling out, and she's left."" ""Evie? Left?"" John confirmed with a solemn nod. ""Yes, she turned to the mater, and Oh, look who's here now, Evie herself."" Miss Howard made her entrance. Her mouth was a tight line, and she held a small bag. She seemed agitated and resolute, with a hint of defensiveness. ""In any case,"" she exclaimed, ""I've said my piece!"" ""Evelyn, dear,"" Mrs.",1
"""Look who we have here, Mr. McNeil!"" exclaimed Poirot. ""Miss - um, Monro, thank you for coming to share some information with us."" Poirot greeted the lady warmly, comparing her to a blooming flower in the dull office. Miss Monro blushed at his flattering words. ""You Frenchmen are all the same,"" she giggled.",1
"After returning to the road, I found the waiting car and drove away. While on the train, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. A man across from me winked at a woman nearby, sending chills down my spine. Relieved that the papers were safe, I stepped into the corridor for some fresh air, considering changing carriages. However, the woman stopped me, claiming I had dropped something. As I bent down to check, everything went black. The next thing I knew, I was waking up in the hospital, a sharp pain at the back of my head.",1
"As he spoke, he flung the door wide and we stepped inside. The chamber M. Renauld had designated as his personal sanctuary was compact, yet adorned with exquisite elegance. A practical writing desk, complete with numerous compartments, occupied the corner by the window. Across from the fireplace, two expansive armchairs clad in leather beckoned, encircling a circular table adorned with the newest publications. Rows of books adorned the walls, while a splendid oak sideboard with a tantalus graced the far end of the room.",1
"""She triumphantly pulled it out from the pocket of her sweater. The sudden tilt of the boat caused her to lose her balance, and in her attempt to steady herself by grabbing the rail, the roll of films slipped over the side. Mrs. Blair exclaimed, 'Oh!' in a comical display of dismay. Peering over the edge, she asked, 'Do you think they've gone overboard?' 'No, you might have been lucky enough to accidentally hit an unfortunate steward on the deck below.' Unnoticed, a young boy standing a few steps behind us blew a loud blast on a bugle. 'Lunch time!' Mrs. Blair announced with excitement. 'I haven't eaten since breakfast, except for two cups of beef-tea. Are you joining me for lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?' 'Well,' I hesitated.""",1
"""It could be a mere accident that someone tried to poison him on the same night. But could it really be just a coincidence?"" ""You seem to lean more towards the idea of murder."" ""And what about you?"" ""My friend, our thought processes differ. I am not inclined to choose between murder and accident just yet. That decision will only come once we have unraveled the bigger mystery at hand - the enigma of the 'Golden Orchid.' Oh, and you missed something there."" ""Are you referring to the two faintly indicated lines intersecting at right angles beneath the text? I initially dismissed them as insignificant.""",1
"The Coroner fixed Inglethorp with a stern gaze. ""You need to reconsider,"" he demanded. Inglethorp simply shook his head. ""I'm drawing a blank. I think I was out for a walk."" ""Which way did you go?"" ""I honestly can't recall."" The Coroner's expression darkened. ""Were you alone?"" ""Yes."" ""Did you encounter anyone during your walk?"" ""No."" ""Well, that's unfortunate,"" the Coroner remarked sarcastically. ""So, am I to understand that you refuse to disclose your whereabouts when Mr. Mace claims he saw you buying strychnine at the store?"" ""If that's how you want to interpret it, then yes."" ""Be cautious, Mr. Inglethorp."" Poirot squirmed anxiously. ""Mon Dieu!"" he whispered.",1
"""I think it's one of the most exquisite necklaces in the world, the pearls are perfectly matched and the color is flawless. I really need to go and fetch it!"" ""Oh, madame,"" objected Poirot, ""you are too kind. Please don't trouble yourself!"" ""But I want to share it with you."" The plump woman hurried over to the elevator. Her husband, who had been conversing with me, glanced at Poirot with curiosity. ""Your wife is so kind to want to show me her pearl necklace,"" Poirot clarified. ""Ah, the pearls!"" Opalsen grinned contentedly.",1
"I wanted to go to the Magnificent right away to inform Miss Marvell about what had happened, however Poirot rejected the idea, saying that the next morning would be more suitable. I reluctantly agreed. The following morning, Poirot appeared hesitant to leave the house. I started to think that maybe he was reluctant to continue with the investigation after realizing his initial mistake. When I tried to persuade him, he logically pointed out that since the details of the Yardly Chase incident were already in the morning newspapers, the Rolfs would be as informed as we were. I reluctantly conceded.",1
"""You monster! I can't believe you would stoop so low."" ""Would you like me to remind you of some of his tactics?""

""I won't do it."" ""Your arguments are pointless, just do it."" ""And if I refuse?"" ""Your wife will be released. I'll send the message right away."" ""How can I trust that you'll keep your word?"" ""I promise on the graves of my ancestors. Besides, think about it, why would I want to harm her? Keeping her captive has served its purpose.",1
"Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",1

I asked, noticing the seriousness in his expression. ""Sharks?"" ""No, dear Anne. Sharks are creatures of the sea. But you're clever to think of that. It's crocs we need to worry about."" ""Crocodiles?"" ""Exactly. Try not to think about them or pray, whichever you prefer."" And with that, we dove into the water.",1
"""I am not sure,"" the boy replied. The table in front of him was cluttered with various items that he absentmindedly played with. Inspector Giraud demanded a response from him, addressing him as M. Renauld. In frustration, the boy angrily knocked a heavy paper-knife off the table. ""Fine, you want to know? Yes, I fought with my father. I probably said all those horrible things you mentioned. I was so mad, I can't even recall my exact words! I was beyond furious - I felt like I could have done something terrible in that moment. Happy now?"" The boy leaned back in his seat, looking flushed and unapologetic.",1
"“Did he seem confused when you brought it up?” “Completely. He had no clue what I was talking about.” I had anticipated Poirot's disappointment, but he surprisingly expressed relief. My ego prevented me from probing further. Poirot changed the subject. “Cynthia wasn't at lunch today? Any reason why?” “She's back at the hospital. Resumed her duties today.” “She's a hardworking young lady. And quite lovely. Reminds me of paintings from my time in Italy. I'd love to visit her dispensary. Think she'd allow it?” “I'm sure she'd be thrilled to show you around.”",1
"""She exited the room and reappeared holding it firmly in her hand. The revolver never left her grasp, making it clear that Achille Poirot's ability to deceive her was slim. Countess Vera Rossakoff was no fool. ""Open it, madame. The left flap. That's it. Now remove the photograph and examine it."" With curiosity, she pulled out what appeared to be a small snapshot. As soon as she looked at it, she cried out and staggered as if she might collapse. Then she lunged towards my partner. ""Where is it? Where? You must tell me. Where?"" ""Remember our deal, madame."" ""Yes, yes, I will trust you.""",1
"""I'm not withholding any information. You have all the facts at your disposal to make your own conclusions. This case is all about theories."" ""Nevertheless, I'm curious to find out."" Poirot gazed at me intently, shaking his head once more. ""You lack instincts,"" he said sadly. ""But earlier you mentioned intelligence,"" I reminded him. ""Intelligence and instincts are frequently intertwined,"" Poirot cryptically replied. The comment appeared so out of place that I chose not to respond.",1
"""Without the money, she's as silent as a tomb. You can count on it!"" This statement made sense to Tuppence, who found some solace in it. ""You're right,"" Sir James pondered. ""I do wish we hadn't interrupted when we did. But there's no going back now. We'll just have to wait until morning."" Turning to Mrs. Vandemeyer's motionless form on the bed, he sighed. ""Oh well,"" Tuppence tried to sound optimistic, ""looks like we'll just have to be patient until morning comes.""",1
"""Ah, you were correct!"" ""Oh Boris, can't you take a joke?"" ""Was it truly a joke?"" ""Indeed."" ""Well, your sense of humor is quite unique, my dear Rita."" Mrs. Vandemeyer grinned. ""Let's not argue, Boris. Ring the bell. Drinks are in order."" Tuppence quickly left the room. She stopped briefly to check her reflection in Mrs. Vandemeyer's full-length mirror, ensuring her appearance was flawless. Then she responded to the bell with a demure smile.",1
""" The young man shook his head vigorously, and the judge, always eager to challenge Giraud, responded. “Not now. M. Bex will kindly bring it to us here.” The police commissioner exited the room. Stonor approached Jack, shaking his hand. Poirot stood up and straightened a pair of candlesticks that caught his attention. The judge re-read the mysterious love letter, holding onto his theory of jealousy and betrayal. Suddenly, the door swung open and the commissioner hurried in. “Judge! Judge!” “Yes.""",1
"“Did you receive my message? Please, have a seat and provide me with any details you have regarding my relative.” “Relative? Who are you referring to?” “I'm talking about Jane Finn.” “Jane Finn is your cousin?” “Yes, her mother and my father were siblings,” Mr. Hersheimmer clarified. “Oh!” exclaimed Tuppence. “Do you know her whereabouts?” “No!” Mr. Hersheimmer slammed his fist on the table. “I have no idea! Do you?” “We posted advertisements seeking information, not giving it,” Tuppence reminded sternly. “I am well aware of that. I am literate.”",1
"“Well, there's always Sir Eustace Pedler’s property,” the man hesitated. “The Mill House, you're familiar with it.” “Not exactly where,” I stumbled. (Honestly, stumbling is becoming my forte.) “That's right! The scene of the crime. But maybe you wouldn't be interested.”“Oh, I don't believe I'd be bothered,” I responded with a show of confidence. I believed my credibility was now firmly established. “And maybe I could snag a deal under the circumstances.” A stroke of genius, in my opinion. “Well, it's a possibility. Letting it out won't be easy now with servants and all that, you understand.”",1
"""The disappearance of the will, and her carrying its secret to her grave. Cavendish, I am afraid there is more to it than meets the eye. Monsieur Poirot, I believe you will concur that the evidence is quite telling.” “Telling, or not,” John interjected, “we owe Monsieur Poirot a debt of gratitude for clarifying the situation. Without him, we would never have been aware of the existence of this will. May I inquire, monsieur, what initially aroused your suspicions?” Poirot smiled and replied: “An envelope covered in scribbles, and a freshly cultivated patch of begonias.""",1
"""The inquiry won't happen until Friday."" ""Friday, my foot!"" Miss Howard let out a disdainful snort. ""You're all out of your minds. The man will have left the country by then. If he has any sense, he won't stick around here quietly waiting to be arrested."" John Cavendish looked at her with a sense of defeat. ""I see what's going on,"" she accused him, ""you've been heeding the advice of the physicians. Never a good idea. What do they really know? Absolutely nothing or just enough to be a threat. I should know, my own father was a doctor. That Wilkins is perhaps the biggest imbecile I've ever come across. Heart attack! The kind of diagnosis he would give.""",1
"""The two detectives shifted in their seats. I noticed the official warning “Anything you say can and will be used against you,” practically ready to spill from Summerhaye’s mouth. Poirot pressed on. “Are you comprehending now, sir?” “No. What are you insinuating?” “I am insinuating,” Poirot stated deliberately, “that you are under suspicion for poisoning your wife.” A collective gasp rippled through the room at this blunt accusation. “Heavens above!” exclaimed Inglethorp, leaping to his feet. “What an absurd notion! Poisoning my beloved Emily!” “I don’t believe” Poirot observed him intently “that you fully grasp the damning weight of your testimony from the inquest.""",1
"“Absolutely nothing. I’m terrible at dealing with business matters.” “I see. So you have no idea why he suddenly decided to take out a life insurance policy? He hadn’t done so before, is that correct?” “We had only been married for a little over a year. But the reason he got the life insurance was because he was convinced that he wouldn’t live much longer. He had a strong feeling that his death was near. He had already suffered from a hemorrhage, and he believed that another one would be fatal. I tried to reassure him, but he was convinced of his impending death.”",1
"""I was."" As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. ""You didn't help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?"" I replied coldly, ""M. Poirot has gone to Paris. And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police."" Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. ""They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better.""",1
"I noticed my pencil resting against the closed cupboard door. It struck me that had the door been open, my pencil would have surely found its way inside. Intrigued, I opened the door, allowing the pencil to escape into the shadows of the far corner. As I reached for it, I realized that the dim light and odd structure of the cupboard made it nearly impossible to spot the pencil without touch. Satisfied with the retrieval, I decided to check the cupboard beneath the window on the other side of the room.",1
"""I won't be long,"" I said in a drowsy state as the landlady informed me of a visitor. Lady Yardly, a well-known figure, entered and we discussed the mysterious blackmail letters regarding a diamond. Lady Yardly revealed that her letters came by post and had an Eastern scent, similar to Miss Marvell's. We tried to make sense of the situation but couldn't. Lady Yardly decided to leave, leaving me to inform Poirot. He returned and was intrigued by the case, deciding to involve Lord Yardly. Poirot believed the diamond was in danger of being stolen, but didn't elaborate. Lord Yardly arrived, puzzled by the situation.",1
"The room was crowded, with patrons searching for an empty table amid snippets of conversation. ""She started crying when I told her the flat was no longer available,"" one voice mentioned. ""It was a steal, just like Mabel Lewis' purchase from Paris,"" chimed in another. Tommy remarked on the random bits of talk they overheard, including a discussion about someone named Jane Finn. As two elderly women left their seats, Tuppence quickly settled into one. Tommy then placed an order for tea and pastries.",1

Beddingfeld wants glory of discovery. Mrs. Blair welcomes idea of murder as scoop for Anne. Tomorrow passing through Bechuanaland.",1
"Miss Marvell leaned forward, revealing a stone of white fire in her palm. Poirot examined it closely and advised her to leave it with him. She mentioned a deal with Lord Yardly to film a play at Yardly Chase. Lady Yardly arrived, revealing that she also received blackmailing letters about the diamond. Poirot decided to involve himself in the case and questioned Lord Yardly about his plans to sell the Star of the East. Lord Yardly explained his financial difficulties and the pressure to sell the jewel, despite Lady Yardly's opposition.",1
"Inside the house, a door opened into the scullery where the back door was located, and another led to the bedroom once belonging to Robert Grant. Poirot meticulously analyzed the crime scene, speaking softly to himself. ""The body was here, indicated by the large dark stain and surrounding splashes. Confusingly, there are traces of both carpet slippers and 'number nine' boots. Additionally, two sets of tracks lead to and from the kitchen, suggesting that the murderer entered this way. Hastings, do you have the boot? Pass it to me."" After examining the boot, Poirot concluded, ""These prints were left by the same person, Robert Grant.""",1
"""It's game over, Mr. Abe Ryland,"" he said with a sly grin. In an instant, the room was filled with armed men who quickly apprehended Ryland and his valet. Poirot exchanged a few words with the commanding officer before pulling me aside. Once we were out of earshot, he enveloped me in a tight hug. ""You're safe, unharmed. It's truly remarkable. I've been kicking myself for letting you walk into danger."" ""I'm fine,"" I reassured him, stepping back. ""But I must admit, I'm a bit confused. You saw through their plan all along, didn't you?"" ""Of course! Why else would I have allowed you to proceed? Your fake identity, your disguise - it was all part of the plan, never meant to fool anyone!"" My jaw dropped in disbelief.",1
"I decided against taking that path due to its high level of risk. Instead, I adorned my finest hat and made my way somberly through the town to speak with our understandably furious grocer. The sole young man to visit our home was a reporter from the Daily Budget. At moments, I found myself envious of Emily, our young maid, who would stroll out with a handsome sailor she was engaged to whenever the opportunity arose. And in the meantime, to stay practiced as she put it, she would also go out with the greengrocer's assistant and the pharmacist's aide. It made me melancholic to realize that I had no one to practice my social skills with.",1
"""But he tracked you down again quite easily, didn't he? Even after all those years had gone by?"" ""Yes, I was fortunate to come across the lawyer's ad."" Poirot decided to stop questioning. Our next step was to pay a visit to Dr. Quentin. His recount was much the same as what he had shared during the inquiry, with few new details. We found him in his office, just finished with his appointments. He appeared to be a sharp individual. His demeanor, along with his pince-nez, suggested a certain formality, yet I suspected he would be quite updated in his approach.""",1
"What was Poirot's true motive in searching for Bella Duveen? Was it related to the murder of Jack Renauld? The girl seemed to have no reason to wish for his death, but perhaps there was a deeper connection between them. Why did she keep returning to Merlinville? These questions circled in my mind as Poirot and I arrived in London, ready to uncover the truth. Time was of the essence, and Poirot was determined to act swiftly. Our next move was to seek out Joseph Aarons, a theatrical agent with connections that might lead us to the elusive Bella Duveen.",1

Following him to London, he met Anita Grünberg, whom I hated for ruining my life. She left the agent's office with an order for the Mill House in Marlow. I trailed them to Knightsbridge, where she went to the Hyde Park Hotel. I followed Carton into the Tube station and tried to confront him, leading to a fatal accident. Realizing the danger I was in, I attached myself to Sir Eustace Pedler as his secretary. The identity of the 'Colonel' remained a mystery, but the search for the truth continued.",1

Suzanne's eyes widened in realization. ""Yes, but what about the connection to Madame Nadina, the Russian dancer?"" I paused, struck by a sudden thought. ""What if the films that Mrs. Blair received were meant for Nadina? And what if they were a crucial piece of evidence in this whole tangled web of deceit?"" Suzanne gasped, her eyes alight with newfound understanding. ""It all makes sense now. The answer lies in those missing films. We must find them.""",1
"""I never knew the key to the safe was missing,"" he admitted. ""It was just a lucky guess that happened to be right. When I noticed the twisted wire on the handle, it made me think that it had been forcibly removed from a keychain. If Mrs. Inglethorp had lost it and found it again, she would have put it back on her ring. But instead, I found a brand new duplicate key on her ring, which made me suspect that someone else had used the original key to open the safe.""",1
"""Quiet,"" he shouted, his hand trembling with anxiety. ""I can't talk until the arrest is made and I know everything is in order. My intuition has let me down. Hastings, if a man leaves a dying message, it must be significant. Everyone dismisses 'Yellow Jasmine? There's yellow jasmine near the house, it's meaningless.'"" ""And what if it's not? Maybe it's literal. Hear me out."" He displayed a small book. ""I thought it might be worth looking into.""",1
"I was welcomed by Mrs. Cavendish in a warm, inviting tone, as I settled into a comfortable chair. I was grateful I had agreed to join John.

A rough tramp intruded into their garden, leading to an unexpected opportunity for the couple. They quickly devised a plan to shift the blame onto the tramp's body, dressing it in the man's clothes and stabbing it with an aeroplane dagger. The husband would then bury the body, ensuring it was found later to divert suspicion. In the meantime, he would disguise himself as the tramp and quietly leave town. However, their carefully laid out plan faced unexpected challenges when a girl named Bella showed up at their door, threatening to unravel everything.",1

"""But witnessing him standing there, pale and lifeless next to the wall, and listening to the incriminating confession escape from his mouth, all my doubts vanished. Poirot, however, directed his attention towards Giraud. “On what basis are you detaining him?” “Do I need to disclose that information to you?” “It would be appreciated as a gesture of respect,” insisted Poirot. Giraud hesitated, torn between outright refusal and the satisfaction of outsmarting his opponent. “You believe I have erred, don't you?” he taunted. “It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility,” Poirot retorted, a hint of mischief in his tone.

"Moreover, what am I to occupy myself with in Pretoria? Marvel at the design of the Union buildings and catch the reverberations of gunfire in Johannesburg?

The entire area has been placed under martial law since two days ago. ""My dear friend,"" I interjected, ""it seems you fail to grasp that I am investigating the situation on the Rand.

"""As we rushed to the Magnificent in a taxi, I pondered the intricacies of the plan. The 'full moon' ruse was quite ingenious, diverting our attention to Friday and leaving us vulnerable earlier. Poirot seemed unfazed, his usual composure returning swiftly. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for him - failure was not something he took lightly. 'Don't worry,' I reassured him. 'There's always another chance.' Upon arrival at the Magnificent, we were promptly led to the manager's office.""",1
"Poirot eagerly opened the sheet of paper and let out a satisfied exclamation. He then placed it on the table and called Hastings over. ""Take a look at this, my friend. Can you determine if that initial is a J or an L?"" The paper was slightly dusty, indicating it had been sitting untouched for a while. However, it was the label that caught Poirot's eye. At the top, it displayed the printed logo of Messrs. Parkson’s, a renowned theatrical costumier. The address read "" (the questionable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St. Mary, Essex.""",1
"Desjardeaux leaped up from his seat, his face flushed with anger. ""Madame Olivier! Preposterous! Ridiculous! What you're saying is an outrage!"" Poirot simply shook his head, offering no response. Desjardeaux stared at him in disbelief for a moment. Then his expression softened, and he looked towards the Home Secretary, tapping his temple knowingly. ""M.

The American kept his promise. Upon reaching the car, Julius felt a wave of relief. The threat had been averted.",1

We assumed it was for the deceased because it was in his overcoat pocket. But, my friend, something about that overcoat seemed odd to me. I measured it and commented on how long it was. That should have sparked some thoughts in your mind.” “I thought you were simply making an observation for the sake of it,” I admitted.",1

Plans were made for me to return to England with Suzanne, getting married in London with the trousseau from Paris. Suzanne loved planning, but the future felt unreal. The night before we sailed, Harry appeared, urging me to run away with him to Rhodesia. I followed him, feeling like a lunatic in love. It's been two years since then, living on the island. Suzanne wrote a letter, calling us lunatics. Another letter arrived from Bolivia, offering me a diary to use as I please. I may now be Lady Eardsley, but the past still haunts me.",1

I turned my gaze to the man at the adjacent table, his complexion ghostly and his movements mechanical as he toyed with the bread.

Not a single feature bore resemblance to the previous identities of Number Four.",1

"I wasn't expecting that the seemingly unimportant note would lead to such a shocking discovery. The body of a woman found in a lonely house, strangled to death, added a whole new layer of mystery to the case.

The new development only heightened my curiosity, pushing me to delve deeper into the dark secrets that seemed to be lurking beneath the surface.",1
"I collected all the necessary information from Mrs. Havering and we quickly discovered that the mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton, had connections to the crime. She seemed to have disappeared after the murder. It was evident that she had played a crucial role in providing an alibi for Mrs. Havering during the time of the crime. The murderer had arrived and escaped in a car, which also brought Mrs. Middleton to her new position. The revolver found at Ealing was a diversion tactic, and the true culprits managed to evade justice. It was a complex and well-executed plan, leaving us no choice but to accept the hand of Fate in this matter.",1
"As Japp's men hurried over at the sound of Poirot's whistle, they discovered four unconscious Chinamen in the hallway. However, the man who had previously threatened me was conspicuously absent. Recalling the moment I was pushed onto the doorstep to lure Poirot inside, I realized that this man had deliberately stayed out of sight. It appeared that he had cleverly avoided the gas bomb and escaped through one of the numerous exits we later uncovered. Despite questioning the four individuals we apprehended, they revealed nothing of value. Even the most thorough police investigation failed to uncover any connection between them and the notorious Big Four.",1

Or perhaps, to instill fear and deter me from my investigation? It appeared unlikely. So, why did he pay a visit?

Rue des Echelles, 11:00 a.m.""",1
"“Perhaps it has been here for quite some time. However, it holds no interest for me.” “On the contrary, I find it quite intriguing,” Poirot replied with a touch of sweetness. I suspected he was simply trying to provoke the Paris detective, and if that was his goal, he certainly achieved it. The other man turned away abruptly, stating that he was not willing to waste any more time. He then bent down to continue his thorough search of the area. Meanwhile, Poirot, as if struck by a sudden inspiration, stepped back across the boundary and tested the door of the small shed. “It's locked,” Giraud remarked without looking. “But it's only where the gardener stores his junk.”",1
"Poirot took the lead as we left the town, making our way towards the Villa Geneviève. However, upon reaching the Villa Marguerite, he stopped abruptly. ""I must ensure that Jack Renauld is safe. Hastings, accompany me. Perhaps Mademoiselle should stay outside. Madame Daubreuil's words may be hurtful."" We opened the gate and proceeded up the pathway. Turning the corner of the house, I pointed out a window on the first floor to Poirot. Projected on the blind was the silhouette of Marthe Daubreuil. ""Ah!"" exclaimed Poirot.",1
"Poirot examined the spade and gloves that belonged to Renauld, the victim of the crime. He noted the attention to detail in the planning of the murder, with the killer using Renauld's own dagger and spade to avoid leaving traces. Giraud, the Paris detective, was focused on the ground while Poirot took interest in a piece of lead-piping nearby. Despite Giraud's dismissal, Poirot found it intriguing. As they continued their investigation, Poirot questioned the significance of a whitewashed line around the grave, revealing his unique approach to solving the case.",1
"I was struck by the unflappable demeanor of Poirot. His composure was truly remarkable. Eagerly, I anticipated his next inquiry, only to be underwhelmed. ""When you entered Mrs. Inglethorp's chamber, was the entrance to Miss Cynthia's quarters secured?"" ""Indeed, sir; it always was. It had remained unopened."" ""And the doorway to Mr. Inglethorp's room? Did you observe if it was fastened as well?"" Annie paused. ""I cannot say for certain, sir; it was closed but I cannot confirm if it was bolted."" ""Upon your departure, did Mrs. Inglethorp lock the door behind you?"" ""No, sir, not at that moment, but I presume she did so later. Typically, she would secure it at night. The entryway to the corridor, that is.""",1

Unfortunately, he hasn't been feeling well lately,"" I revealed.""Interesting. How long has he been working for you?"" Anne probed further, her eyes fixed on me.""Not too long, actually. I hired him right before my trip,"" I disclosed, trying to be vague.Anne didn't miss a beat.

"“Feel free to inquire about anything, Monsieur Poirot,” Willard stated. “We are completely bewildered by this odd string of events, but we truly believe it is simply a series of coincidences.” Despite his words, there was a noticeable nervousness in his demeanor. Poirot carefully observed him. “Are you truly dedicated to this task, Sir Guy?” “Absolutely. Regardless of what may occur, the work will continue. Rest assured of that.” Poirot turned to the doctor. “And what is your stance on the matter, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” the doctor drawled, “I have no intention of giving up.” Poirot responded with one of his characteristic expressive grimaces.",1
"At the trial, the prisoner Renauld sat nervously next to his lawyer, Maître Grosíer. A stern guard, armed with a gleaming sabre, stood watch by the door, while the diligent greffier busied himself at his desk. The magistrate wasted no time. ""Renauld,"" he interrogated, ""do you still claim you were in Cherbourg on the night of the crime, despite all evidence pointing to Merlinville?"" Jack hesitated, his voice trembling as he repeated, ""I told you, I was in Cherbourg."" Maître Grosíer's expression darkened, a mix of frustration and disappointment.",1
"“Inglethorp's dying words were an accusation against her husband,” Poirot explained. I nodded in understanding. “It's good to see John and his wife reconciled,” I remarked. “Yes, thanks to me,” Poirot replied confidently. I raised an eyebrow in confusion. “The trial brought them together,” he continued. “John still loved his wife, and she loved him, but they had drifted apart due to a misunderstanding. She had married him without love.”",1
"Taxis were abundant in the area, and as one departed, another arrived at the curb in response to Tommy's firm gesture. ""Follow the taxi ahead,"" the young man instructed. The elderly driver seemed indifferent, simply grunting before lowering his flag. The journey was quiet. Tommy's taxi stopped at the departure area right after Whittington's. Tommy followed closely behind at the ticket counter, purchasing a first-class ticket to Bournemouth. Boris noted, checking the time on the clock: ""You're ahead of schedule. You still have almost thirty minutes.""",1
"As the morning sun rose, a startling piece of news arrived in the form of a telegram. It was a plea for help, urging immediate action in the wake of a tragic event. Without hesitation, we embarked on a journey to a remote location, guided by the grim reality of a murder that had taken place the night before. The desolate surroundings only added to the mystery and sense of foreboding that hung in the air. Despite the uncertainty and lack of details, one thing was clear - the need for a skilled detective to unravel the truth behind this heinous crime.",1
"New York police report a highly mysterious disappearance. The missing individual is approximately 33 years old, with brown hair, fair complexion, and gray eyes. Standing at a height of 5 ft. 10-1/2 in. ""Fascinating,"" I murmured, setting the newspaper aside. ""After months of investigation, these four names are all they have to show? Which one do you find most suspicious?"" Poirot responded with a meaningful gesture. ""My friend, at this juncture, it remains uncertain. Note that Claud Darrell has recently traveled to both China and America, a detail that may hold significance. However, we must not allow ourselves to be swayed too heavily by this. It could simply be a coincidence."" ""What should be our next course of action?"" I inquired eagerly.",1
"""Japp always had a way of surprising me with his antics, prompting a chuckle from deep within. Meanwhile, Poirot remained composed as he sifted through his mail. A request to speak at the local boy scouts event, a visit from the Countess of Forfanock - most likely about her pampered lap-dog. But then, a shift in Poirot's demeanor caught my attention. With a sense of urgency, he passed me a particular sheet of paper. 'This is quite unusual,' he remarked. Taking the paper, I began to read.""",1
"""Before he left, the countess approached us and carefully examined my companion. Then, with a mocking tone, she complimented M. Achille Poirot on his cleverness. ""Let's get down to business, Madame,"" she continued. ""Luckily, we have been given some privacy. What do you want in return?"" Confused, Poirot asked, ""What do you mean by 'price'?"" The countess, still laughing, revealed her true intentions: ""Madame, you hold the key to our escape. You know the secret passages of this place. I ask again, what is your price?"" And once more, she burst into laughter.""",1
"It was nearly dark when we finally reached our destination, the village bathed in the fading light of the summer evening. We pulled up to the edge of town and sought directions from a weathered local. ""Granite Bungalow,"" he mumbled, scratching his head, ""you're after Granite Bungalow, aye?"" Confirming our destination, the man gestured towards a modest stone house at the far end of the road. ""That's the Bungalow. Are you here to speak with the Detective?"" Startled, Poirot interjected, ""Detective? What Detective?"" The man's eyes widened, ""You haven't heard about the murder then? Gruesome affair, they say. Blood everywhere.""",1
"""That leaves us with two options: either he had prior knowledge of the event or he had his own motive for being absent."" ""And what might that motive be?"" I inquired, doubtful. Poirot simply shrugged. ""Who can say? Likely unsavory. Mr. Inglethorp appears to be a bit of a rogue, but that doesn't automatically make him a killer."" I furrowed my brow, not entirely convinced. ""We seem to be at odds, don't we?"" Poirot remarked. ""Let's agree to disagree for now. Time will reveal the truth. Let's now focus on other angles of the investigation.""",1
"""He will reveal everything he knows."" ""I appreciate it."" Tuppence experienced a surge of excitement. This newfound courage drove her to take even bolder actions. ""But there is one more thing."" ""Go on."" Leaning in, Tuppence spoke in a hushed tone. ""Who exactly is Mr. Brown?"" A flicker of fear flashed across the woman's face. Mrs. Vandemeyer struggled to compose herself and regain her composure, but it was a feeble attempt. She nonchalantly shrugged. ""You must not have done your homework if you are unaware that Mr. Brown is a mystery to all."" ""Except you,"" Tuppence remarked calmly.",1
"She was standing there with her eyes cast down, a faint enigmatic smile on her lips, filling me with a sense of fear, like one might feel towards a beautiful but deadly snake. Poirot, always polite, inquired about M. Stonor and Mrs. Renauld, to which Madame Daubreuil responded calmly. As we made our way to the Villa Geneviève, Poirot kept a watchful eye on the lighted window. Suddenly, a cry for help shattered the silence, prompting Poirot to take swift action. With Cinderella's acrobatic skills, a dangerous rescue mission unfolded. The tension mounted as the true identity of the murderer was revealed, leaving us all in shock. The night was filled with chaos and danger, but in the end, justice prevailed.",1
"""My initial plan was to spend a few days exploring the Falls, a sight I have yet to witness despite this being my third trip to Africa. Afterwards, I intended to travel to Jo’burg to analyze the state of affairs on the Rand. Back in my country, I am regarded as an expert on South African politics. However, based on what I have been told, Jo’burg will soon become a rather inhospitable destination. I have no desire to investigate the situation amidst a potential uprising."" Race responded with a condescending smile. ""I believe your concerns are unfounded, Sir Eustace.""",1
"""Who could have known?"" Tommy added. ""Can't fault him for that. Thanks to his quick move, I get to meet you all in person."" The group seemed unsettled by his words, but the German leader calmed them with a simple gesture. ""No one will spill the beans,"" he stated calmly. ""But I'm still breathing,"" Tommy retorted. ""Not for long,"" the German replied. The group murmured in agreement. Despite his racing heart, Tommy remained cool. ""I beg to differ,"" he insisted. ""I have no interest in meeting my demise.""",1
"Maltravers, a man with a young and beautiful wife, seemingly gathered all his available funds to pay for a life insurance policy for her before taking his own life. This scenario, although tragic, is not unheard of in our society. A friend of mine, Alfred Wright, who happens to be a director at Northern Union, has urged me to look into the details of this case. However, I must admit that I am not particularly optimistic about uncovering the truth. If the cause of death had been listed as heart failure, I might have been more hopeful. The term ""heart failure"" often serves as a convenient cover-up in such situations.",1
"""Harry smirked. “We’re in a sticky situation, darling. Concerned?” “Not when I’m with you.” “Ah, but going out in a blaze of glory isn’t ideal. We can do better than that. Looks like they’re splitting into two groups this time. Landing in different spots. Now for my little dramatic touch.” Just then, a bright flame erupted from the cabin. Its glow revealed two mysterious figures huddled on the rooftop. “Using my worn-out clothes stuffed with rags as decoys. They won’t catch on right away. Come on, Anne, we must resort to extreme measures.” Holding hands, we sprinted across the island.""",1
"""Keep a close eye on the man-servant, Ivan. Do not let him escape. This is crucial,"" he slammed the receiver and faced me. ""Do you understand now, Hastings? Let me clarify. Wilson did not die from poison, but from electrocution. A metal rod hidden in a chess piece conducted the fatal current through him when it touched a specific square on the floor. Wilson, being left-handed, had the electric burn on his left hand as the only clue.""",1
"Philips gestured subtly towards the prisoner, who remained oblivious to the implication. The motivation behind the deceased's decision to create a new will, despite the existence of the previous one, was a mystery to him. Perhaps the old lady had simply forgotten about the original will, or maybe she believed it had been invalidated by her marriage - there had been discussions on the matter. It was not uncommon for women to lack knowledge in legal matters. Notably, she had drafted a new will in favor of the prisoner a year prior. He intended to present evidence demonstrating that it was the prisoner who had served his stepmother coffee on the night of her demise.",1
"""But why the delay? What is holding you back?” “I am awaiting the arrival of the Olympia. She is scheduled to return from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you already know the identity of the bond thief, why the hesitation? He might elude capture.” “Escape to a remote South Sea island with no extradition laws? No, my friend, life would be far from pleasant for him there. As for the reason behind my waiting, well, to the keen intellect of Hercule Poirot the solution is crystal clear, but for those less astute like Inspector McNeil, it may be prudent to conduct some inquiries to confirm the details. It is important to show compassion for those who lack the same level of insight.”",1
"""Would you like to join me at the mortuary to inspect Wilson's body before the examination begins? Perhaps his tie-pin is out of place, offering a crucial clue to unravel the mystery."" ""My dear Japp, I've been tempted all evening to adjust your own tie-pin during dinner. May I? There, much better. Absolutely, let's head to the mortuary."" Poirot seemed fully engrossed in the case, sparking a level of enthusiasm I hadn't seen in him for quite some time. I was glad to see him back to his usual self.",1
"""As he rose, his hand found its way to my shoulder, his expression shifting entirely. Glistening tears welled up in his eyes. “Throughout this entire ordeal, my thoughts are consumed by the late Mrs. Inglethorp. She may not have been adored by many, but she showed great kindness to us Belgians. I am indebted to her.” I attempted to interject, but Poirot forged ahead. “Listen closely, Hastings. It would crush her spirit to know that I stood idly by while her husband, Alfred Inglethorp, faced arrest when a mere utterance from me could spare him!” In the days leading up to the inquest, Poirot maintained an unwavering pace. He held private discussions with Mr. Wells on two occasions and embarked on lengthy strolls through the countryside.""",1
"… I barely had time to entertain the chilling thought that had crossed my mind before Jack Renauld entered the room. Poirot greeted him with a professional demeanor. ""Please, have a seat, sir. I apologize for the inconvenience, but you must understand that I find the atmosphere of the Villa quite unpleasant. M. Giraud and I have differing opinions on several matters.

Poirot's clever manipulation forces Rolf to hand over the stolen diamond. Mary Marvell's innocence is highlighted, while Lady Yardly is exposed as the true culprit.

Identifying himself as Mr. Lowen, he was escorted to the study per the banker's request. Nearly sixty minutes elapsed with no sign of Mr. Davenheim. Frustrated, Mr. Lowen rang the bell, indicating his need to depart in order to catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim, puzzled by her husband's absence despite expecting the visitor, apologized for the situation.""",1

""I reckon spy work does that to you!"" During the silence that followed, Mr. Carter produced a worn-out brown book from his pocket.

"""What do you mean by ‘vanish’? To which category of vanishing are you alluding?” “Are vanishings organized and categorized, then?” I chuckled. Japp grinned as well. Poirot scowled at us both. “But of course they are! They are divided into three groups: First, and most frequent, the deliberate vanishing act. Second, the often falsified ‘amnesia’ scenario, uncommon, but occasionally legitimate. Third, homicide, and the more or less effective disposal of the corpse. Do you consider all three as unattainable?” “Almost certainly, I would say. You may lose your own memory, but someone would surely identify you particularly in the instance of a prominent figure like Davenheim.”",1
"“It was inevitable that suspicion would fall on him, but concrete evidence, like the purchase of poison, was needed to seal his fate. Given Mr. Inglethorp’s distinctive appearance, acquiring such proof was not a challenge. Despite never directly interacting with Mr. Inglethorp, young Mace harbored no uncertainty that the man before him, clad in his attire and bearing his facial hair and spectacles, was anyone other than Alfred Inglethorp.” “Perhaps,” I replied, captivated by Poirot’s persuasiveness. “Yet, if that were true, why doesn’t he account for his whereabouts at six o’clock on Monday evening?” “Indeed, why?” Poirot pondered, his demeanor now composed.",1

It’s a humbling experience to realize one’s own foolishness. Yet no one savors that revelation. Suddenly, a model of the “Kenilworth Castle” caught my eye at the shipping office. An idea struck. I entered and inquired about the “Kilmorden Castle.” The ticket was exactly the amount of my inheritance. I opted for first class, sealing my fate on this adventure.",1

"I had my suspicions about him, particularly his unwavering insistence on Cabin 17. Maybe it was just his stubborn nature shining through. Stubbornness can be quite the trait. It wouldn't hurt to have a chat with Mr. Chichester, I thought to myself. After a quick fix to my unruly hair, I made my way back up to the deck, determined. Luck was on my side. I spotted my target by the rail, sipping on beef tea. Stepping closer, I addressed him. ""I trust you've let go of the Cabin 17 issue,"" I ventured, flashing a smile. ""I believe holding grudges goes against the grain of true forgiveness,"" Mr. Chichester replied, his tone chilly.",1
"I am certain of Mrs. Renauld's innocence in this case, as her fainting was genuine and her anguish real. She did not need to fake her grief, as she had already shown true emotion upon hearing of her husband's death. The open door at the crime scene puzzled Poirot, who believed that the culprit must have left through the window. This theory was supported by the lack of footprints in one of the flower beds, which had been smoothed over with a rake to erase any trace of the intruder's presence. Despite initial doubts, I began to consider the possibility that the murderer had indeed escaped through the window, opening up a new avenue of investigation.",1

"“You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M.

"The roots of the tree in question extended all the way to the rear of the bed, making it necessary to step on the bed in order to reach them. The commissary pointed out that due to the dry weather, no footprints would be visible on the paths or driveway, but they would be noticeable on the soft soil of the flower-bed. Poirot carefully inspected the smooth surface of the bed, confirming Bex's observation that there were no marks or indentations.

"Poirot, Bex, and Giraud were gathered in the room, discussing the disappearance of a dagger from the glass jar. Hastings then admitted his grave fault of showing a young lady the body, leaving the door unlocked for twenty minutes. The commissary found it deplorable, but Giraud surprisingly called it admirable, suggesting that the assassin or an accomplice had been near the Villa recently. Poirot noted that the assassin wore gloves, ensuring no fingerprints were left on the dagger. The magistrate's clerk began gathering the papers as M. Hautet announced the end of their work in the room.",1
"The main reason we moved to Little Hampsly was the proximity to Hampsly Cavern, a hidden cave containing artifacts from the Aurignacian culture.

After a persistent cough, my father fell ill with a fever and quickly deteriorated. Despite the doctor's efforts, he succumbed to double pneumonia just four days later.",1
"I trailed behind him, silently mimicking the Barotsi woman I had once observed near the Falls. Unlike her, I wasn't balancing a frying-pan on my head.

Abruptly, he turned, bursting into laughter as he swept me off my feet. ""I'm crazy, my love, I admit it. But I adore you so much."" ""We're both insane. And, Harry, you never asked, but I'm not sacrificing anything! I wanted this journey!"" That was a couple of years back. We're still residing on the island.",1
"As Giraud laid his hat on the table and prepared to deliver his lecture on detective work, Poirot settled in to listen attentively. Giraud confidently outlined his case against Jack Renauld, detailing the motives and means that led to his arrest. But Poirot, with a glint of mischief in his eye, interjected with a crucial detail that Giraud had overlooked. The two men engaged in a battle of wits, each trying to outsmart the other with their theories and deductions. As they walked towards the sea to review the case, Poirot guided Hastings towards the truth with his characteristic cryptic remarks. It was a challenging and exhilarating intellectual exercise, where every detail mattered, and every clue led them closer to unraveling the mystery.",1
"Tommy was taken aback when he saw the note in Tuppence's handwriting, offering him ten shillings. He quickly realized her cleverness in using a different name to protect his identity. Without hesitation, he reached for the money, but the man hesitated. After a moment of tension, Tommy handed over a ten-shilling note and finally got hold of the message. As he read it, his heart sank - Tuppence was in danger, and they were being moved. Wales, Holyhead - the words echoed in his mind as he carefully folded the note, knowing he had to act fast to protect her.",1

Your only chance is to persuade them they’re mistaken. Be careful, always be on the lookout for danger. If you fall into their hands, tell the whole truth.” “Why warn me?” I asked. “It may be the last thing I can do for you,” he said. “Goodbye,” he said as he left, his footsteps echoing along the deck. I was left alone, wondering about the danger that lay ahead.",1
"His cohorts may have incapacitated him with a cloth and chloroform, but I fail to see what their goal was. He is unlikely to be of any help to them now, as he will be closely monitored until the situation with the Prime Minister is resolved. It's possible that he intended to mislead the police? However, he claims that something was placed over his nose and mouth, and he recalls nothing beyond that. This does not lead the investigation astray; it sounds remarkably truthful. Let's head to the station. France may reveal more clues. Although I have my doubts. It's astonishing that the Prime Minister hasn't been found in such a confined area. If the military and police of two nations haven't located him, how can I?",1
"""Dogs followed 'Rita', probably. And I guess that's who Annette meant by Marguerite. I didn't catch on then."" The idea saddened him slightly, as it suggested that Mrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were close. The cab stopped at the Ritz. Tommy entered the esteemed establishment eagerly, but his excitement was short-lived. He was told that Miss Cowley had left fifteen minutes earlier. PERPLEXED momentarily, Tommy wandered into the dining area and requested a meal of exceptional quality. His recent four-day confinement had reminded him of the importance of good food.",1
"""People are always curious about my activities."" ""Not in this bustling city. Everyone is too preoccupied to even take notice of you."" ""You seem to have a knack for making such comments. But no matter, I'll let it go. It will be quite an adventure. What are your plans for this afternoon?"" ""Well,"" Tuppence pondered. ""I was considering hats! Or maybe silk stockings! Or perhaps..."" ""Hold on,"" Tommy interjected. ""Let's not exceed fifty pounds! But we must have dinner and see a show tonight no matter what."" ""Absolutely."" The day went by pleasantly. The evening was even better. Two of the five-pound notes were now spent. They met as planned the next morning and headed towards the city.",1
"""His hair was a thick mass of grizzled strands, and a lengthy black cigar (which, as I would discover, was a constant fixture) dangled casually from his lips. ""Take a seat,"" he muttered. I obliged. Pointing to the document on the table, he remarked, ""This here indicates you're the real deal, no need for further inspection. Tell me, do you have a good grasp on social issues?"" Assuring him of my capabilities, I was ready to proceed.""",1
"Lady Willard was terrified for her son, who seemed determined to continue his father's work in Egypt despite the dangers. Poirot promised to protect him, but the deaths surrounding the expedition raised suspicions. Rupert Bleibner's suicide and mysterious letter hinted at a more modern crime, possibly involving poison. As Poirot and Hastings arrived in Egypt, they learned of another death from tetanus. Dr. Ames and Mr. Harper shared insights about the deceased, while Poirot's theories about ancient Egyptian spirits caused skepticism among the others. Poirot's unorthodox methods and belief in superstition led the investigation in a new direction.",1
"I had no trouble executing my plans. Found a small hotel in a back street, got a room, paid deposit without luggage, and went to bed. Next morning, up early to buy clothes. Waited for the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia to leave with most of the party. Took a tram out of town for a walk. My shoe-lace came untied, a man almost walked into me. Recognized him as the man from the night before. He followed me. Got off tram, he did too. Hailed next tram, he followed. Realized I was up against a gang, led by the ""Colonel"".

"Carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a precise line, a satisfied grin on his face. Time ticked by. The Opalsens remained absent. ""Interesting,"" I commented, breaking the silence. ""I wonder when they'll reappear."" Poirot observed the smoke spiraling upwards before stating, ""They won't be returning."" ""But why?"" I inquired. ""What makes you so sure?"" Poirot's smile widened. ""Just a while back, the manager dashed out of his office and hurried upstairs. Clearly, something has gone amiss.""",1
"Mrs. Havering had been searching for a new housekeeper and had interviewed several candidates. However, when she sent the engagement fee, she failed to inform them of her decision. Disappointed, I returned to London where I found Poirot lounging in a flamboyant silk robe. He welcomed me warmly, expressing his fondness for me. ""My dear Hastings, how delightful to see you! Have you had a good time? Have you been assisting Japp and conducting your own investigations?"" ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""this case is shrouded in darkness! It seems unsolvable.""",1
"His account matched that of Miss Farquhar in every detail. After he had finished speaking, Poirot picked up the conversation with a query. ""What specifically prompted you to realize that the bonds had been taken, Mr. Ridgeway?"" He chuckled bitterly. ""The evidence was right in front of me, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn't have overlooked it. My cabin trunk was partially pulled out from under the bunk, with visible scratches and cuts where the thieves attempted to break the lock."" ""Yet I was under the impression that it was opened with a key?"" ""Indeed. They attempted to force it, but to no avail.""",1
"The encounter was quite impactful! Throughout the tenth month, reprimanded by a nurse for frequenting the cinema with a patient, specifically the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. In the eleventh and twelfth months, returned to normal duties as a parlourmaid with great achievement. Departed the hospital at the year's end with much fanfare. Following that, the skillful Miss Cowley operated various vehicles including a delivery van, a truck, and a military vehicle! The latter being the most enjoyable. He was a rather young officer!” “Which officer was that?” Tommy asked.",1

In a matter of moments, he reappeared, leading in the trembling Françoise. “Are you Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, sir.” “You served at the Villa Geneviève for quite some time?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. When she sold the Villa this spring, I agreed to stay on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate interrupted her. “No need to explain further. Now, Françoise, whose responsibility was it to secure the front door at night?” “Mine, sir.""",1
"""Is it possible? My husband was the most absent-minded man."" Her brow furrowed slightly as she mentioned this particular flaw in her late husband. The commissary interjected, ""I believe there is an important conclusion to be drawn here. The fact that the men required M. Renauld to dress himself suggests that the location they intended to bring him, where 'the secret' was hidden, was quite a distance away."" The magistrate agreed, ""Indeed, not too close, but also not too far, considering he expected to return by morning.""",1
"""I am the product of my father's legacy. Would anyone accept me if they knew the truth?"" ""You are indeed your father's son. My colleague Hastings can attest to my belief in the power of genetics."" ""Alright, then."" ""Wait. I know of a remarkable woman, one filled with bravery and resilience, capable of immense love and selflessness."" The young man's gaze lifted. His expression softened. ""My mother!"" ""Yes. You carry both your mother's and father's traits within you. Go now to Mademoiselle Bella. Confide in her completely. Hold nothing back and await her response!"" Jack hesitated. ""Approach her not as a boy, but as a man burdened by the past and the present, yet hopeful for a bright future ahead.""",1
"""Who is this guy? What's his deal? Oh, geez, I'd give up two years of my life just to have this boat leave tomorrow instead of today.

""I'll give it my all, Poirot,"" I promised. ""I'll try to step in effectively."" ""Hmm."" His response seemed somewhat uncertain to me. I picked up the paper.

"""Then you think it's more likely that the drug was in the coffee, but for some reason, its effects were delayed."" ""Yes, but since the cup was completely shattered, we can't analyze its contents."" Dr. Bauerstein's testimony ended there. Dr. Wilkins confirmed everything. When it came to the possibility of suicide, he completely denied it. The deceased, he explained, had a weak heart but was otherwise healthy and had a happy and stable personality. Taking her own life would be the last thing she would do. Lawrence Cavendish was then summoned to testify.",1

""Not quite. I, too, almost reached the same conclusion. It crossed my mind when I inquired Mr. Wells about the will. Also, there were the bromide powders she prepared, and her skillful acts of impersonation, as Dorcas described. The evidence pointed more towards her than anyone else.""

"He inquired, ""Do you suspect your mistress of taking a sleeping powder last night?"" The servant replied, ""No, the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago.""

"He found his lifelong friend dead in the dingy room, betrayed by his own words. In the dead man's pocket, he discovered the ominous draft treaty, which he promptly burned in front of the others. England was safe! On the night of the 30th, in a secluded area at the Savoy, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was entertaining his visitors. The initial guest to show up was Mr. Carter, accompanied by an irritable elderly man who made Tommy turn red with anger at the mere sight of him. Tommy approached them.",1
"After engaging in a heated argument with the guard, causing a stir among passengers, Poirot suggested a discreet exit strategy. Following his lead, Pierre Combeau, a close associate of Poirot's, cooperated seamlessly. As we approached the outskirts of Paris, Combeau executed a dramatic distraction by pulling the communication cord. Utilizing the chaos to our advantage, Poirot and I slipped away unnoticed. Our initial priority was a swift transformation of our looks, facilitated by Poirot's preparedness with a compact case of essentials.",1
"""I'll be there in a minute, my friend. Just about done. Gotta get rid of this pesky grease spot!"" He gestured with his sponge. I smirked, lighting another cigarette. ""Watching anything interesting?"" I asked a few moments later. ""Helping a 'charlady' track down her missing husband. Tricky situation, requires finesse. I suspect he won't be too happy when we find him. Can't blame him, really. Takes a discerning man to get lost like that."" I chuckled.",1
"A journal can be a tool for documenting the peculiarities of others, but not one's own."" ""However, there is such a thing as unintentional self-disclosure."" ""In the view of a psychoanalyst, everything is considered vile,"" I stated in a knowing tone. ""I imagine you've had quite the adventurous life, Colonel Race?"" inquired Miss Beddingfeld, fixing him with a mesmerized gaze. This is how they operate, these women! Othello captivated Desdemona with his tales, yet, oh, didn't Desdemona captivate Othello with her attentive demeanor? Anyway, the young woman certainly piqued Race's interest. He proceeded to recount tales of bravery.",1
"""Pas du tout,” said Poirot firmly. “She sought my help on the advice of Mary Cavendish. Upon learning that Mary Marvell, her enemy, had visited, she quickly changed her mind, seizing the opportunity presented by your words. A brief interrogation revealed that you had mentioned the letters to her, not the other way around. She eagerly embraced the chance your words provided.” “I find that hard to believe,” I retorted, feeling offended. “Si, si, mon ami, it is regrettable that you do not study psychology,"" replied Poirot.",1
"""The cash is easily brought in thanks to our associate here,"" stated a voice that Tommy suspected belonged to the tall, authoritative man whose face he recognized.

Have you taken care of the details to our satisfaction?""  ""I believe so,"" Boris replied.  ""Excellent. If needed, Moscow will issue an official denial,"" the sibilant voice continued.  After a brief pause, the German's voice rang out, breaking the silence: ""I have been instructed by Mr. XYZ.""",1
"""As far as I know, Sir Eustace, he believes so and he must have the knowledge to confirm that."" ""By the way, where is he?"" I questioned. ""I haven't seen him since we got on board."" ""He claims to be unwell, and remains in his cabin, Sir Eustace."" Pagett's voice lowered once more. ""But I'm certain that's a cover. So he can observe better."" ""Observe?"" ""For your protection, Sir Eustace. In case there's an attempt on your life."" ""You're such a ray of sunshine, Pagett,"" I remarked. ""I hope your mind doesn't run wild. If I were you, I'd attend the party dressed as a grim reaper or a hangman. It matches your gloomy appearance."" That silenced him temporarily. I headed to the upper deck.""",1
"Pagett always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else. As I leisurely settled into my deck-chair next to Mrs. Blair, I couldn't help but comment on the state of the clergy in modern times. Casually, I extended an invitation to Mrs. Blair to join me for dinner on the evening of the upcoming Fancy Dress dance, a proposition that Race somehow finagled his way into as well. Following lunch, the Beddingfeld girl joined us for coffee, confirming my previous observation about the exceptional quality of her legs. Without a doubt, I will be extending an invitation to her for dinner too.",1
"""I have a photograph that might help,"" she said tentatively. ""A photograph?"" Poirot's eyes lit up with interest. ""It's quite old, about eight years or so."" ""No matter! I would be delighted to see it,"" Poirot exclaimed eagerly. ""Feel free to make a copy if you wish."" ""Thank you, I appreciate that,"" Miss Monro replied. ""Well, I should be going now,"" she added with a smile.",1
"""You're certain of that?"" ""Yes."" ""No small disagreements, right?"" Jack simply shrugged. ""Everyone's entitled to their own opinion."" ""Of course, of course. But if someone were to claim that you had a heated argument with your father before leaving for Paris, that person would be lying, correct?"" I couldn't help but admire Giraud's cleverness. His claim that ""I know everything"" was no joke. Jack Renauld seemed uneasy at the question. ""We did argue,"" he confessed. ""Ah, an argument! And during that argument, did you say: 'When you're dead, I can do what I want'?"" ""I might have,"" Jack muttered.",1
"""But tell me, Poirot,"" I countered, ""what compelled him to take the risk of showing up in the first place? If his plan was to retrieve the body later, then his visit could make sense. He would have been eliminating any incriminating evidence. Yet, as it stands, it appears he left empty-handed."" Poirot dismissed my argument with a characteristic Gallic gesture. ""Ah, Hastings, you fail to consider the perspective of Number Four,"" he remarked. ""You mention evidence, but what concrete proof do we possess against him? Admittedly, there is a corpse, but we lack any definitive evidence that points to murder. Prussic acid, when inhaled, vanishes without a trace.""",1
"“There is much to ponder in this, my friend!” “It’s quite perplexing,” I concurred. “Then we have Mrs. Cavendish,” Poirot added. “She’s another one withholding information! What are your thoughts on her behavior?” “I’m at a loss. It’s hard to believe that she’s protecting Alfred Inglethorp. But that’s how it appears.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “Indeed, it’s strange. One thing is clear, she heard much more of that ‘private conversation’ than she’s letting on.” “And yet she’s the least likely person to be caught eavesdropping!” “Precisely.",1
"I pondered what to do with a man of his nature. ""If it's too shameful to share with me,"" I started with malice. Finally, I hit a nerve. Pagett tensed up and turned red. ""Shameful? Ashamed? I'm lost."" ""Then explain it to me."" In just three sentences, he spilled the beans. And there it was, Pagett's hidden truth revealed! It was nothing like I had anticipated. I made my way back to the hotel in a daze. A telegram was waiting for me. I ripped it apart.",1
"I would have been more content if I could have laid him to rest in a cave adorned with ancient art and tools, but the community's expectations led to a tidy grave (complete with marble slab) in the unattractive local churchyard. The vicar's attempts to offer solace fell short. It was only after some time that I grasped the reality that the independence I had always yearned for was now mine. Despite being an orphan with little money, I was finally free. Simultaneously, I recognized the remarkable compassion of these generous individuals. The vicar made a strong appeal for me to assist his wife who was in immediate need of a companion.",1
"The juvenile members of the human species display certain characteristics resembling those of anthropoids, while the young chimpanzees exhibit similarities to humans more so than adult chimpanzees. This suggests that our predecessors had greater Simian traits than we do, whereas chimpanzees' ancestors were of a more advanced nature compared to the current species, implying that the chimpanzee is in decline. The resourceful publication, the Daily Budget, in need of sensational material, promptly published bold headlines. ""Are we the ancestors of monkeys, or are monkeys our descendants? Distinguished Professor claims chimpanzees are deteriorating versions of humans.""",1

She fell back into unconsciousness and has not uttered a word since.” “Is she in critical condition?” “Just a few bruises and cuts; honestly, from a medical standpoint, the injuries are quite minor considering her current state. Her condition is likely due to the emotional shock of regaining her memory.” “She remembers now?” exclaimed Julius eagerly. Sir James impatiently tapped the table. “Without a doubt, Mr. Hersheimmer, as she was able to disclose her true identity. I assumed you had grasped that detail.",1
"""Schneider today,"" and then some more of the same. Young Bleibner hurried off to Cairo immediately."" ""Was he in good health when he left?"" ""The old man?"" ""No, the young one.""

""Will you be staying with the expedition, Mr. Harper?"" ""No, sir, I will not. I plan to head to New York as soon as I can wrap things up here.""",1
"""The small grey matter always remembers the small grey matter, my friend!"" I settled into my chair, responding casually to Poirot's greeting by mentioning that a one-hour sea journey from Calais to Dover could hardly be considered ""terrible."" Poirot vigorously disagreed, waving his egg-spoon to emphasize his point. ""Not at all! If in one hour one endures sensations and emotions of the utmost terror, one has truly lived! Does not one of your English poets suggest that time is measured not by hours, but by heartbeats?"" ""I believe Browning was alluding to something more romantic than seasickness, however."" ""Because he was an Englishman, an islander for whom the English Channel meant nothing.""",1
"""What's that?"" I exclaimed. ""Mon Dieu!"" exclaimed Poirot. ""It sounds very much like your 'uninvited visitor' in my bedroom."" ""But how could someone get in there? There's only one entrance, and it's through this room."" ""Your memory serves you well, Hastings. Time for some deductions."" ""The window! So it's a thief then? He must have had quite the climb. I would almost call it impossible."" I got up from my chair and walked towards the door, but the sound of someone fiddling with the handle on the other side stopped me in my tracks.

"The officer and the small man were walking across the street when they spotted me. The man pointed me out to the officer excitedly. Without hesitation, I sprinted away, underestimating the officer's speed. As I ran down Adderly Street, I could feel the eyes of the onlookers on me, anticipating someone to intervene. Desperation set in, and I blurted out, “Where's the station?” Gasping for air, I followed the directions and dashed towards it, hoping to catch a train. Suddenly, I heard rapid footsteps approaching from behind. To my dismay, the little man with the prominent nose was right on my tail, proving to be a remarkable sprinter.",1

"""Sacre bleu!"" Poirot exclaimed. ""That Giraud, always in a rush. I won't have time to organize this drawer properly. Let's hurry."" Hastily, he dumped the contents onto the floor, revealing mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly, Poirot's eyes lit up as he found a small square cardboard - a photograph. After pocketing it, he carelessly stuffed the items back into the drawer. Grabbing my arm, he swiftly led me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hallway, Giraud was standing, observing his suspect. ""Good day, M. Giraud,"" greeted Poirot. ""What do we have here?"" Giraud gestured towards Jack.",1
"I briefed Cinderella on how the discovery unfolded, and she paid close attention, occasionally posing insightful questions. We then headed towards the Villa, with me being cautious, not eager to encounter anyone. Leading the girl through the shrubbery to the rear of the house, where the small shed stood, I recalled that M. Bex had entrusted the key to Marchaud the previous evening. It was possible that the Sûreté detective had returned it to Marchaud after using it.",1

"The latch was firmly in place. Covered in a thick layer of dust, it was clear that no one had touched it in quite some time. With a careful twist and turn, Tommy was able to slide it back without a sound. Moving on to the handle, he applied the same technique and this time, it worked like a charm. The door creaked open just a sliver, but it was enough for Tommy to eavesdrop on the conversation inside. A heavy velvet curtain blocked his view, but he could still make out the voices with surprising clarity. It was the Sinn Feiner speaking, his distinct Irish accent ringing through the room: ""That's all fine and dandy.",1
"She let out a muffled scream, and I couldn't help but gasp in shock. Standing before me was none other than Cinderella, my friend from the train! The feeling of astonishment was mutual. ""You,"" we both said at the same time. It was Cinderella who composed herself first. ""My dear Aunt!"" she cried. ""What brings you here?"" ""And what about you?"" I shot back. ""Just the other day, you were on your way back to England like a dutiful child. Did they give you a permanent pass to travel back and forth, thanks to your connections in Parliament?""

To begin, I have a question for you.""",1
"“She wasn’t a patient at the hospital! She was a nurse!” “I believe,” Tommy retorted furiously, “she may have orchestrated this scheme right from the beginning.

He has full knowledge of my findings regarding the Big Four, and despite skepticism from others, he trusts in my work. Ryland, Madame Olivier, and even Li Chang Yen may think they are free to act, but they are under close scrutiny.""",1
"The doorbell rang, prompting Jeanne to answer it. She returned holding a card. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer lazily reached for the card, but upon reading the name “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a spark of interest ignited in her eyes. “I will see him. Jeanne, fetch the maize peignoir quickly. And when the Count arrives, you may leave.” “Of course, Madame.” Jeanne brought the peignoir, a delicate blend of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, smiling to herself as she sat down, tapping a slow rhythm on the dressing-table with one long white hand. The Count wasted no time in taking advantage of the invitation extended to him - a man of average height, slender, graceful, pallid, and remarkably fatigued.",1
"Madame Beroldy was the kind of woman who could captivate any man. Her beauty and mysterious aura drew people in, including the wealthy American, Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. But behind closed doors, a dark and twisted plot was unfolding. One fateful night, the Beroldys' home was breached by masked intruders, leading to a gruesome discovery. Madame Beroldy was found bound and gagged, while her husband lay lifeless with a knife through his heart. The investigation pointed towards Madame Beroldy and her alleged lover, Georges Conneau. Despite her royal blood claims and elaborate stories, the truth eventually came to light when a confession letter from Conneau surfaced, revealing the shocking extent of their deadly plan.",1
"""Mon ami, someone has interfered with it. There were still three days left. It's an eight-day clock, do you understand?"" ""But why would they do that? Trying to throw off the investigation by making it seem like the crime happened at four o'clock?"" ""No, no; rethink your theories, my friend. Engage your brain. You are Mayerling. You hear something, maybe, and you know your fate is sealed. You have just enough time to leave a clue. Four o'clock, Hastings. Number Four, the end. Ah! I have an idea!"" He hurried into the adjacent room and grabbed the phone. He requested to speak with Hanwell.",1
"I am eager to uncover the secrets that Pagett was hiding during his time in Florence. His behavior always takes a turn whenever Italy is brought into the conversation. Despite his reputation for respectability, I can't help but wonder if there is a darker side to him. The thought of Pagett harboring a guilty secret is both thrilling and intriguing. The events of the evening have been nothing short of strange. While visiting the barber's shop, the only outfit that fit me was a Teddy Bear costume. Although I enjoy playing pretend with young women back home, dressing as a bear is far from ideal for the warm climate of the equator.",1
"Blair welcomed the idea, mentioning that if I were murdered, it would be a terrific scoop for Anne. Tomorrow, we will pass through Bechuanaland, where the dust will be atrocious. At each station, Kafir children sell quaint wooden animals they carve themselves, along with mealie bowls and baskets. Mrs. Blair seems captivated by the primitive charm of these toys. Friday evening arrived, and my fears were confirmed - Mrs. Blair and Anne purchased forty-nine wooden animals. My journey to Rhodesia was thoroughly enjoyable.",1
"I heard the sound of running feet in the passage. Suddenly, a man burst into my cabin, pleading for help. With quick thinking, I hid him behind my cabin trunk and wash-basin, disguising myself as a lady preparing to wash. A night stewardess interrupted, warning of a drunk man causing trouble. After bandaging the wounded man's stab wound, he refused my help coldly. I felt a sense of danger from him, especially when he refused to thank me for saving his life. The next morning, I discovered someone had searched my cabin. Determined to uncover the truth, I kept a close eye on Sir Eustace Pedler, Mr. Pagett, and the Rev. Edward Chichester. The mysterious events on the ship continued, raising suspicions about the people around me.",1
"""I have no doubts that the culprit was a woman, a woman of exceptional beauty,"" Tuppence stated confidently. ""I defer to your expertise on the technical details,"" Mr. Beresford replied softly. ""It seems evident that this mysterious woman managed to escape."" ""And how do you come to that conclusion?"" ""Think about it, if she hadn't, how would they have discovered Jane Finn had possession of the documents?"" ""You have a point. Please continue, my dear detective."" ""There is a slim possibility, though I must stress it is only a possibility, that this woman could be 'Rita.'"" ""And if that is the case?"" ""In that scenario, we will need to scour the list of survivors from the Lusitania until we locate her.""",1
"""Here you go! Please deliver this card to the commissary right away,"" she said, handing the man the message. He took it and, beckoning to his colleague, whistled. Within moments, another man arrived and received the card from her. After a brief wait, a stout man with a large moustache hurried over to the gate. The officer saluted and stepped aside. ""Ah, my dear detective,"" exclaimed the newcomer, ""I'm so glad you're here. Your timing couldn't be better."" The detective's face lit up. ""Mr. Smith! What a pleasant surprise."" He then glanced in my direction.",1
"""Yes,"" I exclaimed, ""but who is the victim?"" ""I know not. A stranger. They discovered him in the shed just a short distance from poor Monsieur's body. And there's more. He was stabbed, stabbed in the heart with the very same dagger!"" Without hesitation, I sprinted up the path to the shed. The two guards stepped aside to allow me through, and with anticipation coursing through me, I stepped inside. The light was dim, the structure was a simple wooden shelter for storing old pots and tools. Although I had rushed in, I paused at the threshold, captivated by the scene unfolding before me.",1
"""You’re youthful, Anne, and possess a striking beauty that drives men to madness. The world lies ahead of you, filled with love, life, and endless possibilities. Whereas mine is a scorched wasteland, tainted with bitter ashes.” “If you no longer desire me” “You know I crave you. I would willingly sacrifice my soul to hold you in my arms and shelter you from the world forever. Anne, you are a temptation. Your enchanting witch-like hair, your eyes that shimmer with golden, brown, and green hues, always laughing even when your expression is serious. However, I will protect you from both yourself and me. You must leave tonight.""",1
"“Let’s say she’s unable to provide one?”  “What? You just claimed she’s completely sound.” “She is. But, if you’re after details prior to May 7, 1915, she won’t be of much help.” They stared at the small man, dumbfounded. He nodded, smiling. “It’s unfortunate,” he commented. “Especially since, Sir James, this seems to be a significant matter. But, alas, she has no recollection of it.” “But how? Why, man? Come on, why?” The small man turned his kind gaze towards the agitated young American. “Because Janet Vandemeyer is experiencing total amnesia.” “What?” “That’s right.”",1
"""When did you bring it up last night?” “Around quarter-past seven, I believe, sir.” “Did you carry it straight from the kitchen to her room?” “No, sir. The gas stove doesn't have much space, so the cook made it early, before starting on the vegetables for supper. I would bring it up and place it on the table near the swing door, then take it into her room later.” “The swing door is in the left wing, correct?” “Yes, sir.” “Is the table on this side of the door, or on the servants' side?” “It's on this side, sir.” “And what time did you take it into her room last night?” “Around quarter-past seven, I would say, sir.”",1
"Whittington and his companion engaged in a heated discussion.  ""Why not, my friend?"" he chuckled. ""Mr. Brown is a common name, chosen for its respectability, no doubt."" Whittington's voice turned cold as he said, ""You may have already crossed paths with him."" The man scoffed, dismissing it as a mere police fable.  ""But what if he's a creation of the Inner Ring, a myth to keep us in line?"" he pondered. Whittington mused, ""It's possible that he walks among us, hidden from view."" ""And if so,"" the man added, ""he guards his secret well.""",1
"We stood face to face, locked in a fierce gaze of animosity. It was the first time I truly observed his features - the closely cropped dark hair, the angular jawline, the scar on his tan cheek, and his piercing light grey eyes that held a hint of reckless disdain. There was an undeniable air of danger that surrounded him. ""You haven't even said thank you for me saving your sorry life,"" I taunted with feigned sweetness, delivering a blow that made him visibly recoil. I sensed his deep aversion to acknowledging his debt to me, but I relished in his discomfort. The desire to inflict pain upon him consumed me like never before. ""I wish you weren't around to save me in the first place!"" he exclaimed with explosive frustration.",1
"As I stepped out of the train onto Adderly Street, a sense of unease settled over me. I could feel the eyes of my watcher boring into the back of my head, a constant reminder of the danger that surrounded me. I knew I couldn't continue to play the game alone - my enemies were too numerous and too close. The time had come to change my tactics. Sitting down at Cartwright's, I ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas, finding solace in the sweet, cold liquid as I contemplated my next move. A man might have turned to a stiff drink for courage, but for me, the comfort of an ice-cream soda was enough to steady my nerves. With each sip, I steeled myself for the challenges that lay ahead.",1
"I witnessed the figure recoil, arm raised, before a thick cloud of smoke enveloped me, suffocating and overwhelming. I plummeted into darkness, the grip of death tightening around me. Gradually, I regained consciousness, my senses reeling. Poirot's concerned face greeted me as I awoke, relief flooding his features at my recovery. ""You're back, my friend, all is well!"" he exclaimed. ""Where am I?"" I managed to croak. ""Here, with me,"" he reassured. Taking in my surroundings, I realized I was back in the comfort of my own home.",1
"From a compartment hidden in the wall, he retrieved a silenced pistol and carefully tucked it into the waistband of his pants. ""Now, we're prepared. I wouldn't dare venture out without you, Miss Montgomery."" She nodded in agreement, her eyes reflecting determination. ""However, I suggest that Mr. Reynolds stays behind. It's too dangerous, and he looks like he could use some rest."" But to their astonishment, Reynolds adamantly refused. ""No way. I'm part of this too. Those documents are my responsibility. I need to see this through to the finish.""",1
"""Informant, I must insist."" We had reached the stairs leading to the entrance of the Mansion. Inside, another officer was waiting. When the chief arrived, he asked for the whereabouts of Mr. Hautet. ""He's in the living room, sir."" Mr. Bex opened a door on the right, and we followed. Mr. Hautet and his assistant were seated at a large rectangular table. They glanced over as we stepped in. The chief introduced us and explained the reason for our visit. Mr. Hautet, the Investigating Judge, was a tall man with sharp eyes and a well-groomed grey beard that he stroked while speaking.",1
"I caught a glimpse of Table Mountain as the Kilmorden sailed into Table Bay. The morning sunlight bathed the town below, creating a magical sight. It took my breath away, filling me with a longing for something beautiful. The peaceful moment was interrupted by the presence of another figure on deck, absorbed in the view. I immediately recognized him. The events of the previous night seemed exaggerated in the light of day, making me feel a twinge of embarrassment.",1
"""Really?” “Yes, my dear Watson.” The revelation left me stunned. Holmes maintained a calm demeanor. “The detective inspector is clearly unaware of the true value. But chaos will ensue soon!” “Let's go!” I exclaimed, pulling at his coat sleeve. “Where to?” “We need to inform the Smithsons immediately.” “I disagree.” “What about the victim?” “Well; the victim, as you refer to her, will sleep soundly tonight thinking the treasures are secure.” “But the criminal might get away!” “Once again, my dear Watson, you jump to conclusions. How can you be certain the diamonds Mrs. Smithson...”",1
"The run-down mansion known as The Laurels sat back from the street, its unkempt bushes barely hiding the facade of a front yard. After settling the taxi fare, Tommy walked Tuppence to the entrance and stopped her just before she could ring the doorbell. ""What's your plan?"" he inquired. ""My plan? Oh, I suppose I'll just wing it. It's a bit tricky,"" Tuppence replied. ""I had a feeling,"" Tommy smirked. ""Typical woman! No preparation! Step aside and watch how a man handles this."" With a satisfied grin, he pushed the doorbell.",1
"”Pondering the new realm of possibilities unveiled by Poirot’s deductions, I reflected on his enigmatic references to the flower bed and wrist watch. Initially seeming insignificant, his comments now revealed his astute unraveling of the mystery at hand. I silently praised my friend’s methodical approach, which he acknowledged with a wise nod. “Method is key,” he affirmed. “Organize your facts, organize your thoughts. And if a detail seems out of place, scrutinize it instead of dismissing it.”",1
"He had overheard or witnessed something that deeply impacted him, but what could it be? I typically don't consider myself oblivious, yet I must admit that nothing unusual had caught my eye. Suddenly, the door swung open and in walked Dorcas. ""Mr. Wells is here to see you, sir,"" she informed John. The name rang a bell - he was the lawyer mentioned in Mrs. Inglethorp's letter the previous night. John stood up promptly. ""Lead him to my study."" Then, addressing us, he added, ""This is my mother's lawyer."" Speaking more quietly, he added, ""Keep in mind, he's also the Coroner.""",1
"""My interest was piqued when Annie mentioned finding something suspicious in Mrs. Inglethorp's nightly cocoa. I managed to obtain a sample of the cocoa and had it analyzed."" ""But wasn't that already done by Dr. Bauerstein?"" Lawrence interjected. ""Not quite. He only had it tested for strychnine, whereas I had it tested for a narcotic."" ""A narcotic?"" ""Yes, here is the analyst's report. Mrs. Cavendish gave both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle Cynthia a safe, yet potent, narcotic.""",1
"He was impeccably attired in a deep navy suit, impeccably tailored yet showing signs of wear. His contorted face revealed the agony he must have endured before his untimely demise. A gleaming black dagger protruded from his left side, directly over his heart. To my horror, I realized it was the same weapon I had seen the day before, resting innocently in a glass jar. ""The doctor will be here soon,"" Giraud stated calmly. ""But really, there's no need. It's quite clear how this man met his end. He was stabbed through the heart, a fatal blow that would have killed him instantly."" I inquired about the timing of the murder. ""Was it last night?"" Giraud shook his head. ""No, not likely.""",1
"""He can take on any role he desires."" Reflecting on past experiences, the asylum caretaker, the butcher's assistant, and the charming doctor all seemed to be the same person, yet so different from one another. ""It's truly remarkable,"" I finally remarked. ""Everything just falls into place. Savaronoff must have suspected the scheme, which is why he was so opposed to the game."" Poirot remained silent as he gazed at me. Abruptly, he turned away and started pacing back and forth. ""Do you happen to have a book on chess, my friend?"" he inquired out of the blue. ""I believe I may have one somewhere.""",1
"""Now that I'm done here, whose desk is that in the corner?"" ""Mr. Inglethorp's."" He tested the roll top cautiously. ""Locked. Maybe one of Mrs. Inglethorp's keys will work."" After trying a few, he exclaimed in satisfaction. ""There we go! Not the right key, but it'll do."" Sliding back the roll top, he quickly scanned the orderly papers inside. Surprisingly, he didn't inspect them, just nodding in approval as he locked the desk again. ""Clearly, Mr. Inglethorp is a man of method.""",1
"""Now, based solely on the information we have discussed, I estimate the time of death to be the morning of June 7th."" His words left me in shock. ""How could you possibly be certain?"" I questioned. ""The only way to make sense of the sequence of events is by this conclusion. I have guided you through the facts, can you not see the truth now?"" ""I'm afraid I'm still lost,"" I admitted. Poirot's expression turned melancholic. ""It is truly unfortunate. Your intellect shows promise, yet lacks the necessary structure.""",1
"Then he prowled the room like a mysterious feline, moving cautiously and gracefully, on high alert for any signs of danger. I observed him closely, staying obediently in my designated spot by the wall. ""Everything's fine, Poirot,"" I exclaimed with impatience. ""Seems so, my friend, seems so. But let's double-check."" ""Nonsense,"" I retorted. ""I'll light the fire regardless and enjoy a smoke. I've got you this time. You were the last one with the matches and failed to return them to their usual spot, the very habit you're always scolding me for."" I reached out my hand. Suddenly, Poirot's warning shout rang out as I saw him lunging towards me, just as my hand grasped the matchbox.",1
"The valet was surprised by the card's quality in Mr. Opalsen's possession. Poirot expressed his gratitude before the valet left, casting a curious look at the mess in the room. Poirot mused aloud about the heavily insured necklace as he tidied up the papers. ""And the necklace was heavily insured..."" I exclaimed, but Poirot shut me down. ""You see nothing, my friend,"" he retorted. ""As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us go back to our rooms.""",1
"""Giraud, the renowned Giraud, chuckles inwardly, underestimating the old man. But time will reveal the truth..."" My focus shifted back to the crucial details. ""So, the masked men - all a fabrication?"" ""Indeed."" ""Then what truly transpired?"" Poirot simply shrugged. ""Only Madame Renauld knows. Yet, she remains silent. A woman of exceptional fortitude, Hastings. From the moment I laid eyes on her, I sensed her uncommon resilience. Initially, I suspected her involvement in the crime. However, my perspective evolved over time.""",1
"“He will likely remain unconscious for a minimum of seven days.” Denise and Françoise rushed to their mistress, and with them in charge, Poirot departed the residence. His head was bowed, brows furrowed in deep thought as he stared at the ground. I held my tongue for a while, but eventually mustered the courage to ask him a question. “Despite all the evidence pointing otherwise, do you think there’s a possibility that Jack Renauld is innocent?” Poirot stayed silent for a moment, then finally spoke with seriousness in his tone: “I cannot say for certain, Hastings. But there is a slim chance.”",1
"Two idlers in grimy blue shirts were the outcome. We dined in a secluded inn, then headed back to Paris. It was almost eleven when we returned to the vicinity of Madame Olivier's residence. Scanning the area, we entered the alleyway. The entire area seemed eerily empty. We were confident that we were not being followed. ""I don't anticipate their arrival just yet,"" Poirot murmured. ""It's possible they might not show up until tomorrow night, but they are aware that there are only two nights when the radium will be present."" With great care, we unlocked the garden gate.",1
"""Can you state your business quickly?"" ""Might be an all-night job if you catch on."" ""Very well, Ivan. I won't need you again tonight. Enjoy a night off at the theater."" ""Thank you, your excellency."" The secretary bowed and left. Julius watched him go before closing the door with a satisfied sigh. Returning to the center of the room, he addressed Mr. Hersheimmer. ""Now, perhaps you can get to the point?"" ""I suppose that won't take long,"" drawled Julius.",1
"I found a wallet containing a few notes and a couple of unimportant letters, along with a roll of films that I seemed to have misplaced later. There was also a scrap of paper with a meeting scheduled for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my rush to depart without being caught, I accidentally dropped the paper, but thankfully I memorized the details. After quickly removing my disguise in the nearest cloak-room to avoid suspicion, I headed back to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still at lunch, oblivious to my presence. I won't go into the specifics of how I tailed her to Marlow.",1
"""Are you Hassan, the former servant of Sir John Willard?"" ""I was in service to Sir John, now I am in service to his son."" He moved closer, speaking softly. ""You have a reputation for knowledge in the supernatural. Advise the young master to leave. There is malevolence surrounding us."" Without waiting for a response, he walked away abruptly. ""Malevolence in the air,"" murmured Poirot. ""I sense it too."" Our dinner was somber. Dr. Tosswill dominated the conversation with a lecture on ancient Egyptian artifacts.",1
"I simply requested daily reports and obedience to my wired instructions, to which you agreed. Shortly after, I found myself across from Mr. Havering on a first-class carriage of the Midland Railway, swiftly departing from London. Firstly, Captain Hastings, it is essential that you grasp the fact that Hunter’s Lodge, the location of the tragic event, is merely a small shooting-box nestled in the Derbyshire moors. Our primary residence is near Newmarket, while we typically lease a flat in town during the season.",1
"""She appears to be experiencing some sort of seizure. Regrettably, she has barricaded herself inside."" ""I will be there immediately."" I jumped out of bed, threw on a robe, and trailed Lawrence through the hallway and into the right wing of the estate. John Cavendish accompanied us, while a few servants watched in a state of fearful anticipation. Lawrence looked to his brother. ""What is our next move?"" It was clear to me that his lack of decisiveness was on full display. John aggressively shook the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp's door, yet it remained securely shut.",1
"Three additional days passed in idle stagnation. Tommy's nerves were fraying under the pressure. His only companions were Conrad and Annette, the latter now silent and withdrawn. Her eyes held a shadow of suspicion. The prolonged isolation was driving Tommy to the brink of insanity. Conrad hinted that they awaited instructions from ""Mr. Brown."" Tommy speculated that perhaps he was out of town, forcing them to delay. However, the third evening shattered that illusion. Before seven o'clock, the sound of footsteps echoed down the passage.",1
"I was vehemently against the idea of educating women. My belief was that females should focus on household chores and manual labor, rather than wasting time on academic pursuits. This viewpoint clashed with the upbringing my uncle intended for me, causing me great frustration and anger. Despite his insistence, I refused to comply. I was well aware of my intellectual capabilities and had no interest in menial tasks. Our relationship was strained by our opposing views, leading to numerous heated debates. Although we cared for each other deeply, our stubbornness was a constant source of conflict.",1
"""Excuse me, we French do not hold back our admiration for beauty like the English do. Although, I must clarify that I am Belgian,"" he stated. ""I have visited Ostend,"" Miss Monro replied. The situation was progressing smoothly, just as Poirot would have predicted. ""Can you provide us with information about Mr. Claud Darrell?"" Poirot inquired. ""I was acquainted with Mr. Darrell for a period of time,"" the woman disclosed. ""Upon seeing your advertisement, and currently being unemployed, I thought to myself: Perhaps this is an opportunity to uncover the truth about poor old Claudie and potentially claim an inheritance, I should act on it immediately."" Mr. McNeil stood up.",1
"""She asked me feebly, 'What do you think?' I replied, 'Of the arrest?' She remained cold and expressionless. Did she care, or did she not? Moving away, she fingered a flower vase. 'These are quite dead. I must do them again.' With a nod of dismissal, she walked past me out of the window. No, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her part with that icy unconcern. Poirot did not show up the next morning, and the Scotland Yard men were nowhere to be seen.""",1
"""Upon receiving a gesture from the man lounging on the couch, my two guards escorted me back to my original spot across from him. ""You possess courage, Captain Hastings,"" he remarked. ""We of the East admire bravery. I must admit, I anticipated your actions. This brings us to the next phase of our little performance. You have already confronted death for yourself - will you do the same for another?"" ""What are you suggesting?"" I inquired in a hoarse voice, a sense of dread washing over me. ""Surely you haven't overlooked the woman who is under our control - the Rose of the Garden."" I gazed at him in silent anguish.""",1
""" She vanished. As I overheard hushed chatter in the adjacent room, she reappeared shortly after, gesturing for us to proceed into the connecting chamber. The man resting on the chaise was an imposing presence. Towering, skeletal, sporting large unruly brows and a white beard, his countenance worn from deprivation and suffering. Dr. Savaronoff possessed a unique aura. I observed the distinctive shape of his skull, its remarkable height. A master chess player must possess a superior intellect, I reasoned. It made perfect sense that Dr. Savaronoff was ranked as the world's second best player. Poirot nodded respectfully. ""Monsieur le Docteur, could I have a word with you in private?"" Savaronoff turned to his niece.",1
"With a quick gesture, the woman grabbed a large black velvet cat that was hiding the telephone. ""The documents are hidden in the lining of this,"" she revealed. ""Impressive,"" Poirot whispered admiringly as he stepped away from the door. ""Good evening, madame. I will keep your New York friend occupied while you escape."" ""Idiot!"" shouted the Italian man, raising his gun and firing at the woman as she fled, prompting me to tackle him to the ground.",1
"""But what was the true intent? What was the real purpose scheduled for one o’clock in Cabin 17? It couldn't have been the secretary's stabbing. Scheduling it for a specific hour on a specific day in a specific location would serve no purpose. No, it must have been some sort of meeting and he was en route to attend it when he was attacked. But who was the meeting with? Definitely not with you. It could have been with Chichester. Or perhaps with Pagett.” “That doesn't seem likely,” I interjected, “they could meet at any time.” We both fell silent for a couple of minutes, then Suzanne veered off in a different direction.",1
"She always wore elevator shoes to appear taller, and the wig and glasses added an extra layer of disguise. Drawing from her time working in hospitals, she understood how easily a nurse could go unnoticed when not in uniform. ""Perfect,"" she thought, glancing at her reflection in the mirror. After that, she went back to her usual look. Dinner that evening was a quiet affair. Tuppence couldn't help but wonder why Tommy hadn't come back yet. Julius's absence, on the other hand, seemed logical enough to her.",1
"""However, the question remained - why the sudden silence from him on such a crucial issue? It was clear that Marthe had been aware from the start, explaining her anxiety and persistent inquiries to Poirot regarding any suspects. Lost in thought, I was brought back to reality by the sound of the approaching train, and soon enough Poirot was before me. His face was aglow with excitement, his joy palpable as he embraced me warmly, disregarding my typical English reserve. 'My dear friend, I have triumphed beyond measure!' he exclaimed. 'Really? That's wonderful news,' I replied, genuinely pleased.""",1
"Poirot calmly analyzed the situation as Japp burst in with a sense of urgency. There was a burglary, jewels and money involved, and the culprit seemed to have made a clever escape plan. Poirot, with his keen eye for detail, explained his theory while enjoying his breakfast. Japp pressed for answers on the whereabouts of the criminal. Poirot, unfazed, hinted at a hiding place that showcased the brilliance of the criminal mind. The conversation turned to the best escape strategy, with Poirot's companions offering their opinions.",1
"""The short man grabbed me, shoved a gag in my mouth, and tied me up with rope. Meanwhile, the other man menaced my husband with a dagger. They dragged him into the dressing-room, speaking in a foreign language. They demanded something from him, grew angry, and searched for keys. They found money, but not what they wanted. Eventually, they forced my husband to dress and took him away. There was no other exit from the room. My husband reassured me before they left, but I could see the fear in his eyes. I must have fainted, and when I came to, Léonie was there.""",1
"Poirot arrived at Lawrence's house in the evening and discovered Lawrence's mistress writing letters. When questioned about the letters' recipients, Lawrence claimed ignorance due to being out that evening. Poirot asked Dorcas, the maid, about the letters but instructed her to leave them for further examination. Dorcas mentioned she left around six o'clock, prompting Poirot to thank her and end the conversation. Afterward, Poirot got up and casually walked over to the window.",1
"I returned from France with her that day, and said goodbye to her at Victoria that evening making it impossible for her to be in Merlinville.” Poirot gave me a thoughtful look. “Would you swear to that in a court of law?” “Absolutely,” I replied. Poirot stood up and nodded. “My friend! Love conquers all! Your plan is quite clever. It even outsmarts Hercule Poirot!” After a period of tension, as I have just described, there is always a moment of relief. I went to bed that night feeling victorious, only to wake up realizing that I was not yet in the clear. Although, I couldn't find any flaws in the alibi I had come up with so suddenly.",1
"""I wandered aimlessly, completely unaware that I was pushing the poor girl to her breaking point. Had she succeeded in stabbing me, I would have had it coming. Her bravery in coming forward now is truly admirable. I was prepared to face the consequences, right until the very end."" There was a brief pause before he changed the subject: ""What baffles me is why the Governor was wandering around in his undergarments and my coat in the dead of night.""",1
"As soon as I laid eyes on the lifeless body, a chilling resemblance to Jack sent shivers down my spine. Draped in Jack's elegant overcoat, the deceased also clutched the very same paper-knife he had gifted Bella. Odds were high that her fingerprints still lingered on its sharp edge. The sheer terror of the situation overwhelmed me, leaving me with only one clear thought - secure the dagger and disappear before its absence was noticed. Feigning a fainting spell, I seized the weapon while you fetched water, concealing it within the folds of my dress.",1
"A large settee covered in chintz was positioned against the far wall, while the window seats were also draped in the same faded fabric. Poirot, cigarette in hand, emphasized the need to meticulously search the room for clues, particularly in the desk. The key to the desk, labeled in a messy handwriting, raised suspicions. After questioning the Bakers, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen from Plymouth to create a hidden compartment in the fireplace. Coghan, one of the workers, disclosed the intricate details of the job. Excitedly, Poirot and I returned to explore the hidden cavity.",1
"""I don't believe that,” Poirot said with a mysterious grin. “I know it's the hair of a woman, and not just any woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I declared confidently. “Maybe,” Poirot replied, giving me a curious look. I kept my composure. “What's our next move?” I inquired, as we stepped into the foyer of the Villa Geneviève. “I plan to investigate M. Jack Renauld's belongings. That's why I needed to keep him occupied for a while.” “Won't Giraud have already done a search?” I questioned skeptically. “Certainly.",1
"Renauld plans to disguise himself as a tramp and leave town unnoticed after the crime is supposed to have taken place. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, leaving her with the same story as before. He intentionally leaves evidence against himself and is ultimately caught. Poirot praises Renauld's wife for her strength and resilience in the face of tragedy. Poirot and Hastings discuss the case further, focusing on the lead piping and the possibility of a witness. They travel to England to find Bella Duveen, a potential key witness. They track her down to a theater in Coventry, where she performs as part of the Dulcibella Kids act.",1
"""He confessed to getting involved with a dangerous crowd, mentioning the elusive 'Colonel' for the first time. Carton insisted that he had never been part of any criminal activity before, a claim I was tentatively accepting. However, there was a lingering suspicion that he was withholding information. To provoke a reaction, I threatened him with a gun, claiming I no longer cared about the consequences. In a panic, he revealed more unsettling details.""",1
"The Big Four were meticulous in their attention to detail. Returning home, I was left with a sense of unease. The countess's chatter had revealed a chilling truth - my life was at risk. Determined not to give up, I knew I had to tread carefully and take every possible precaution. As I pondered my next move, the telephone suddenly rang. I hurried to answer it. ""Hello. Who is this?"" A sharp voice responded. ""This is St. Giles' Hospital calling. We have a Chinese man here, attacked and brought in from the streets.""",1
"John's voice could be heard from outside. She placed her hand on the door handle, turning to gesture to me. ""Mr. Hastings, keep an eye on her husband,"" she urged. Miss Howard was quickly enveloped in a flurry of farewells and objections. The Inglethorps were nowhere to be seen. As the car departed, Mrs. Cavendish broke away from the crowd, crossing the driveway to greet a tall man with a beard who was headed towards the house. A blush crept into her cheeks as she reached out her hand to him. ""Who is he?"" I inquired sharply, a sense of unease settling in.",1
"Three deaths linger as a dark omen over the unfolding events in Egypt. Lady Willard expresses her deep fear for her son, who is determined to continue his father's work amidst the lurking shadows of the past. Poirot, surprisingly superstitious, vows to protect the young man from any unseen harm. The mysterious deaths of Mr. Bleibner and Mr. Schneider raise suspicions of foul play, leading Poirot and Hastings to embark on a journey to uncover the truth. As they delve deeper into the secrets of the expedition, they encounter a web of deceit and danger that threatens to consume them all.",1
"""In the first scene, there were clear impressions left by the suspect's heavy boots, but in the second scene, not a single mark! It's clear that someone deliberately tried to cover their tracks by smoothing out the bed with a rake.""""Where would they have found a rake?""""The same place they found the shovel and gardening gloves,"" Poirot replied impatiently. ""That shouldn't be hard to figure out.""""But why do you think they exited that way? Isn't it more likely they came in through the window and left through the door?""""Of course, that's a possibility. But my gut tells me they made their escape through the window.""""I disagree with you.""""Perhaps you're right, my friend. But my instincts tell me otherwise.""",1
"Tommy's scheme to eliminate the unattractive Conrad flashed in his mind too late. As Tommy braced himself for Conrad's entrance, he was surprised to see a girl instead. She placed a tray on the table before him, her beauty captivating him in the dim gas light. Tommy was entranced by her full, rich brown hair, with hints of golden sunlight reflecting from within. Her face possessed a wild-rose quality that left Tommy spellbound.",1
"""They couldn't have been concealed on board and we know they weren't because they were put up for sale shortly after the Olympia docked, well before I initiated the search and sent out the descriptions. One dealer claims he purchased some even before the ship arrived. But you can't transmit bonds via radio waves."" ""Not through radio waves, but did any tugboat approach?"" ""Just the authorized ones, and that was after the alarm was raised when everyone was vigilant. I was personally on the lookout for any exchange happening that way. Dear heavens, Monsieur Poirot, this situation is maddening! People are starting to accuse me of taking them myself.""",1
"""They fail to grasp that with my extensive experience as an investigating magistrate, I possess a certain level of insight, a certain intuition. Indeed! I much prefer the courteous manners of the past. So, my dear colleague, do not hesitate to give me any orders. We are both quite knowledgeable, aren't we?"" chuckling heartily, M. Hautet bid us farewell. Regrettably, Poirot's initial comment to me as we walked through the hallway was: ""That renowned old fool! Utterly foolish!"" Just as we exited the premises, we encountered Giraud, looking even more fashionable than before, and thoroughly content with himself.",1
"They work together to pull him into the barn where the incident took place right outside. They immediately recognize the incredible opportunity that has presented itself. Although the man looks nothing like M. Renauld, he is a middle-aged, typical Frenchman. This will do. ""I suspect they sat on the nearby bench, away from the house, talking in private. They quickly devised a plan. The key to the identification will be based entirely on Madame Renauld's testimony. Jack Renauld and the loyal chauffeur (who had served his master for two years) need to be removed from the equation.""",1

Race was made to tell the story of the diamond heist all over again. Why are women so fascinated by anything to do with diamonds? Finally, Anne Beddingfeld has revealed her true identity. It turns out she’s a journalist. She sent a lengthy cable from De Aar this morning. Based on the non-stop chatter that echoed through Mrs. Blair’s cabin almost all night, she must have been reciting all her exclusive articles for years to come.",1
"In the meantime, the Young Explorers sat rigidly in a taxi on their way back to the Ritz through Regent’s Park. An uncomfortable silence hung between them, replacing their usual camaraderie. Tuppence and Tommy struggled to find words, sitting upright and avoiding eye contact. Finally, Tuppence broke the silence, ""That was quite the adventure, wasn't it?"" ""Indeed, quite.""",1
"Inglethorp, who was involved in the altercation. He believed the situation had been distorted. The true sequence of events unfolded like this. Upon his return to the residence on Tuesday night, the accused was informed with certainty that a heated argument had taken place between Mr. and Mrs. Inglethorp. It never crossed the accused's mind that someone could have mistakenly identified his voice as Mr. Inglethorp's. His assumption was that his stepmother had engaged in two disputes. The prosecution claimed that on Monday, July 16th, the accused had visited the local pharmacist's store in disguise, posing as Mr.",1
"Arriving at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.” “Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s only that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself all right.” Poirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked himself.",1
"""Poirot is in charge of operations outside. Before I joined the others on the terrace, I applied aniseed to my boots. Hounds are on the trail, heading towards the rock in the Felsenlabyrynth. The net is closing in on you, there's no way out,"" Madame Olivier chuckled. ""Actually, there is a way to escape and take down our enemies, just like Samson. What do you think?"" Ryland looked at Achille Poirot suspiciously. ""What if he's deceiving us?"" he whispered. Poirot simply raised his shoulders. ""Dawn is only an hour away.""",1
"""But I couldn't help but raise one final concern: “What about the match and cigarette end discovered near the victim's body? How do you explain that?” Poirot's face instantly brightened with amusement. “Planted! Clearly planted there as a deliberate ploy for Giraud or one of his associates to stumble upon! Giraud may be cunning, but he's no match for my intellect. He struts in, proud of his discovery. After hours of crawling on his belly, he presents his findings. ‘Look what I have uncovered,’ he boasts. And then he turns to me, eagerly awaiting my response: ‘What do you make of this scene?’ And I, with unwavering honesty, reply, ‘Nothing.’""",1
"We were led quickly up the hill through the dense forest, until we reached the open mountain-side. Before us stood a peculiar collection of rocks and boulders, the mysterious Felsenlabyrynth that Harvey had mentioned. As we navigated through its winding passages, it felt like we were trapped in a maze created by a malevolent force. Our progress came to a sudden halt when we encountered a massive rock blocking our way.",1
"""His plan, from what I gathered, involved assigning her enough tasks to keep her glued to her desk in her designated area all day long."" I chuckled. Later, along with the other two, I located Sir Eustace. He paced back and forth in the confined area, bombarding the hapless secretary, who I noticed for the first time. A tall, angular woman in plain attire, sporting spectacles and a businesslike demeanor. It seemed she struggled to keep up with Sir Eustace, as her pencil raced across the paper, her brow furrowed in concentration. I entered the compartment. ""Welcome aboard, sir,"" I quipped.",1
"Poirot's smile broadened as he looked at me, a quizzical expression on his face. ""A penny for your thoughts,"" I joked, trying to lighten the mood. He reminded me of my initial plan to stay in the country for only a couple of months when I first arrived at midsummer. I felt awkward as I struggled to recall making such a statement. ""Did I say that?"" I asked, unsure. But Poirot was certain. ""You did, mon ami. You have changed your plan since then, haven't you?"" I hesitated before finally admitting, ""Er yes, I have.""",1
"Poirot and I arrived in Saint-Omer, where Jack Renauld was being held. The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, welcomed us and expressed his frustration with the clever but rude detective Giraud. Poirot remained cautious, not revealing his suspicions about the case. The magistrate mentioned that Jack had been uncooperative and silent during questioning. Madame Renauld, still unconscious, was in a delicate state. As we discussed the case, M. Hautet remembered a letter for Poirot that had arrived earlier. It was from an unknown woman, written in a flowing foreign hand. Poirot pocketed the letter, thanked the magistrate, and we left the room.",1
"This made me ponder intensely, leading me to the realization that Alfred Inglethorp seemed to desire being taken into custody. However, I was resolute in ensuring that he would not face arrest. ""But why would he want to be arrested?"" I questioned. Poirot explained, ""In your country, once a man is acquitted, he cannot be retried for the same crime. It was a cunning plan on his part, demonstrating his methodical nature.""",1
"The sound he made was deafening. Soon, a flawless butler, followed by an equally impeccable footman, emerged from the entrance. The butler scolded him. Tommy kept on singing, calling the butler ""my dear old friend."" The footman grasped one of his arms, the butler the other. They escorted him down the driveway, and smoothly out the gate. The butler warned him about involving the authorities if he returned. It was executed flawlessly, with dignity and composure.",1
"“Have you heard of anyone by the name of ‘Duveen’?” Mrs. Renauld paused before responding, “Duveen? No, I can’t say that I have.” Poirot pressed on, “Has your husband ever mentioned anyone by that name?” “Never,” she replied firmly. “Do you know anyone named Bella?” Poirot observed Mrs. Renauld closely for any reaction, but she simply shook her head. Undeterred, he continued, “Did you know that your husband had a visitor last night?” A hint of color rose in her cheeks, but she asked calmly, “Oh, did he? Who was it?” “A lady,” Poirot revealed.",1
"“Did Renauld come by? I hold a great deal of respect and fondness for that woman; she’s an incredibly remarkable and unique individual, but I fail to see how my opinions, one way or another, could impact her?” “What if this Bella Duveen turns out to have been more than just a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” Stonor exclaimed. “I understand now. But I am willing to wager that you are mistaken. The old man never even glanced at another woman. He was completely devoted to his wife. They were the most loyal couple I have ever known.” M. Hautet shook his head subtly. “M. Stonor, we have concrete evidence of a love letter from this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of growing tired of her.”",1
"""There were moments when I questioned whether Poirot truly valued my abilities. “Indeed,” he mused, peering at me with discerning eyes, “your assistance will be indispensable.” I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride, yet Poirot’s subsequent words cast a shadow over my excitement. “I require a confidant within the household,” he remarked thoughtfully. “But you have me,” I interjected. “Yes, but that alone will not suffice,” Poirot responded. His words stung, and I couldn’t hide my disappointment. Sensing my reaction, Poirot hastened to clarify. “You misunderstand. Your affiliation with me is widely known. I need someone unconnected to our work.” “I understand now. What do you think of John?” Poirot shook his head, “No, I believe not.""",1
"“Ah, what an idea! You saw me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Well, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Combine those facts with another, that M. Jack Renauld rushed out of the house on his way to Paris, and tell me what you think!” “I understand,” I replied slowly, as Poirot’s words sank in. “That letter was meant for Jack Renauld, not his father. He mistakenly took the wrong overcoat in his haste and anxiety.” Poirot nodded. “Exactly! We can revisit this later.",1
"""But you're telling me it's been a week since the crime. That's more than enough time for him to get rid of any evidence."" ""Maybe."" ""It's not maybe, it's a fact. Would he have had the chance to remove everything?"" ""Yes."" ""Were the clothes covering the hidden items light or heavy?"" ""On the heavier side."" ""So it was winter clothing. It wouldn't make sense for the suspect to dig through that drawer, right?"" ""Probably not."" ""Just answer me this: Would someone in the middle of summer really bother looking through winter clothes? Yes or no?"" ""No.""",1
"Despite the recent betrayal, I knew the importance of monitoring his every move to protect Bella. Giraud and the French authorities showed no concern for her safety. It was crucial for me to stick close to Poirot at all times. His keen eyes caught my contemplative gaze, and he nodded in approval. ""You see the wisdom in my plan, don't you? Rather than risk you clumsily tailing me in a laughable disguise, let us journey together,"" he suggested.",1
"As he stood with his cap clutched in one hand, absentmindedly twirling it between his fingers, his posture hunched with age beyond his years. Despite his slow, deliberate speech, his eyes gleamed with intelligence. ""Manning,"" John addressed him, ""this gentleman has some questions for you. Please answer truthfully."" ""Yes, sir,"" Manning muttered. Poirot stepped into the conversation with purpose. Manning looked him over with a hint of disdain. ""You were tending to the begonias near the house's southern side yesterday afternoon, correct, Manning?"" ""Yes, sir, me and Willum,"" he replied. ""And Mrs.""",1
"""A person's profession is often reflected in their appearance,"" they say. ""He's a criminal,"" I exclaimed. ""He is skilled at deception."" ""It's essentially the same thing."" ""That's a broad generalization, Hastings, and one that the theater community would not appreciate. Can't you see that this man is, or has been, an actor at some point?"" ""An actor?"" ""Absolutely. He has all the skills at his disposal. There are two types of actors, those who lose themselves in a role, and those who leave their mark on it.""",1
"I'm hidden well here, I pray, but any moment they could capture me. The notorious gang, known as The Big Four, are after me. It's a matter of life and death. I have a stash of money, but I can't access it, afraid of tipping them off. Please send a couple of hundred in cash. I will repay you, I promise. Your humble servant, ""JONATHAN WHALLEY."" ""Received from Granite Bungalow, Hoppaton, Dartmoor. I must admit that I saw it as quite a bold attempt to swindle me out of a few hundred that I can't afford to lose. If it helps you in any way"" He handed it over. ""Thank you, sir.",1
"I wiped away my tears, feeling the lingering weakness in my body. Gripping his hand tightly, I wished for a peaceful death in that moment, under his watchful gaze. His eyes held a new intensity, a protective glint that soothed me. ""Please, Anne, no more tears. You're safe now,"" he reassured me, offering a cup of milk. I drank without hesitation, listening to his comforting words, spoken in a gentle, coaxing tone. ""Rest now, don't worry. Let your strength return. No need for questions."" And with that, I drifted back into slumber, feeling reassured by his presence.",1
"""Good gracious!"" exclaimed Poirot. ""I must speak to your Inspector immediately."" Within moments, we found ourselves in a meeting with Inspector Graves. Initially reserved, the mention of Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard paved the way for cooperation. ""Indeed, the victim was found dead this morning. A gruesome sight. The authorities in Moreton were alerted, prompting my swift arrival. The circumstances appeared puzzling at first. The deceased, a man in his seventies known for his love of alcohol, was discovered on the floor of his own living room. A head injury and a deep gash across his throat indicated a violent struggle. The scene was drenched in blood, a chilling spectacle to behold.""",1
"""Despite your insistence, I, Hercule Poirot, refuse to degrade myself by laying on the ground (perhaps on wet grass) to analyze imaginary footprints, or collecting cigarette ash without understanding the different types. Think back to the case of the Plymouth Express. Inspector Japp went off to inspect the railway tracks. Upon his return, I was able to accurately describe his findings without leaving my room.” “Are you suggesting that Japp's efforts were fruitless?” “On the contrary, his discoveries only served to support my deductions.""",1
"Inglethorp’s determination to nullify her will was a result of the afternoon quarrel, implying it occurred after the will was made. The dispute occurred after, not before, the will was created. At four o’clock, Dorcas overheard her mistress angrily stating: ‘You need not fear any scandal between husband and wife will stop me.’ I deduced, correctly, that these words were directed at Mr. John Cavendish, not her husband. An hour later, at five o’clock, she repeated similar words, but from a different perspective.",1
"""I could let you stay here and enjoy yourself. But the leaders are concerned that something you say might assist those with greater intelligence. That's why you're being sent away."" The countess seemed to hold a high opinion of my skills. I kept my irritation hidden. Clearly, she was pretending to belittle me in order to provoke me and make me feel insignificant. ""It would be simple to get rid of you,"" she added, ""but I can be sentimental at times. I interceded on your behalf. You have a loving wife somewhere, correct? It would bring comfort to the deceased man to know you were spared. I always had a soft spot for him, you see.""",1
"""Miss Marsh, do you have the will or a copy of it on hand?"" Poirot asked, accepting the document she handed him. After a quick review, he noted, ""This was made three years ago, on March 25 at 11 a.m. The timing is quite telling and limits our search. We must now look for another will. Even a will made just half-an-hour later would change everything. Well, mademoiselle, you have brought me a charming and clever problem to solve. I look forward to unraveling it for you.""",1
"Poirot muttered softly: ""Ah, c’est comme ça!"" Then, displaying his usual knack for accuracy (which he preferred to call psychology), he remarked, ""So you must be familiar with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?"" ""Gregory crossed paths with her during her time out West three years back,"" Miss Marvell revealed. After a brief pause, she blurted out, ""Do either of you follow Society Gossip?"" We both admitted guilt with a hint of embarrassment. ""I inquire because the latest issue features an article on renowned jewels, and it's quite intriguing,"" she trailed off.",1
"""But why Marlow?"" I questioned, feeling the weight of the circumstances pressing down on me. ""It was a mistake, but in the moment it felt right. It still feels right, given the circumstances."" ""What circumstances?"" I demanded, desperation creeping into my voice. Pagett finally turned his attention to me, realizing my inquiry. ""I apologize, Miss Beddingfeld,"" he responded coldly, ""but I fail to understand your involvement in this situation."" As he leaned in closer, I could sense my desperation growing.",1
"“It's your strikingly beautiful nature that caught my attention,” he said. “Oh,” I responded, slightly appeased. “I suppose I was hoping for a hint.” “But I did give you hints, my dear. Many hints. You simply chose to ignore them. Did I ever explicitly say that I thought John Cavendish was guilty? Didn't I actually suggest that he would likely be acquitted?” “Yes, but...” “And right after that, didn't I mention how challenging it would be to catch the real murderer? Wasn't it obvious that I was referring to two different individuals?” “No,” I admitted, “I didn't realize that!” “Furthermore,” Poirot added, “from the start, didn't I emphasize multiple times that I didn't trust Mr.",1
"""But she had a key with her. She was brutally killed, and the killer took the key from her bag. There may still be hope. He might not have found what he was looking for right away."" We arrived at the address provided by Flossie Monro, a rundown apartment building in a questionable part of town. It took some time to get into Miss Monro's apartment, but we made sure no one could escape while we waited outside. Finally, we gained entry. It was clear that someone had already searched the place. Drawers and cabinets were ransacked and their contents scattered across the floor.",1
"""Imagine, my dear friend, the actual rent for those apartments is £350. I just confirmed this with the landlord's agents. However, this specific apartment is being sublet for eighty pounds! Why is that?"" Poirot shook his head, clearly not satisfied. ""There must be some issue with it. Maybe it's haunted, like Mrs. Robinson suggested."" ""But don't you think it's possible that her friend simply went to the wrong apartment? That would explain everything.""",1
"""I never would have suspected it,"" Poirot remarked calmly, hiding any hint of disappointment. ""But now, I must inquire about another matter. Was there a saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp's chambers containing cocoa each night?"" ""Certainly, sir. It was delivered to her quarters nightly, and she would heat it whenever she desired."" ""And what was in this cocoa? Just plain cocoa powder?"" ""Indeed not, sir. It was prepared with milk, a spoonful of sugar, and a double spoonful of rum."" ""Who was responsible for delivering it to her room?"" ""That task fell to me, sir."" ""Consistently?"" ""Without fail, sir.""",1
"He strived increasingly to be recognized as a ""consulting detective,"" akin to a specialized Harley Street doctor. Unlike the human bloodhound archetype, he derided the practice of assuming elaborate disguises to track criminals and meticulously measuring footprints. ""No, my dear Hastings,"" he insisted; ""that is Giraud's domain. Hercule Poirot's approach is unique, relying on order, method, and 'the little gray cells.' From the comfort of our armchairs, we observe what others miss, refraining from hasty conclusions like Japp.""",1
"“Mr. Brown is a person of interest.” He glanced at Tommy. “Did you see where that wire was submitted?” “I’m sorry, sir, I didn’t catch that.” “Hmm. Do you have it on you?” “It’s upstairs, in my bag, sir.” “I’d like to examine it later. No rush. You’ve lost a week.” Tommy looked ashamed. “A few more days won’t matter. Let’s focus on finding Miss Jane Finn next. Then we’ll turn our attention to rescuing Miss Tuppence. As long as they are unaware of Jane Finn’s recovery and our possession of her, I believe Miss Tuppence is safe. Secrecy is crucial.”",1
"""Ah, Moosior Poirot, there you are. What do you need from me today? I thought you had plans to visit the coral shores of some faraway land.""  ""Japp, I need to know if you recognize this man."" Poirot led Japp into the bedroom, where the inspector gazed at the figure on the bed with a quizzical expression.  ""Hmm, he looks vaguely familiar, and I pride myself on having a good memory. Ah, it's Mayerling!""  ""And who exactly is Mayerling?""  ""He was a Secret Service agent, not one of ours. He disappeared in Russia five years ago. We suspected the Bolsheviks were behind it, but never found out for sure.""",1
"I had uncovered a murder at Marlow that was not the work of a lone perpetrator. The revelations from Colonel Race to Suzanne, along with what I had eavesdropped on in Muizenberg, shed light on the organized crime syndicate I was up against. This ""Colonel"" had his followers intricately involved in various illegal activities. Memories of conversations on the ship about the Rand strike and suspicions of a covert organization manipulating events came flooding back.",1
"""I have a few arrangements already in place. Release me, provide me with a head start, and I will leave behind a signed confession admitting to the murder of Nadina."" ""Absolutely, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He looked at me sternly. ""No, Anne, absolutely not. You don't know what you're suggesting."" ""I do. It's the perfect solution."" ""I could never face Race again. I'll take my chances, but I refuse to let this cunning old man slip away. It's not an option, Anne. I won't do it."" Sir Eustace chuckled, conceding defeat without any hint of emotion. ""Oh well,"" he commented.",1
"As we drove through the village, I remembered that I needed some stamps, so we made a quick stop at the post office. Exiting the building, I accidentally bumped into a man who was just stepping inside. After exchanging apologies, he suddenly embraced me and gave me a warm kiss. ""My dear friend, Hastings!"" he exclaimed. ""It is truly my dear friend, Hastings!"" ""Poirot!"" I gasped in surprise. I introduced him to Miss Cynthia who was waiting in the pony-trap. ""What a delightful coincidence, meeting Monsieur Poirot after all these years,"" I said. ""Oh, we are well acquainted with Monsieur Poirot,"" Cynthia chimed in.",1
"“Is the young lady doing well, sir?” “That’s the issue, Albert. She’s vanished.” “You mean the crooks have taken her?” “Yes.” “In the Underworld?” “No, in this world!” “It’s an expression, sir,” Albert clarified. “In the movies, the crooks always have a restaurant in the Underworld. But do you think they’ve harmed her, sir?” “I hope not. By the way, do you have any female relative who might be likely to pass away?” A pleased smile appeared on Albert’s face. “I understand, sir.”",1
"At the sensation of the icy water, he jolted awake and sat upright. ""Stay put, please,"" I instructed. He was the type of young man who recovered quickly from a shock. Pushing himself up, he stood unsteadily. ""No need for assistance, thank you,"" he declared defiantly, with a hint of aggression. Not a hint of gratitude or manners! ""That's quite a nasty gash. Let me help bandage it up."" ""Absolutely not,"" he retorted, throwing the words at me as if I had been the one asking for a favor. My temper, always simmering, began to boil.",1
"""I believe there's a room nearby where we can talk undisturbed,"" he suggested, leading the way. The group followed and settled in, the doctor turning to Sir James with a look of curiosity. ""Dr. Hall, I'm on a mission to locate a specific young woman in order to obtain a statement from her. I suspect she may have spent time at your facility in Bournemouth. I trust it's not inappropriate to inquire about this?"" After a brief pause, Sir James responded, ""It pertains to providing testimony, correct?"" ""Indeed,"" confirmed the doctor. ""I'm more than willing to share any relevant details I have.""",1
"""And that fool Giraud, crawling all over it in search of match ends! Didn't I mention that a clue of two feet long is just as valuable as a clue of two inches?"" ""Giraud will be humbled now,"" I quickly remarked, trying to divert attention from my mistakes. ""As I mentioned earlier, will he? If he has found the correct suspect using the wrong approach, he won't be bothered by that."" ""But of course"" I stopped as I noticed the shift in direction. ""You see, Hastings, we need to begin anew. Who murdered M. """,1
"""Much to my surprise, Cynthia couldn't contain her laughter and affectionately referred to me as a ""funny dear."" ""Your gesture is truly kind,"" she remarked, ""but deep down you know it's not what you truly desire."" ""On the contrary, I do. I have a strong desire for it,"" I insisted. ""Forget about your desires. It's not what you really want, and it's not what I want either."" ""Well, I suppose that settles it,"" I replied formally. ""But I fail to see the humor in this situation. A proposal is a serious matter."" ""Indeed,"" Cynthia agreed. ""Perhaps someone else will accept your proposal next time. Farewell, you've brought me much joy."" And with a final burst of laughter that she couldn't contain, she disappeared behind the trees.""",1
"Poirot calmly read through his correspondence. There was a request to give a lecture to boy scouts, a Countess wanting his visit, and then, a mysterious letter caught his attention. It was from a man in France, seeking a detective discreetly. Poirot accepted the case without hesitation, sensing urgency. The man, Mr. Renauld, needed help and was willing to pay any price. Poirot and his companion quickly prepared to leave for France, intrigued by the unusual nature of the case. They were off to solve the mystery in Merlinville, a place that held secrets waiting to be uncovered.",1
"“I couldn’t risk losing my position. A secretary like me isn’t supposed to have a spouse, so I kept it hidden.” “You surprise me,” I commented. “Where has she been all this time?” “We’ve had a small cottage by the river in Marlow, near the Mill House, for more than five years.” “Goodness gracious,” I muttered. “Do you have any children?” “Four children, Sir Eustace.” I stared at him in disbelief. I should have realized that someone like Pagett wouldn’t harbor a dark secret. Pagett’s respectable image has always been a thorn in my side.”",1
"""Oh, indeed he will comply. I shall procure for you glowing references that will surely pique his interest. Even the highest official in the land will vouch for you."" It seemed like a stretch, but Poirot dismissed my doubts. ""Absolutely, he will assist. I assisted him in a sensitive matter that could have led to a major scandal. I handled it discreetly and tactfully, and now, metaphorically speaking, he relies on me like a little bird perched on my hand, waiting for the crumbs."" Our initial move was to enlist the help of a makeup artist. He was a small man, with a peculiar bird-like mannerism, somewhat reminiscent of Poirot himself.",1
"""Did you notice Sir Eustace?"" I inquired. ""He stormed out of the dining area as we entered. He seemed to have eaten some spoiled fish and was expressing his dissatisfaction to the head waiter, even going so far as to bounce a peach on the ground to demonstrate its hardness, though it turned out to be softer than he anticipated and ended up getting squashed."" Suzanne grinned. ""Sir Eustace is not a fan of early mornings, much like myself. But, Anne, did you catch sight of Mr. Pagett? I bumped into him in the hallway. He had a bruised eye. What on earth could have happened to him?"" ""Perhaps he was attempting to push me into the water,"" I responded nonchalantly. It was a small victory for me.",1

"”I was led into a dingy apartment by him, a young Kafir boy carrying my small suitcase, while Sir Eustace, with a polite demeanor, offered to fulfill any of my requests before leaving. A can of steaming water sat on the washstand, prompting me to unpack my essentials. Among them, an unexpected item awaited me inside my sponge-bag - a small pearl-handled revolver. The loaded weapon surprised me, as it was not there when I departed from Kimberley. Despite my initial shock, I couldn't help but feel a sense of security holding it in my hands. In a place like this, such a tool could prove to be quite handy.”",1
"He appeared to be in his forties, with a hint of silver hair framing his temples, and undoubtedly the most handsome passenger on the ship. I inquired with the stewardess about the identity of the captivating lady beside me. ""That is the Honorable Mrs. Clarence Blair, a prominent figure in high society. Surely you have heard of her in the newspapers."" I acknowledged, studying her with a newfound curiosity. Mrs. Blair was renowned as one of the most fashionable women of her time. I couldn't help but notice that she was commanding a considerable amount of admiration.",1
"After careful consideration, it was decided that I would accompany Suzanne, no matter her location, and focus solely on my own well-being. It was imperative that I refrained from seeking out thrills or trying to outsmart the elusive “Colonel.” My task was to stay by her side and await further instructions from Harry. The precious diamonds were to be securely stored in the Bank at Kimberley under the alias of Parker. ""There's one aspect we must address,"" I pondered, ""we should establish a code of sorts. We must avoid falling for deceitful messages claiming to be from one another."" ""That's simple. Any communication legitimately from me will have the word 'and' crossed out.""",1
"""But was it Daniels or O’Murphy behind it all? One of them had to be involved, considering the car veered off the main road. It seems highly unlikely that the Prime Minister would be complicit in his own demise! Did O’Murphy make that fateful turn on his own, or was Daniels the mastermind behind it all?” “It appears more likely that O’Murphy was the culprit.” “Certainly, because if it had been Daniels, the Prime Minister would have overheard the command and inquired about the motive. Yet, there seems to be an abundance of unanswered questions in this case, each one contradicting the next.""",1
"""As we strolled down the scorching pavement, I felt compelled to address Poirot. ""I must admit, I have a bone to pick with you,"" I began, trying to maintain my composure. Poirot turned to me, a subtle look of curiosity in his eyes. ""And pray tell, how did you discover my visit to the Hôtel du Phare?"" he questioned. My cheeks flushed with irritation as I responded, ""I happened to glance inside as I walked by,"" trying to salvage some semblance of pride.""",1
"Tommy pondered his next move. He was determined to seek revenge on Mr. Brown, but beyond that, his plans were uncertain. Sir James's letter weighed heavily on his mind, reminding him of the need to avenge Tuppence. Tommy sighed and decided to answer the letter. However, he was frustrated to find a lack of paper in his room. Remembering Julius's sitting-room had a good supply, Tommy headed there, knowing he wouldn't run into the American who had just departed.",1
"“I regret to inform you, sir, that I have not succeeded.” Mr. Carter fixed him with a penetrating gaze. “You’re saying the treaty ” “Has fallen into the possession of Mr. Brown, sir.” “I see,” responded Mr. Carter calmly. His expression remained impassive, yet Tommy detected a glimmer of defeat in his eyes. It confirmed the futility of the situation more than anything else had. “Very well,” Mr. Carter remarked after a brief pause, “we cannot afford to lose hope. It’s good to have clarity. We must act accordingly.” Tommy couldn’t shake the certainty: “It’s a lost cause, and he acknowledges it’s a lost cause!” He met Mr. Carter’s gaze.",1
"""You were tormented with a falsehood!"" I averted my gaze. Poirot rested his hand on my shoulder. There was a new quality in his tone that caught my attention. ""I see you do not desire my embrace or a public show of emotion. I understand. I shall remain reserved. I will speak only to say nothing at all. Except to acknowledge that in our recent escapade, you are the true hero, and fortunate is the man who can call you friend!"" I felt let down by the outcome of Poirot's explosive assault on the establishment in Chinatown. For starters, the head of the criminal organization had managed to flee.",1
"""I must say, the masterminds behind this heinous act were incredibly thorough. The victim was pierced with his own blade and destined to rest with his own shovel. They were determined to erase all evidence! However, I refuse to be outwitted. There is always a clue to be found! And I will uncover it."" Poirot's attention seemed to shift to something else entirely - a small, discolored segment of lead piping resting near the shovel. He gently prodded it with his fingertip. ""Could this also be linked to the deceased?"" he inquired, his tone carrying a hint of sarcasm. Giraud simply shrugged, showing his indifference.",1
"""You demonstrated remarkable ingenuity and executed your role admirably,"" commended Tommy, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. ""I owe my escape to the girl, sir."" ""Indeed,"" Sir James responded with a faint smile. ""You were fortunate that she took a liking to you."" Tommy seemed inclined to object, but Sir James continued, ""Do you believe she is part of the criminal organization?"" ""Unfortunately, sir, I do. Although I initially suspected she was being held against her will, her behavior suggested otherwise. She willingly returned to them, despite having the opportunity to flee."" Sir James pondered this revelation.",1
"""Oh my, I've eaten so much!"" ""You've really indulged yourself! As did I, but I believe my food choices were more prudent than yours. Two coffees."" (Addressed to the waiter.) ""One Turkish, one French."" Tuppence leisurely sipped her coffee, deep in thought, and ignored Tommy when he tried to speak. ""Hush. I'm pondering."" ""Reminiscent of Pelmanism!"" remarked Tommy, before falling silent. ""There!"" exclaimed Tuppence after a while. ""I've devised a plan. Clearly, we need to delve deeper into this."" Tommy clapped in approval. ""Don't mock.""",1
"“Have you come to your senses yet? Where is the girl?” “She’s in Astley Priors, at Gatehouse in Kent.” “Is she being held against her will?” “She’s confined to the house, but it’s not dangerous. Unfortunately, she’s lost her memory.” “That must be frustrating for you and your associates. And what about the other girl you lured away a week ago?” “She’s also there,” replied the Russian gruffly. “Excellent,” Julius remarked. “Isn’t everything unfolding perfectly? And the perfect night for our escape!” “Escape?” Kramenin questioned, his gaze intense.",1
"“I can’t definitively determine the time of death based on the medical evidence, but it’s clear the victim has been deceased for more than twelve hours. Can you recall when was the last time you saw the murder weapon?” “Around ten o’clock yesterday morning,” I replied. “In that case, the crime likely occurred shortly after that.” “But there were witnesses passing by this shed all day,” I pointed out. Giraud chuckled sarcastically. “You are quite the detective! Who said the murder took place in this shed?” I hesitated, feeling flustered. “I just assumed.” “Oh, what a brilliant deduction! Tell me, do you believe a man stabbed in the heart would fall so neatly with his feet together and arms at his side? No.”",1
"""Indeed, quite intriguing,"" I remarked. Without delay, we embarked on our journey. Mr. Ingles and the Inspector took the lead. I discreetly pulled Poirot aside to converse away from the Inspector's ears. ""Poirot, what are your true thoughts on this matter? Is there more to it than meets the eye?"" ""Ah, that is the question, my friend. Whalley clearly states in his letter that the Big Four are hot on his trail, and we are aware, you and I, that the Big Four is no mere tale for the faint-hearted. Nevertheless, all evidence points to this man Grant as the perpetrator.""",1
"""Yet, the entire scenario is clear-cut. No, my dear colleague, this evidence has been meticulously fabricated, so skillfully that it has backfired."" ""How do you figure?"" ""Because, when the evidence against him was ambiguous and elusive, it was nearly impossible to disprove. However, in his haste, the culprit has tightened the noose so much that one loophole will release Inglethorp."" I fell silent. Shortly after, Poirot added: ""Let's analyze it differently. Imagine a man, who decides to poison his spouse. He has survived by his cunning. Presumably, he possesses some intelligence. He is not entirely foolish.""",1
"""But Madame Daubreuil has vanished. The authorities are on the hunt for her."" ""Do you think she was involved with her daughter?"" ""We may never find out. Madame is skilled at keeping her secrets. I highly doubt the police will locate her."" ""Has Jack Renauld been informed?"" ""Not yet."" ""This news will hit him hard."" ""Indeed. However, I suspect his feelings were never deeply invested. While we viewed Bella Duveen as a temptress and Marthe Daubreuil as his true love, I believe the opposite may be closer to reality.""",1
"“She disappeared that night, where she went is a mystery.” “She was on the island the whole time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man?” “Yes.” “Quite scandalous,” I remarked. “Pagett will be scandalized. He always disapproved of Anne Beddingfeld. Was that the young man she was meant to meet in Durban?” “I doubt it.” “Only share what you wish,” I encouraged. “I suspect this is a young man we should all be eager to find.” “Really?” I exclaimed, feeling anticipation rise. He confirmed. “Harry Rayburn, also known as Harry Lucas, that’s his true identity. He has slipped through our fingers again, but we will catch him soon enough.”",1
"It truly seemed as if Jack was careening towards his inevitable fate, with no regard for the consequences. I understood the urgent need he felt to hide the existence of a second dagger in the case, all for the sake of protecting Bella. As long as it was believed that there was only one weapon involved, suspicion would not fall upon the girl who had possessed the second paper-knife. Jack was bravely shielding his former lover, but it was becoming increasingly clear to me the great sacrifice he was making. The enormity of the challenge I had assigned to Poirot was beginning to dawn on me. It would be no simple feat to prove Jack Renauld's innocence without revealing the whole truth.",1
"""Oh, those English! Our ways are quite different. Let me tell you about a woman I knew who, at the start of the war, sought refuge in Ostend. There, she was gripped by a severe bout of nerves. Trapped with the enemy closing in, her only escape route was across the sea. But she had an absolute horror, mais une horreur! of the sea. Can you picture the dire circumstances she found herself in?"" ""And what did she do?"" I asked, my curiosity piqued. ""Luckily, her husband was a practical man. He remained remarkably composed, unaffected by her nerve-wracking crises.""",1
"Just as she nodded from time to time, occasionally shaking her head in response. He appeared quite forceful, pounding his fist on the table a couple of times. The rain had ceased, and the sky was brightening in its typical abrupt manner. ""At that moment, it seemed like he had finished speaking. He stood up, and she followed suit. He glanced at the window and inquired, perhaps about the rain. Regardless, she approached and peered outside. Suddenly, the moon emerged from the shadows of the clouds.""",1
"“His partners may have silenced and drugged him,” she pondered, “but I struggle to discern their motive. His value to them is minimal now, as he will undoubtedly be under intense surveillance until the enigma surrounding the Prime Minister is resolved.” “Could it be an attempt to mislead the authorities?” “If so, why the lack of effort? His account only mentions a cloth over his face, followed by darkness. There is no diversion in that. It appears quite close to reality.” “Very well,” she remarked, checking the time, “I believe it is time to head towards the station.”",1
"Tuppence glanced at the words on the page. Mr. Carter would have surely identified the case. It detailed the enigmatic death of a man in New York. ""As I mentioned to Miss Tuppence,"" the attorney continued, ""I embarked on a mission to turn the impossible into reality. The main obstacle was the fact that Julius Hersheimmer was indeed his real name. However, when I stumbled upon this specific passage, everything fell into place. Julius Hersheimmer had set off to uncover the fate of his relative. He traveled out West, where he received information and a photograph to assist in his quest. Tragically, just before leaving New York, he was ambushed and killed.""",1
"""We rushed up the driveway in pursuit of the fleeing silhouette. Catching sight of a dark figure in robes on the side terrace of the mansion, our target changed course and we followed suit, leading us to witness the encounter. Mrs. Maltravers appeared to almost lose her balance, her face visibly paling. “You,” she stammered. “I thought you were sailing to East Africa?” “I received urgent news from my solicitors that held me back,” the young man clarified. “My late uncle in Scotland passed away suddenly and bequeathed me an inheritance.""",1
"“Interesting,” he whispered. “We all possess the little grey cells. Yet, so few of us know how to utilize them. Good day, Signor Ascanio. Your account aligns closely with my assumptions. However, verification was necessary.” After showing his visitor to the door, Poirot settled back into his armchair and grinned in my direction. “Shall we listen to M. le Capitaine Hastings's take on the matter?” “I suppose Ascanio is correct, someone did impersonate him.” “You persist in neglecting to use the intelligence bestowed upon you. Reflect on certain remarks I made upon exiting the apartment that evening. I made note of the undrawn window curtains.”",1
"Presently I heard whispers approaching me, indicating that the other individuals had reached the meeting point before me. Carefully, I emerged from the cover of the bushes and slowly made my way down the steep trail, taking great care to avoid making any noise. A large rock was all that stood between me and the conversation taking place. Hidden in the darkness, I peeked around the corner only to find a menacing black gun pointed directly at me. ""Hands up!"" Mr. Ryland commanded. ""I've been expecting you.""",1
"""He sat in the darkness, hiding his face from view, but the threat in his words sent shivers down my spine. Suddenly, a sharp, icy metal pressed against my neck, as Ryland aimed his gun my way. ""Move over here, George,"" he sneered. Fuming with anger, I was forced into the shadows by the mysterious George (whom I suspected to be the notorious Deaves), who gagged and tied me up tightly. Ryland's voice, now cold and sinister, echoed around me. ""This is the end for both of you. You've crossed paths with the Big Four one too many times.""",1
"""It was frustrating missing out on Cabin 17, and it concerned me not being able to figure you out. Were you truly the innocent young girl you portrayed, or were you something else entirely? When Rayburn headed to the appointment that evening, Minks was tasked with stopping him. Minks, however, failed in his mission."" ""But why was the radio message referring to 'seventeen' instead of 'seventy-one'?"" ""I have a theory. Carton likely provided the wireless operator with his notes to transcribe onto a form, but he never double-checked the copy. The operator, just like the rest of us, misinterpreted it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.""",1
"""She hails from the heart of France, with a relentless dedication to the pursuit of knowledge."" Poirot simply raised an eyebrow, offering no response. After a brief silence, my diminutive companion gracefully stood up, a hint of solemnity in his peculiar demeanor. ""I've said my piece, gentlemen, to forewarn you. I anticipated skepticism, yet it is vital that you remain vigilant. My cautionary words will resonate, as each unfolding development validates your uncertain trust. Speaking now was imperative, for the opportunity may not have arisen later on.""",1
"Tommy's remark did not sit well with Tuppence. ""You're so cruel, Tommy. Acting as if we're invisible."" ""Apologies, Tuppence. What I meant was that we operate in secrecy, hidden from his awareness of our devious plans. Ha ha!"" ""Ha ha!"" Tuppence chuckled, getting up from her seat. South Audley Mansions, a grand block of flats near Park Lane, housed their target on the second floor. Tommy's smooth talking was now second nature to him.",1
"""The best spot to store brown paper and cardboard boxes is the top of a wardrobe. I've personally utilized this space for storage. When neatly arranged, it is quite pleasing to the eye."" ""Poirot,"" I inquired anxiously, ""have you reached a conclusion regarding this crime?"" ""Yes, I believe I have discerned how it was carried out."" ""Ah!"" ""Regrettably, I lack concrete evidence to support my theory, unless..."" With a sudden burst of energy, he grabbed my arm and guided me swiftly down the hallway, shouting in French in his excitement: ""Mademoiselle Dorcas, Mademoiselle Dorcas, un moment, s’il vous plaît!"" Dorcas, startled by the commotion, rushed out of the pantry.",1
"I wished Poirot had been there to use his brilliant mind to solve the problem. I unlocked the door with my key and made my way up to my room. There was a letter on the table, and I opened it absentmindedly. As I read its contents, I was frozen in place. It was a message from a law firm. The letter stated, ""DEAR SIR (it read), On behalf of our deceased client, M. Hercule Poirot, we are forwarding you the enclosed message. This letter was given to us a week prior to his passing, with instructions that it be delivered to you at a specified time after his death.",1
"Poirot's brow furrowed as he mulled over the letter from Bella found in the dead man's pocket. The magistrate suggested reaching out to the police in Santiago for more information about the victim's past. Noticing the legacy left in the will to the secretary, Poirot speculated on the implications. The mention of the date on the will hinted at a possible premonition of danger, revealing a complex web of relationships that could shed light on the mysterious murder case.",1
"”Tuppence tried once more. “I have a fondness for Julius,” she stated. Tommy’s reaction was immediate. “You will not marry him, do you understand?” he commanded. “I will not allow it.” Tuppence responded quietly, “Oh.” “Absolutely not,” Tommy reiterated. “He has no desire to marry me, he simply asked out of courtesy.” “Unlikely,” Tommy scoffed. “True. He is madly in love with Jane. I imagine he is proposing to her as we speak.” “They will make a good match,” Tommy remarked condescendingly.”",1
"In the hallway, Giraud faced Poirot, announcing the arrest of Jack Renauld for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld. Poirot, stunned by Jack's lack of defense, followed Giraud into the salon for an explanation. Giraud outlined his case, pointing to Jack's motive and means, confident in his detective work. However, Poirot cleverly pointed out a flaw in Giraud's reasoning, leaving him speechless. As Poirot left, he mentioned the overlooked lead piping, adding another layer to the mystery. Mrs. Renauld's entrance only deepened the intrigue, as Jack stood in silence, his fate hanging in the balance.",1
"Poirot was visibly frustrated, his card house crumbling before my eyes. ""I can build card houses seven stories high, but I cannot find that last link,"" he exclaimed. As he started to rebuild, placing each card with precision, I couldn't help but wonder what this missing link could be. Story by story, the card house rose under his hands, a delicate and intricate structure.",1
"""Pugnacious Mac,"" the moniker his colleagues bestowed upon him, vigorously and categorically opposed the rising Pacifist movement. He personified not just the Prime Minister of England, but the essence of England itself; his removal from power would have dealt a devastating and crippling blow to the nation. Poirot, meanwhile, meticulously dabbed at a gray suit with a tiny sponge. Hercule Poirot was the epitome of a fashion-conscious gentleman, with a fervent dedication to tidiness and organization. The scent of benzine permeated the room, making it impossible for him to focus entirely on our conversation.",1
"I was filled with resentment at his failure to confide in me, especially since I couldn't figure out what he was up to. It crossed my mind that he could have been questioning the folks over at Raikes’s farm; therefore, when I didn't find him at Leastways Cottage that Wednesday evening, I set off through the fields in the direction of the farm, hoping to run into him. Yet, he was nowhere to be found, leaving me hesitant to approach the farm directly. While walking back, I encountered an elderly countryman who eyed me slyly. ""You're from the Hall, aren't you?"" he inquired. ""Yes. I'm searching for a companion of mine who I believed might have passed through here.""",1
"I observed the paleness of her face beneath the makeup, and detected the fear in her trembling voice. It was then that the pieces fell into place, revealing why Poirot was on her trail and the depths of her apprehension. Moreover, it was in that instant that the truth about my own feelings became clear. ""Yes,"" I responded softly. ""Is he after me?"" she questioned in a hushed tone. After a brief pause from me, she sank to the floor beside the large armchair, overcome with intense, sorrowful sobs. I lowered myself beside her, enfolding her in my embrace and tenderly brushing the hair away from her tear-streaked face. ""Please don't weep, my dear, don't weep. You're safe here. I'll protect you. Please don't cry, my love. Everything is known.""",1
"""I gathered that you were indicating the presence of a highly significant message to convey to us."" ""Indeed, sir. Presently, there exists a vast network, an underworld organization. This organization, known as the Big Four, is overseen by four distinct individuals. Number One is Li Chang Yen, a Chinaman; Number Two is the wealthy American, Abe Ryland; Number Three is a French woman; and Number Four, as I suspect, is a relatively unknown English actor by the name of Claud Darrell. These four have united with the purpose of dismantling the current societal structure, and establishing in its place a state of chaos where they would hold absolute power.",1
"""No?” whispered Whittington. “Let me explain. I could easily find someone else for a lower fee. What I seek is a young woman with the wit and composure to play her role convincingly, and one who knows not to pry too much.” Tuppence smirked, feeling Whittington's point hit home. “There's one more thing. Why hasn't Mr. Beresford been mentioned yet?” “Mr. Beresford?” “My associate,” Tuppence stated proudly. “You saw us together yesterday.” “Ah, yes. But I'm afraid we won't be needing his assistance.",1
"She was a stranger to the London crowd. The images of the Marlow victim in the newspapers were so distorted that it's no surprise no one could recognize them. On the flip side, Nadina had concealed her plans to visit England from everyone. The day following the homicide, her manager received a letter supposedly from the dancer, stating she was rushing back to Russia due to urgent personal matters and he should handle her terminated contract as he saw fit. I only found out about all of this later. With Suzanne's complete agreement, I dispatched a lengthy telegram from De Aar. It arrived at a crucial moment (this, too, I discovered afterward).",1
"An incident quickly unfolded that deeply impacted the public consciousness. Suddenly, Sir John Willard passed away from a heart attack. Sensational tabloids wasted no time in resurrecting eerie tales linked to the cursed Egyptian artifacts. Despite the British Museum's dismissal, the infamous Mummy was once again thrust into the spotlight. Just two weeks later, Mr. Bleibner succumbed to lethal blood poisoning, followed shortly by his nephew's tragic suicide in New York.",1
"""In the event that you are stopped during your journey, I will furnish you with two distinct permits. One will be authorized by the Union Government, while the other will identify you as a British tourist uninvolved with the Union in any capacity."" ""A permit for each side, is that the idea?"" ""Precisely."" The task did not interest me as I am familiar with the potential consequences in such scenarios. Confusion inevitably arises, leading to errors. Handing the incorrect permit to the wrong individual could result in my prompt execution by an insurrectionist or a law enforcement officer. I observed the latter patrolling the streets, donning bowler hats, smoking pipes, and casually carrying rifles under their arms.",1
"Diamonds had been discovered in the vicinity of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers in the past, but John Eardsley and Lucas made a groundbreaking find of extensive carbon deposits at the confluence of two rivers. The diamonds they unearthed displayed a wide array of colors - pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and pristine white. Eardsley and Lucas traveled to Kimberley to have their precious gems evaluated, coinciding with a shocking heist at the De Beers establishment. Whenever diamonds are shipped to England, they are carefully packaged into a secure parcel.",1
"A short distance down the corridor, there was a second door to the left. Quietly, he made his way towards it. After pausing to listen, he turned the handle. It opened easily, allowing him to enter. The room, devoid of occupants, was set up like a bedroom. The furniture, much like the rest of the house, was in disrepair and covered in grime. However, what caught his attention was the object he had been searching for - a connecting door situated near the window on the left. Closing the door to the corridor, he walked over to the connecting door and inspected it carefully.",1
"He once again dodged as the lion leaped over him. This scenario repeated twice more before he reached the tent's entrance, where he grabbed his rifle. Upon reemerging with rifle in hand, the lion was nowhere to be seen, leaving him perplexed. Moving cautiously to the rear of the tent, he discovered the lion in a small clearing, practicing low jumps. The audience erupted in cheers as I sipped my champagne. ""On a different note,"" I interjected, ""my acquaintance encountered another peculiar situation.""",1
"""The only thing she could remember about him was that he had a clean-shaven face, was of average height, and bore a striking resemblance to a butcher. Poirot, unfazed by this description, remarked to me after the trial, ""He is quite the artist, Hastings. His disguise does not rely on fake beards or colored glasses. He changes his very essence; assuming a new identity entirely. He fully embodies the role."" I had to concede that the man who came from Hanwell had seamlessly blended into my preconceived notion of an asylum caretaker.""",1
"He made a stop at a small cottage hospital to get his wound treated before continuing on to Charing Cross, where a special train was ready to take him to Dover. Captain Daniels provided a brief account of the incident to the police before the man departed for France. Upon arrival in Dover, he boarded a waiting destroyer, and in Boulogne, a counterfeit car with the Union Jack awaited him. ""Is that all?"" inquired the listener. ""Yes,"" replied the man. ""Although, there is one rather odd detail that I must mention.""",1
"He casually signed the receipt, mentioning offhandedly: ""This pen feels different, but I injured my hand in a rush."" The employee just grinned and noted little change. Rolf chuckled and added: ""Just don't mistake me for a criminal this time. Been receiving ominous notes from a Chinese man, and the problem is, I bear a resemblance to one myself, especially in the eyes."" ""I observed him,"" the clerk recounted, ""and immediately understood his point. The eyes angled upwards like those of an Asian. It had never caught my attention previously.""",1
"Approaching closer, Madame Daubreuil's complexion regained a hint of color as she gazed down at the victim with a hint of intrigue. ""I have never seen him before,"" she stated, her words sounding genuine. Giraud nodded, indicating she could leave, prompting me to question the decision quietly. ""Are you sure it's wise to let her go? That black hair likely belongs to her."" With a dry tone, Giraud responded, ""I know how to handle my business. She is being watched. No need to arrest her just yet.""",1
"""I understand,"" I whispered softly. ""No words from you could be too harsh, Your Honor."" ""You didn't plan for this woman to be here?"" ""Absolutely not. I bumped into her unexpectedly. She's an English visitor in Merlinville, though I didn't know that until we crossed paths."" ""Hmm,"" the judge responded, his tone mellowing. ""It was against the rules, but I assume the lady is youthful and attractive, isn't she? Ah, to be young! O youth, youth!"" he sighed wistfully. The inspector, less sentimental and more pragmatic, asked, ""But didn't you shut and lock the door when you left?""",1
"Amidst the tired demeanor of one and the professional stoicism of the other, resided the same sharp intellect, cutting through the air like a dagger. As Sir James scrutinized him closely, the young man sensed a penetrating gaze that seemed to unravel his every secret. Wondering about the final verdict, he knew it was unlikely to be revealed. Sir James absorbed all, revealing only what he deemed fit. This was evident almost immediately after the initial pleasantries, when Julius unleashed a torrent of inquiries.",1
"” Tuppence crouched down, straining to hear. A faint whisper escaped her lips. “Mr. Brown?” The words hung in the air, sending a chill down her spine. Suddenly, she made a decision. “I won’t abandon this place. I'll stay up all night.” Relief flickered briefly in Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes before she drifted back to sleep. Yet, Tuppence couldn't shake off the unease that had settled in. Why did those words, “Mr. Brown,” sound so ominous? She couldn't help but glance nervously behind her, the looming wardrobe casting a foreboding shadow in the dimly lit room.",1
"‘It will require a significant investment.” “Thank you,” Tommy responded with a smile. “I suspect it may not turn out as expected, but good properties are hard to come by these days.” “Indeed,” the woman agreed enthusiastically. “My daughter and her husband have been on the hunt for a suitable cottage for quite some time now. The war has caused quite a disruption. But forgive me, sir, it will be too dark for you to properly see the house. Wouldn’t it be better to wait until tomorrow?” “Not to worry. We will still take a look around this evening. We would have arrived earlier if we hadn’t gotten lost.”",1
"“Detecting two gunshots fired,” he remarked, returning the weapon. “Now, madam, if I could inspect,” he delicately paused. “The maid will guide you,” she whispered, turning away. The parlourmaid led Poirot upstairs. I stayed behind with the elegant yet unfortunate woman. Unsure whether to speak, I attempted a few casual remarks to which she responded absentmindedly. After a brief moment, Poirot rejoined us. “Thank you for your cooperation, madam. I believe you need not worry further about this incident. By the way, are you familiar with your husband’s financial situation?” She shook her head.",1
"He quickly disposes of her and then proceeds to his task. Leaving the front door open slightly to create a misleading trail for the assassins, he secures Madame Renauld, ensuring she is unable to raise suspicion. The night air is cold as he covers his underclothes with an overcoat, planning to dispose of it along with the deceased. Carefully smoothing over the flower bed, he exits through the window, leaving incriminating evidence behind. As he ventures out onto the desolate golf course, he digs a grave and then...",1
"""I'll be there right away,"" I said, hanging up the phone. Turning to Poirot, I could barely contain my excitement. ""Poirot, we've been summoned by McNeil to see Flossie Monro, a friend of Claud Darrell's."" Poirot wasted no time, disappearing into his bedroom and returning with his hat. A taxi swiftly delivered us to Mr. McNeil's office, where we found a flamboyant woman seated across from the solicitor. Her yellow hair, adorned with curls, framed a face heavy with makeup, a stark reminder of her age.",1
"The footsteps were muffled by the dead leaves, as daylight faded away. It felt as though they were walking among phantoms. Above them, branches swayed and groaned with a sorrowful sound. Every now and then, a damp leaf drifted down soundlessly, sending a shiver down their spines. As they turned the corner, the house came into view. It appeared just as abandoned and desolate. The shutters were tightly shut, and the moss-covered steps leading to the door hinted at neglect. Could it be possible that Tuppence was lured to this lonely place? It seemed unlikely that anyone had set foot here in ages. Julius pulled on the rusty bell handle, producing a jarring clang that reverberated through the hollow interior.",1
"""Clearly, Giraud has missed the mark entirely. If Jack Renauld is truly guilty, it is despite Giraud's misguided arguments, not because of them. The most damning evidence against him is a secret that only I am aware of.""""What is it?"" I inquired, feeling intrigued.""If you were to engage your intellect, and analyze the case with the same clarity that I possess, you would also uncover it, my dear friend.""Poirot's response irritated me, as usual. Without pausing, he continued, ""Let us stroll towards the shoreline. We will perch on that small hill there, with a view of the beach, and reexamine the case. I will share all my insights with you, but I would rather you arrive at the truth independently, without my guidance.""",1
"""The check was made out to a certain Duveen,"" Poirot pointed out. ""I suspect it was the former,"" he continued, ""considering the resemblance to M. Renauld's handwriting."" The authenticity was quickly confirmed by cross-referencing it with a note found on the desk. The commissary, looking sheepish, muttered, ""I can't believe I missed this."" Poirot chuckled. ""Always check under the mats! My associate Hastings knows that any irregularity bothers me. When I noticed the rug askew, I immediately thought, 'Ah! The chair leg must have nudged it.'""",1
"""Who would want to work on a ship anyway? Sure, I promised my publishers my 'Reminiscences' by summer, but who really cares? Only old ladies in the suburbs read that stuff. My so-called famous encounters are nothing special. With Pagett's help, I fabricate dull stories about them. But Pagett is too ethical. He refuses to let me make up tales about people I never actually met. I tried being nice. 'You still look like a wreck, my friend,' I joked. 'You need some sun in a deck-chair. No need to say more.""",1
"There might be a hidden spy-hole in the walls. He realized he had likely been watched the whole time, given how cautious she had always been. Had he unknowingly revealed something incriminating? Unlikely. He had expressed a desire to flee and uncover Jane Finn's whereabouts, but nothing that could expose his true identity. Admittedly, his inquiry to Annette confirmed his lack of personal acquaintance with Jane Finn, but he had never claimed otherwise. The real question was, did Annette possess more information? Were her protests mainly for the benefit of others? He couldn't determine that.",1
"""But only when I learned that the order for Tommy's execution was issued immediately after our Sunday interview did I realize that he was the mastermind behind it all."" Tuppence, feeling outsmarted, admitted, ""I never saw it coming. I always thought I was the clever one, but Tommy has clearly outwitted me this time."" Julius chimed in, ""Tommy has truly outdone himself! So, instead of sitting there looking guilty, why don't you confess and tell us everything."" Tommy, feeling uneasy, replied, ""There's nothing to tell.""",1
"""The woman's early discovery of the theft disrupted her carefully laid plans. No doubt, the culprits are present. One of them must have concealed the stolen items, and it seems highly improbable that the chambermaid would be involved."" ""More than improbable, downright impossible!"" Poirot interjected calmly. The inspector looked puzzled. Poirot smiled modestly. ""Allow me to demonstrate. Hastings, my dear friend, please hold my watch carefully. It is a precious family heirloom! I meticulously timed Mademoiselle's movements - her first absence lasted twelve seconds, while her second lasted fifteen. Now, observe my movements. Madam, would you kindly provide me with the key to the jewel case.""",1
"A sharp pain hit me when it was slammed onto the surface. We were clearly overpowered and completely defeated. It signified the conclusion. ""Greetings in the lair of the Big Four, M. Hercule Poirot,"" Number Four remarked with a sneer. ""Encountering you once more is an unforeseen delight. Yet, was it truly necessary to come back from the dead just for this?"" Poirot remained silent. I couldn't bring myself to meet his gaze. ""Follow me,"" Number Four continued. ""Your appearance will surely catch my associates off guard."" He pointed towards a narrow entrance in the wall. We proceeded through it and entered a different room.",1
"""I whispered, 'No genuine without trademark.' Ned questioned, 'And the wires?' 'Any wires signed 'Andy' are from me,' I replied. Ned informed, 'Train arriving soon, Harry.' I rose from my seat. 'If I find a nice, steady man, should I marry him?' I inquired coyly. Harry approached me closely. 'Anne, if you marry anyone but me, I'll wring his neck. And as for you...' 'Yes,' I interrupted, feeling a pleasant thrill. 'I'll carry you off and give you a beating.' 'What a charming husband I've chosen,' I remarked sarcastically.""",1
"""It was their only hope, but hope quickly turned to despair. The Chinaman's demeanor was smooth and polite as he spoke, 'Allow me to guide you.' With a pause, he referenced some notes and began to speak, 'Dear Poirot, I believe I am closing in on Number Four. An individual of Chinese descent approached me earlier today, using a false pretext to lure me here. Fortunately, I was able to see through his deception and evade him. In turn, I managed to trail him discreetly, a task I executed with finesse. I have enlisted a sharp young man to deliver this message to you. Please compensate him with a half crown, as promised for the safe delivery.""",1
"Upon discovering that none of the station's staff had seen the arrival of a mysterious, black-bearded stranger on the night of the crime, it became evident that the murderer must have used a waiting car for a quick getaway. This very same vehicle was likely responsible for transporting the enigmatic housekeeper to her new place of employment. Subsequent investigations at the London Agency confirmed Poirot's suspicions, as no record of a ""Mrs. Middleton"" could be found in their archives. The involvement of this mysterious figure only added another layer of complexity to the case.",1
"“We won’t hesitate to put an end to you here, and attract unwanted attention from the authorities. We’ve arranged transportation for you tomorrow morning, but for now, we’re not leaving anything to chance,” Tommy retorted calmly, though his eyes betrayed his anxiety. “Your threats are as transparent as your intentions,” he added with a smirk. Number 14’s face flushed with anger. “Save your breath,” he snapped. Tommy remained silent, pondering how Mr. Brown had managed to uncover his true identity.",1
"""We'll start with the desk in the boudoir,"" John informed, ""then proceed to her bedroom. She stored her important documents in a purple case, we need to search it thoroughly."" ""There might be a newer will,"" the lawyer suggested. ""There is,"" Poirot interjected. John and the lawyer were surprised. ""Well, there was,"" Poirot continued calmly. ""What do you mean 'was'? Where is it now?"" ""Gone,"" Poirot stated. ""Gone?"" ""Yes, burnt. Look here.",1
"""I always knew this day would come,"" she said with a hint of sadness in her voice. ""Mother,"" pleaded the boy. ""Please, give her a chance. Marthe is not only beautiful, but kind-hearted as well. What more could you ask for?"" ""I have no personal vendetta against Miss Daubreuil,"" she replied coldly. ""But I would much rather see you with an English bride. Or, if she must be French, then not from a family with such questionable background."" The bitterness in her tone was unmistakable, revealing the deep animosity she held towards the woman who threatened to steal her son's heart. It was clear that the idea of her son falling for the daughter of her enemy was a hard pill to swallow.",1
"""The possibility of Ridgeway being the thief crossed my mind,"" Poirot mused aloud. ""It would have added a touch of elegance to the case, a display of meticulous planning. However, it may not have been as delightful for Miss Farquhar."" I interjected, unable to contain my curiosity any longer. Poirot, sensing my eagerness, proceeded to analyze the situation. The sealed package had mysteriously disappeared from the trunk, leaving no trace behind, much to Miss Farquhar's dismay.",1
"I caught her off guard with my announcement. ""South Africa? Oh Anne, we must tread carefully if we are to embark on such a journey."" I dreaded the thought of hesitation. I reassured her that my passage was already booked, and that upon arrival I intended to assume the role of a parlourmaid. It was a spontaneous decision, the only option that came to mind. I mentioned the high demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I convinced her that I was capable of looking after myself, and eventually, with a sense of relief in her voice, she agreed to the plan without further questioning.",1
"""But there's a good chance he'll have an extra one for himself."" ""But no one has brought that up,"" I countered. Poirot's voice took on a hint of authority. ""My dear friend, when solving a case, one mustn't rely solely on what is 'brought up.' Many crucial details may not be mentioned at all. And there are valid reasons for keeping them quiet. It's up to you to decide which is at play."" I fell silent, feeling a sense of awe creeping over me. In just a few moments, we arrived at the renowned shed.",1
"He observed me quietly for a moment before getting down to business. When I caught sight of myself in the mirror thirty minutes later, I was taken aback. The special footwear made me appear at least two inches taller, and the coat I had on was tailored to create a slender, awkward appearance. Subtle changes to my eyebrows gave my face an entirely different look, cheek pads altered my facial structure, and my once deep tan had vanished. My mustache was no more, and a noticeable gold tooth gleamed from one side of my mouth. ""From now on, you are Arthur Neville,"" Poirot declared.",1
"I looked at Race, a sudden urge to delve deeper into his story taking hold of me. ""Who would be considered Sir Laurence's closest relative, Race? Any idea?"" His smile was knowing. ""That would be me,"" he declared. (Anne's Story Continued) The evening of the masquerade ball marked a turning point for me. I realized it was time to share my burden with someone. Until then, I had relished working alone. But now, everything was different. Doubt clouded my mind, and a sense of isolation seeped into my soul for the first time.",1
"“No. 13 on Deck D?” I exclaimed in horror. “Absolutely not, I refuse to stay in that cabin.” Superstition had always been my weakness, and the thought of being in cabin 13 sent shivers down my spine. Reluctantly, I pleaded with the steward, “Please, tell me there is another available cabin.” After a moment of contemplation, the steward suggested, “What about cabin 17? It’s just down the starboard side. It was unoccupied this morning, but I suspect it may have been assigned by now. However, since the gentleman hasn’t moved in yet, he might not mind switching.” Eagerly, I accepted the offer and the steward went off to seek approval from the purser.",1
"""Come on, Poirot,"" I insisted, ""let's get moving."" ""Excellent, my friend, excellent! Where to, and against whom? Give me specifics, if you please."" ""Against the Big Four, obviously."" ""That goes without saying. But how do you propose we do it?"" ""The authorities,"" I suggested tentatively. Poirot chuckled. ""They would accuse us of daydreaming. We have no evidence to go on absolutely none. We must bide our time."" ""Wait for what?"" ""Wait for them to make a move. Consider this, in England you all understand and appreciate boxing. If one fighter doesn't act, the other will, and by allowing the opponent to initiate the attack, one gains insights about him.""",1
"We walked around the deck three times before settling into adjacent deck chairs. The night was silent, with no one else in sight. Colonel Race was a man of few words, a Rhodesian with a stern demeanor that intrigued me. As we sat there in silence, I couldn't help but wonder if he could be more than just a dance partner. I entertained the thought of marriage, even though he hadn't proposed. It was always best to be prepared, as the Boy Scouts say. In the dim light, I found myself considering the possibility of a future together, a future that seemed both thrilling and dangerous.",1
"""Can you believe it, Poirot? The chambermaid was the culprit all along,"" I exclaimed, shocked at the revelation. Poirot merely chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. ""Indeed, my friend, appearances can be deceiving,"" he replied cryptically. The mystery of the stolen necklace had finally been solved, thanks to Poirot's ingenious plan to uncover the truth. As we left the scene of the crime behind us, I couldn't help but marvel at the brilliance of my quirky little friend. Our next adventure awaited, and I knew that with Poirot by my side, there was no puzzle we couldn't solve.",1
"""Let them ascend,” declared Poirot, neatly tucking away his grey pants. Within moments, the two guests were shown in, and my pulse quickened as I realized that the first was none other than Lord Estair, Head of the House of Commons; his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I was aware, a trusted confidant of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” inquired Lord Estair. My companion nodded. The distinguished gentleman glanced at me and paused. “This is a matter of confidentiality.” “Feel free to speak in front of Captain Hastings,” my companion reassured, gesturing for me to stay.",1
"""There are certain situations where a man may choose to wear pajamas with an overcoat, while the other option remains highly unlikely,"" I replied. Poirot interjected, ""We must redirect our focus to unraveling the enigma of the unlocked door. I am quite certain that they did not exit through the door; the window was their means of escape."" Surprised, I questioned, ""The window?"" Poirot affirmed, ""Exactly."" I countered, ""But there were no footprints in the flower bed below."" Poirot nodded, ""Indeed, and there should have been. Consider this, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, mentioned that he had planted both flower beds the day before.""",1
"And then a sinister thought crossed my mind. Was I unknowingly stepping into a dangerous situation? What if this individual posing as Ingles's servant was actually working for the notorious organization known as the Big Four? I recalled hearing about Chinese priests who were skilled in feigning death. Perhaps Li Chang Yen had a group of devoted followers who were willing to sacrifice their lives at his bidding. I needed to stay vigilant. Just then, the figure lying in the bed moved. His eyes fluttered open and he muttered incomprehensibly.",1
"“Altitude seems to be doing wonders for me.”“Fresh air is truly invigorating,” remarked Colonel Race, with a smile.“Being cooped up in those cramped cabins would be the end of anyone,” Mrs. Blair stated, as she settled into a seat beside me and dismissed her companion with a slight nod.“Do you have an exterior cabin?” she inquired.I shook my head.“My dear, why not switch? There are plenty of vacancies. Many passengers disembarked at Madeira, and the ship is quite sparse. Have a word with the purser. He’s quite accommodating - he moved me to a lovely cabin because I wasn’t satisfied with the one I had. Speak with him during lunch when you head downstairs.”I felt a chill run down my spine.",1
"""Indeed, she certainly has a past! Though not as young as before, I have observed men turning their heads as she passes by. Recently, she seems to have more money to spare, a fact well-known in town. The days of penny-pinching are over."" With an air of absolute conviction, Françoise shook her head. M. Hautet pondered, stroking his beard. ""And what of Madame Renauld's reaction to this companionship?"" he inquired. Françoise simply shrugged. ""She has always been pleasant and polite. It's as if she is completely unaware.""",1
"I've encountered individuals who find pleasure in crossing the channel; individuals capable of remaining composed in their deck-chairs, leisurely awaiting the moment when the boat docks to collect their belongings and disembark. However, this is a skill I lack. As soon as I step foot on the vessel, I am overwhelmed by the sense that time is too limited to truly relax. I find myself constantly shifting my suit-cases around, unable to settle. Even when I venture to the saloon for a meal, I devour my food hastily, haunted by the fear of the boat reaching its destination before I resurface.",1
"""No sooner had the formalities concluded, Mrs. Pearson entered the room with wide eyes. ""There's a man here from 'Anwell from the 'Sylum. Can you believe it? Shall I bring him in?"" We nodded, and a large, stout man in uniform was escorted in. ""Good morning, gentlemen,"" he greeted with a smile. ""I suspect you have one of my patients here. He escaped last night."" ""He was here,"" Poirot stated calmly. ""Has he escaped again?"" inquired the keeper, looking worried. ""He is deceased,"" Poirot revealed. The man appeared more relieved than surprised. ""You don't say.""",1
"""Describe him to me,"" the detective inquired. ""Superficially, he appears to be an average, well-built, somewhat dull-witted British young man. His cognitive functions are sluggish. However, he possesses a complete absence of imagination, making it nearly impossible to manipulate him. He analyzes things methodically, tenaciously holding onto every detail. In contrast, the young woman operates on intuition rather than logic. Together, they form a dynamic duo. Speed and endurance."" ""He exudes self-assurance,"" reflected the Chief of Police. ""Indeed, and that is precisely why I am optimistic.""",1
"""It's a beautiful and consoling thought, isn't it? You can go now, but be cautious. Ah, he's left! My friend Hastings stares at me with reproachful eyes. It was all so simple! It was evident right from the start that out of the numerous applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions, only the Robinsons were deemed appropriate. Why? What was it that made them stand out from the others almost immediately? Their appearance? Maybe, but it wasn't that unique. Their name, then!"" ""But the name Robinson is quite common,"" I exclaimed.",1
"But she had firmly rejected any further involvement with her husband's killer, leading him to retaliate by sending a letter accusing her. She adamantly denied any part in plotting the crime, claiming she only discovered Georges Conneau with the bloody knife in hand that fateful night. Madame Beroldy's account was dubious at best, yet her talent for persuasion, honed through tales of royal scandals, made her narrative convincing. Her closing argument to the jury was nothing short of brilliant.",1
"""He hesitated for a moment, and Cynthia cut in: “But wouldn't I have noticed if someone had entered my room?” “Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.” “Drugged?” “Yes, indeed!” “You recall” he turned to all of us once more “that despite the commotion and noise in the adjacent room, Mademoiselle Cynthia remained asleep. This left two possibilities. Either her slumber was a ruse, which I highly doubted, or her state of unconsciousness was induced artificially. With this latter notion in mind, I meticulously examined all the coffee cups, keeping in mind that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had served Mademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the previous night.""",1
"""There was clearly going to be tension between the examining magistrate and the detective leading the case. They clashed from the beginning. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were incompetent, while M. Hautet, who was very serious, took offense at the laid-back attitude of the Paris detective. “Well, M. Giraud,” the magistrate said sharply. “I assume you have made great progress? You already know who the killers are, correct? And you also know exactly where they are hiding now?” Unfazed by the sarcasm, Giraud answered: “I at least know where they originated from.""",1
"Renauld’s plans to mislead the authorities were deceptively simple, a hallmark of a master criminal. Madame Renauld seemed a likely suspect, given her close relationship with the victim, but evidence pointed away from her guilt. The only other person known to be privy to Renauld’s intentions was Marthe Daubreuil, who confessed to overhearing his altercation with the vagrant. This revelation raised new questions and suspicions in the investigation.",1
"Poirot was about to call the police, but the man begged him not to. Poirot pushed the man down the steps and they hurried inside and locked the door. Poirot led them into a room, instructing the Italian to hide behind a curtain. Just in time, a woman burst into the room looking for her husband. Poirot reassured her and introduced himself. The Italian emerged brandishing a revolver, causing the woman to panic. Poirot calmed her down and she revealed the secret hiding place of incriminating evidence. Poirot let her go and assured her escape, before the Italian attempted to shoot her, only to find the gun unloaded. Poirot scolded him for carrying a loaded weapon and assured the safety of all involved.",1
"I presented myself as a potential renter. My target was the local real estate agents, who had a limited number of properties available. However, I underestimated my opponent. A friendly clerk provided details on several attractive properties. I had to use all my cunning to come up with flaws for each one. In the end, I was afraid I had hit a dead end. ""Do you have anything else?"" I inquired, feigning desperation. ""Perhaps something by the river, with a sizable garden and a small lodge,"" I mentioned, summarizing the key features of the Mill House, based on my research.",1
"""Welcome back from England, M. Poirot,"" he said casually. ""The case is nearing its end, isn't it?"" Poirot nodded, his demeanor subdued. ""I believe so,"" he replied. The other man, clearly pleased with Poirot's demeanor, commented on the lack of resistance from the suspect. ""It is quite remarkable,"" Poirot agreed, his tone mild. But his companion was already preoccupied with his cane, bidding Poirot farewell and expressing satisfaction with the resolution of the case.",1
"""We finished our meal and lingered by our coffee and cigarettes."" ""Had your husband departed for London by then?"" ""Indeed, he caught the 6.15 train."" ""Did he drive to the station or walk?"" ""We don't keep a car here. A vehicle from the Elmer's Dale garage picked him up."" ""Was Mr. Pace his usual self?"" ""Completely. Nothing seemed amiss."" ""Can you provide any details about the visitor?"" ""I'm sorry, I never laid eyes on him. Mrs. Middleton ushered him into the gun-room before informing my uncle.""",1
"Cynthia had just returned from the hospital, so I pulled up a chair next to her. I mentioned to her about Poirot's interest in seeing the dispensary. She responded eagerly, expressing her desire for him to come to tea there someday. I chuckled at the thought of Poirot's quirks, recalling how he had made her readjust her brooch in her tie. After a moment of silence, Cynthia leaned in and whispered, ""Mr. Hastings.""",1
"""The possession of Cabin 17 seems to be a matter of contention,"" I remarked casually. Pagett, with a look of concern, proceeded to reveal a mysterious encounter involving Mr. Chichester and Miss Beddingfeld. Despite my attempts to downplay the situation, Pagett persisted in his suspicions, insinuating foul play. His paranoia extended to the presence of Colonel Race, a Secret Service agent on board. As Pagett spun his tales of intrigue and danger, I couldn't help but find amusement in his dramatic nature. It was clear that the journey ahead was bound to be filled with unexpected twists and turns.",1
"""We caught up with Cinderella and headed swiftly towards Villa Geneviève. Poirot cast a glance back at the lighted window, observing Marthe's profile as she worked diligently. 'He's under watch, no doubt,' he whispered. Upon reaching Villa Geneviève, Poirot positioned himself discreetly behind some foliage to the left of the driveway, granting us a clear view while remaining unseen. The Villa was shrouded in darkness, its occupants likely asleep. We found ourselves right beneath Mrs. Renauld's open bedroom window in no time.""",1
"""After indulging in soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of beef, and a rice soufflé, the time was just around eight o’clock. Unfortunately, the plates and dishes had already been washed up. The question of finger-prints did not concern Poirot, rather, he was intrigued by Count Foscatini's appetite. Did the Count consume every dish? The answer was affirmative, although the quantity remained unknown. The plates were dirty and the dishes empty, except for the rice soufflé, of which a considerable portion remained.""",1
"""Are you certain about the date of the crime?"" questioned the magistrate. ""Yes, it was the morning of June 8th when we received the news,"" replied the railway official. A second official was summoned to corroborate the testimony. Jack Renauld was then pointed out by the officials. ""These men have positively identified you. What do you have to say for yourself?"" asked the magistrate. Jack simply shrugged in response. M. Hautet shared a knowing look with the greffier before noting down the answer. ""Renauld, does this item look familiar to you?"" The magistrate picked up an object from the table and presented it to the prisoner.",1
"""I knew Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent. I helped him with a Japanese wrestler once. He might be able to help us find what we're looking for. It took a while to find Mr. Aarons, but he was willing to assist us. We asked for a young girl named Bella Duveen. Mr. Aarons recognized her as part of the Dulcibella Kids. He informed us that they were performing in Coventry. We headed there and watched their act, which received applause. After the show, Cinderella approached me, scared and in tears. She confessed to taking the dagger because she was afraid of fingerprints on it. I reassured her and confessed my love for her, promising not to turn her in to the police.""",1
"""Ah, I see you're enjoying the taste on your lips,"" she remarked. The suspicions surrounding Dr. Quentin were fueled by the fact that he was merely a temporary replacement for the regular doctor, Dr. Bolitho. Many believed that Dr. Quentin's negligence led to the unfortunate incident. However, his testimony was nothing short of astonishing. It was revealed that Mr. Paynter had been unwell since his arrival at Croftlands, and Dr. Bolitho had been treating him before his absence.",1
"Jack Renauld adamantly denied any knowledge of his father's potential enemies in Santiago or elsewhere in South America. He claimed to have seen no change in his father's behavior recently and insisted that his father had never mentioned anything about a secret. Renauld believed his father's trip to South America was purely related to business. When M. Hautet paused, Giraud interjected, expressing his desire to ask his own questions. The magistrate, with a hint of coldness, granted Giraud permission. Moving his chair closer to the table, Giraud inquired about Jack Renauld's relationship with his father, to which the young man arrogantly affirmed a positive connection.",1
"""He recounts the conversation he had with the elderly man, mentioning the injection of strychnine almost nonchalantly, just in case anyone notices the faint mark left by the hypodermic needle. Suspicion immediately arises, wavering between an accidental occurrence and the possible guilt of Ah Ling due to the presence of poison in the curry."" ""But could Dr. Quentin actually be Number Four?"" ""I believe it's entirely possible. There does exist a genuine Dr. Quentin who is likely residing abroad. Number Four has merely assumed his identity temporarily. The arrangements made with Dr. Bolitho were all conducted through written correspondence, as the original locum doctor fell ill unexpectedly.""",1
"""Ever since M. Renauld arrived at Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has been depositing large amounts of money in notes at the bank. It adds up to a total of four thousand pounds in English currency,"" Stonor explained calmly. ""I simply transferred the money to him as he requested. It was not some kind of scheme."" The magistrate was taken aback. ""Then what could it have been?"" Stonor's hand came down on the table with a resounding thud. ""Blackmail,"" he stated firmly. The magistrate was visibly startled. ""Blackmail,"" Stonor repeated.",1
"As we arrived at Boulogne Harbor, Poirot greeted me with a smile, whispering that Laverguier's plan had been a success. Japp continued to study his map, insisting that the criminals must have switched cars to evade detection. The tall detective suggested checking the seaports, suspecting the Prime Minister may have been smuggled onto a ship. However, Japp dismissed this idea, explaining that all ports had been closed off immediately. The sun began to rise as we disembarked from the boat.",1
"“There’s something off about this situation,” he muttered. “First off, where the hell is Rayburn?” It’s true that we haven’t laid eyes on him since we got ashore. He didn’t even bother coming up to the hotel with us. I highly doubt he’s scared of Pagett, though. The whole thing is just plain frustrating. One secretary has disappeared without a trace, and the other one looks like a washed-up boxer. I can’t have him by my side looking like that. I’ll become the town’s joke. I have a meeting later to hand over old Milray’s love letter, but I won’t be bringing Pagett along.",1

Why on earth were you in Marlow?"" ""I thought that was clear."" ""I am becoming more perplexed by the moment. Let's rewind. You traveled to Florence.""

"""It’s her name,” Tuppence whispered, her eyes widening. “Shucks!” Julius exclaimed. “Her memory’s gone, poor kid. But it’s the one real and original Jane Finn we’ve got here.” Tuppence gasped in disbelief as a bullet narrowly missed her head, embedding itself in the car upholstery. “Down!” Julius shouted, sensing an ambush. The car accelerated forward, dodging three more shots. Julius peered over the back of the car, “Nothing to shoot at,” he muttered gloomily.",1
"“Did you take the London and South Western road?” asked Tuppence. “Waterloo Station?” Tuppence raised an eyebrow. “Did Tommy mention anything to you about it?” “I actually haven’t seen him,” Tuppence replied, a hint of annoyance in her voice. “But tell me more about Waterloo. What happened there?” “Tommy called me. Gave me a heads up. He was hot on the trail of two criminals,” explained the informant. “Ah, I understand now,” Tuppence said, intrigued. “Please continue.” “I rushed over immediately. Beresford was already on the scene. He identified the criminals. The larger one was my target, the man you outsmarted. Tommy handed me a ticket and instructed me to board the train. He was going to track down the other criminal.”",1

""Hm,"" the attorney replied, giving Julius a sharp look. ""And why is that?"" ""I thought bothering you with a small matter like this would be pointless."" ""I understand."" He paused. ""This so-called small matter is connected to a much larger affair, possibly bigger than you or Miss Tuppence realize. If this young man is alive, he might have crucial information to share with us.""",1
"As we stepped into the foyer, a woman was just making her way up the staircase. She moved swiftly, leaving behind an air of deep sorrow that is characteristic of a French widow. ""What a peculiar woman,"" Poirot commented as we exited the building. ""Madame Olivier? No, not her,"" I replied. ""There are few geniuses like her in the world. I was referring to the other woman - the one on the stairs."" ""I didn't catch a glimpse of her face,"" I admitted. ""And I doubt you could have. She didn't even glance at us,"" Poirot explained calmly.",1
And then it clicked - the memory of our first tea conversation on the day I arrived. The way her eyes gleamed when she mentioned poison as a woman's weapon. Her agitation on that fateful Tuesday evening. Could Mrs. Inglethorp have found out about something between her and Bauerstein? Was the crime committed to prevent her from revealing the truth? And what about that mysterious talk between Poirot and Evelyn Howard?,1
"""It's hard for you to believe, my friend, that a man would orchestrate his own demise? Instead of accepting this truth, you choose to believe a story that is even more far-fetched. Yes, Mr. Renauld did plan his own death, but there's a crucial detail you may have overlooked - he didn't plan to actually die."" I shook my head, feeling confused. ""But no, it's quite simple really,"" Poirot explained kindly. ""For Mr. Renauld's plan, a murderer wasn't needed, as I mentioned before, but a body was. Let's reconsider, this time from a different perspective."" Georges Conneau flees to Canada to avoid capture.""",1
"At the sight of her son, caught between the two enforcers of the law, she froze in shock. ""Jack,"" she whispered. ""Jack, what's going on?"" He met her gaze, his expression impassive. ""I've been taken into custody, mother."" ""What?"" Her cry was sharp, piercing the air, before she collapsed to the ground. Hastening to her side, we quickly lifted her limp form. After a moment, Poirot rose to his feet. ""She's sustained a nasty gash on her head, most likely from the stairwell. There may be a mild concussion as well. If Giraud needs a statement from her, he'll have to wait.""",1
"I shadowed her, worried she might collapse. I discovered her propped against the railings, ashen. With a dismissive gesture, she urged me to go. ""No, no, go away. I need solitude. Let me gather my thoughts in peace. Join the others downstairs."" Reluctantly, I complied. John and Lawrence sat in the dining-room. I joined their silence, but eventually spoke up: ""Where's Mr. Inglethorp?"" John shook his head. ""He's gone."" Our gazes locked. Where had Alfred Inglethorp disappeared to? His vanishing act was odd and perplexing.",1
"As his anger subsided, he steeled himself to confront the situation. The first step was to return the handle to its original position without alerting those inside. With painstaking precision, he executed this task. Once done, he stood up with a sense of relief. Tommy was not one to easily give up. Despite the setback, he remained determined to uncover the secrets of the locked room. If one strategy had faltered, he would need to devise another. Glancing around, he began to formulate a new plan.",1
"Inglethorp, who had been in the boudoir with her mistress, cast a sorrowful glance towards the prisoner in the dock. He was acutely aware of the futility of her brave facade, as the defense had no intention of disputing this fact. Mrs. Cavendish, naturally, could not testify against her own husband. Following inquiries on unrelated topics, Mr. Philips inquired: ""Do you recall a package being delivered for Mr. Lawrence Cavendish from Parkson's last June?"" Dorcas shook her head. ""I cannot recall, sir. It is possible, but Mr.",1
"The solicitors will mobilize a large group, including high-profile doctors, to examine the situation. They will likely conclude that my mental state was unstable. Following a period of rehabilitation in a serene institution, my mental well-being will be restored, and the doctors will confirm my sanity. This will lead to a positive outcome for Julius. I am willing to endure a temporary retreat in order to eliminate you, but do not delude yourself into thinking I will face punishment for it!” The Russian placed his trust in the man, being corrupt himself and having unwavering faith in the influence of wealth.",1
"""The Inspector stood proudly. ""What do you make of this, gentlemen?"" ""I believe,"" Poirot remarked, ""that it is undeniably a case of remarkable clarity. This Biggs, or Grant, must be quite naive and ignorant, wouldn't you say?"" ""Indeed, he is a crude, unsophisticated man. Completely oblivious to the significance of a footprint."" ""It seems he does not indulge in detective fiction! Well done, Inspector. Shall we proceed to the crime scene. Shall we?"" ""I will personally escort you there. I want you to examine those footprints."" ""I am equally eager to inspect them.""",1
"""He meticulously adjusted his mustache, pondering each detail. 'Let's see! One clue connects to the next, guiding us forward. Does this piece align with the puzzle? Yes, perfect! Onward we go. But this other detail, no! Ah, how intriguing! A missing link in the chain. We analyze. We dig deeper. And that seemingly insignificant detail, that one small anomaly, we highlight it here!' With a dramatic sweep of his hand, he emphasized the importance of the discovery.""",1
"I was trapped by my captor, a man who clearly had been following my every move. Despite my attempts to reason with him, he seemed determined to keep me captive. I found myself bound and gagged in a dusty attic, completely at his mercy. As the night wore on, I struggled against my restraints, desperate for a way out. And then, in the dim moonlight, I spotted a glint of broken glass in the corner. An idea began to form in my mind. Despite the pain and stiffness, I knew I had to try. Slowly, I started to roll towards the glass, inching closer with every agonizing movement. It was a risky plan, but it was my only hope of escape.",1
"""It would greatly annoy me if anyone dared to make a fool of you."" ""Understood. But I feel obliged to inform you "" ""I am well aware of everything. You are my adversary! So be it. It doesn't bother me in the slightest."" ""As long as it's all fair and transparent, I have no objections."" ""You possess the quintessential English love for 'fair-play!' Now that your moral concerns have been met, let us leave without delay. Time is of the essence. Our time in England has been brief yet adequate. I have uncovered what I sought to discover."" The tone was nonchalant, yet I detected a hidden threat in the statement. ""However "" I started, then fell silent. ""Nevertheless, as you wish! Undoubtedly, you are content with the role you are performing.""",1
"Her chest rose and fell with each breath, her eyes widening in disbelief. ""You're involved in this?"" I simply nodded, knowing I had hit the mark. The intensity of her emotions was clear as day. A brief silence followed, her gaze fixed on me. Then, with a firm nod, she spoke. ""Well, paint me surprised! Show me everything. I want to witness the darkness."" ""What do you mean?"" I inquired. ""Exactly what I said. Believe me, I have a fascination for crimes. Why else would I risk my feet in these high heels, trudging through this mess?"" Hours had been spent scouring the area, searching for clues.",1
"As she ascended the stairs, Mrs. Inglethorp requested, ""Just bring my despatch-case up for me, dear. I'm heading to bed."" The wide door leading to the hall provided a clear view. Standing up alongside Cynthia, I noticed John nearby. Thus, three witnesses could confirm that Mrs. Inglethorp carried her untouched coffee. Dr. Bauerstein's presence throughout the evening dampened my mood. It felt as though he would never depart. Finally, he stood up, bringing me a sense of relief. ""I'll accompany you to the village,"" Mr. Inglethorp mentioned. ""I need to meet with our agent regarding the estate accounts."" Addressing John, he added, ""There's no need for anyone to stay up.""",1
"Upon unraveling the mystery, it became clear that de Castina, or whoever she truly was, had arranged to rendezvous at the Mill House. The pieces fell into place as I deduced their clever tactic of obtaining simultaneous house viewings to avoid suspicion. The sudden encounter between the ""doctor"" and the Moth Ball man indicated an unforeseen and unsettling turn of events. With the disguise discarded, the ""doctor"" discreetly trailed the woman to Marlow, leaving a trail of unanswered questions in their wake.",1
"Depression had settled heavily upon him, a burden impossible to shake. He was certain of the futility of their mission, the enemy far ahead by over three hours. Mr. Brown would not underestimate the chance of the telegram's discovery. The journey felt endless, especially when they veered off course, adding unnecessary distance. As the clock struck seven, a young boy pointed them towards ""t’ Moat House"" around the corner. A decrepit iron gate creaked open, leading down a path obscured by fallen leaves. An eerie sensation enveloped them as they proceeded up the deserted driveway.",1
"I believed I was being clever as I followed him through the swaying portières. Suzanne put up a fight, but eventually agreed to carry out my plan. I arrived at my destination early the next morning and was met by a Dutchman with a car. As we drove, the sound of guns grew closer. Eventually, we arrived at a rundown building and I was ushered in to see Mr. Harry Rayburn, who seemed to recognize me. He questioned why I had fallen into the trap again, but I remained composed. Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew tried to get down to business, but I insisted on speaking with Sir Eustace Pedler. After a brief exchange, I was led to Sir Eustace, who greeted me warmly and admitted to being the 'Colonel'.",1
"In some mysterious manner, I found myself in a perilous situation. There was a piece of information, real or perceived, that made others desperate to eliminate me, and it was somehow connected to the valuable diamonds. I was convinced that one individual, The Man in the Brown Suit named Harry Rayburn, held the missing puzzle piece. However, he had disappeared into the shadows, evading capture. It was unlikely that our paths would cross again. Shaking off sentimental thoughts of Harry Rayburn, I refocused on the present circumstances.",1
"A large settee covered in chintz sat against the wall, the window seats also upholstered in the same faded fabric. Poirot, with his small cigarette in hand, discussed their plan of action. The key to their investigation, he believed, lay within this room. They would carefully examine the desk's documents for any hidden clues. After some questioning, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen from Plymouth to create a secret compartment in the fireplace. With this new lead, they set off to Plymouth to uncover the truth.",1
"""And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.",1
"Marthe Daubreuil had a plan, but it was thwarted by a struggle with Madame Renauld. Although Marthe tried to make it look like suicide, she was checkmated by another woman with strong hands. Poirot suspected Marthe from the start, based on her anxious eyes. Madame Renauld's son, Jack, was kept in the dark about his father's past until Poirot revealed the truth. Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother. Poirot advised him to be honest with his love interest, Bella, and to ask for her forgiveness. In the end, Poirot received a visit from a film star, Mary Marvell, who was being threatened over a valuable diamond. Poirot advised her to keep the diamond safe until the threat had passed.",1
"‘Instruct them to arrange a taxi for me,’ she demanded, hastily adjusting her hat in front of the mirror. Within moments, she was gone, descending the steps and slipping into the waiting taxi. From inside the vehicle, her voice echoed the words I had shared with you."" The young boy paused to catch his breath, while Tommy's gaze remained fixed on him. Just then, Julius returned holding an unfolded letter. ""Hersheimmer,"" he addressed Tommy, ""Tuppence has embarked on a solo investigation."" ""Oh, bother!"" Tommy exclaimed. ""Indeed she has.""",1
"Flemming and her friends appeared to be incredibly mundane to me. Their conversations revolved around themselves, their children, and the struggles of procuring quality milk for their little ones. They would then transition to discussing the challenges of finding reliable servants, recounting their interactions with the staff at the Registry Office. It was rare to see them engage with current events or show any interest in the world beyond their comfort zone. They harbored a distaste for travel, finding everything abroad too unfamiliar compared to their beloved England.",1
"In the Sunday papers there was a brief notice regarding the unexpected passing of the renowned K.C., Sir James Peel Edgerton. The following day's paper provided a detailed account of the deceased man's successful career. The specific circumstances surrounding his sudden death remained undisclosed to the public. Tommy's earlier prediction of the events had proven to be accurate. The entire operation had been orchestrated by a single individual. With their leader gone, the group quickly disintegrated. Kramenin hastily returned to Russia, departing from England at dawn on Sunday. The criminal gang fled Astley Priors in a state of panic, leaving incriminating evidence behind in their rush, ultimately sealing their own fate.",1
"""It was a beautiful day!” I exclaimed. “Poirot, you must be joking!” “Not at all. The temperature was a balmy 80 degrees in the shade. Remember that, my friend. It holds the answer to the mystery!” “And what about the second clue?” I inquired. “The crucial detail that Monsieur Inglethorp dresses oddly, sports a black beard, and wears glasses.” “Poirot, you can't be serious.” “I assure you, I am deadly serious, my friend.” “This seems absurd!” “On the contrary, it is of utmost importance.” “But what if the Coroner’s jury accuses Alfred Inglethorp of Willful Murder.",1
"Her face was elongated and pallid, with captivating deep eyes that blazed with an almost zealous intensity. She resembled more a ancient priestess than a contemporary woman from France. A scar marred one side of her face, a reminder of the tragic accident that had taken her husband and colleague in a laboratory explosion three years prior, leaving her with severe burns. Since that fateful day, she had isolated herself from society, immersing herself with fervent determination in her scientific studies. Greeting us with a distant formality, she stated, ""I have been interrogated by the authorities numerous times, gentlemen.""",1
"""Mr. Cavendish, I must ask you about the incidents of yesterday afternoon. Was there a dispute with your mistress?"" Dorcas hesitated. Poirot fixed his gaze on her. ""It is crucial that I am informed of every aspect of that argument. Your mistress is deceased, and it is vital for us to uncover the truth in order to seek justice. While nothing can revive her, our goal is to apprehend the culprit."" ""I wholeheartedly agree,"" Dorcas declared firmly.",1
"""Julius P. Hersheimmer.” A faint flush flitted over the girl’s face, as Julius stepped forward and took her hand. “How do, Cousin Jane?” he said lightly. But Tommy caught the tremor in his voice. “Are you really Uncle Hiram’s son?” she asked wonderingly. Her voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an almost thrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy, but he thrust the impression aside as impossible. “Sure thing.” “We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,” continued the girl, in her low soft tones. “But I never thought I’d meet you one day.",1
"""The bearded man took him up sharply. “Yes a bargain. My life and liberty against ” He paused. “Against what?” The group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop. The effect of his words was electrical. Tommy spoke. “The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the Lusitania.”“No,” admitted Boris at last sullenly, “you do not.” “Thank God, he’s not a mind reader,” thought Tommy. Aloud he pursued his advantage: “And why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts me in a position to propose a bargain.”",1
"""Ah, Monsieur Poirot is here. He's assisting us, Evie,"" Miss Howard greeted Poirot, eyeing John warily. ""Assisting us with what?"" ""Assisting us in our investigation."" ""There's nothing to investigate. Has he been sent to prison yet?"" ""Who has been sent to prison?"" ""Alfred Inglethorp, obviously!"" ""Evie, please be cautious. Lawrence believes my mother died of a heart attack."" ""Lawrence is a fool!"" Miss Howard snapped. ""Alfred Inglethorp definitely killed poor Emily, just as I always suspected he would."" ""Evie, lower your voice. Regardless of our thoughts, it's best to remain discreet for now.""",1
"A large chintz-covered sofa was placed against the wall, while the window seats were adorned with the same faded chintz fabric. Poirot, with his customary cigarette in hand, proposed a plan to search for a clue in the room. The key to the desk had an unfamiliar note attached to it, indicating a different presence in the house. After questioning the Bakers, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen to create a hidden compartment in the fireplace. With this new information, we set off to Plymouth to uncover the truth.",1
"Rushing into the bedroom at the sound of faint moans, she was met with a horrifying scene. Madame Beroldy was on the floor, her hands and feet tied, emitting weak cries after managing to remove the gag from her mouth. Meanwhile, Monsieur Beroldy lay on the bed, surrounded by a pool of blood, a knife plunged into his heart. Madame Beroldy recounted the harrowing events that had unfolded - two masked figures had startled her awake, restraining and silencing her before turning their attention to Monsieur Beroldy in search of a mysterious ""secret"".",1
"“She might have been.” “She was,” John declared. “We were just talking about wills being annulled by marriage yesterday.” “Ah! Another thing, Mr. Wells. You mentioned ‘her final will.’ Did Mrs. Inglethorp have multiple previous wills?” “On average, she created a fresh will at least once annually,” Mr. Wells stated calmly. “She frequently changed her mind about who would inherit, sometimes favoring one family member, sometimes another.” “Imagine,” Poirot proposed, “if, unbeknownst to you, she had made a new will in favor of someone not related to the family at all, let's say Miss Howard, for example, would that surprise you?” “Not at all.",1
"He confidently approaches the village pharmacist, buying strychnine using his own name and a fake tale involving a dog. The poison is not used right away, instead he waits until a loud argument with her, drawing suspicion. He makes no effort to prove his innocence or provide an alibi, relying on the chemist's assistant to reveal the truth. It's hard to believe anyone would be so foolish, only a madman would act in such a way, risking being hanged. ""I don't understand,"" I started to say.",1
"""My desire for creative outlet grows stronger by the day. The only way my story will be revealed is through my demise. Since childhood, I've been aware of my extraordinary gifts. Underestimating oneself is a mistake. My intellect far surpasses that of the norm. Success is my destiny. The only hindrance is my outward image - unnoticeable and unremarkable. As a young boy, I observed a high-profile murder case unfold. The defense attorney's persuasive arguments left a lasting impact on me.""",1
"“Indeed,” replied the doctor calmly. “What alias did she use?” “Janet Vandemeyer. Supposedly a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s.” “When did she seek your assistance?” “In either June or July of 1915, if memory serves me correctly.” “Was she of sound mind?” “She appeared to be in full possession of her faculties. According to Mrs. Vandemeyer, the girl had endured a traumatic experience when the Lusitania sank.” “It seems we are making progress,” Sir James remarked.  “Just as I suspected, I am clueless!” Julius interjected.  The doctor observed them all with interest.  “You mentioned a desire for her testimony,” he noted.",1
"The Chinaman's eyes fluttered rapidly, seemingly agreeing, and he uttered another Italian term, ""carrozza."" A few more whispered Italian words reached my ears before he suddenly collapsed. The doctor motioned for me to step back. It was done. The man was gone. I exited, feeling utterly confused. ""Handel's Largo,"" and a ""carrozza."" If memory served, a carrozza was a carriage. What could possibly be the significance of those seemingly simple words? The man was Chinese, not Italian, so why speak in Italian? If he was truly Ingles's servant, wouldn't he know English? The whole situation was deeply perplexing. I pondered it on my journey home.",1
"""There,"" he said, ""although I can produce no proof that would count in a court of law, I speak from my own knowledge. I know personally every man who counts for anything in China today, and this I can tell you: the men who loom most largely in the public eye are men of little or no personality. They are marionettes who dance to the wires pulled by a master hand, and that hand is Li Chang Yen's. His is the controlling brain of the East today. We don't understand the East we never shall; but Li Chang Yen is its moving spirit. Not that he comes out into the limelight oh, not at all; he never moves from his palace in Pekin.",1
"""Poirot, I believe you were the last person to see the dagger. Is that correct?"" Inspector Giraud's piercing eyes bore into Poirot's. ""Oui, it is true,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""But I did not touch it, I did not take it."" ""Then who did?"" Giraud pressed, his tone accusatory. Poirot's gaze remained steady. ""That, my friend, is the question, is it not?"" The room fell into a tense silence as everyone pondered the implications of the missing dagger. It was a crucial piece of evidence, now vanished into thin air. The investigation had just taken a sharp turn, and the truth seemed more elusive than ever.",1
"""Pedler was deceived into thinking Rayburn was his new secretary, not Mr. Pagett,"" Suzanne whispered anxiously, her hand squeezing mine under the table. ""But where is Rayburn now?"" I held my breath, eager for an answer. ""He's vanished without a trace,"" came the reply. ""And Sir Eustace?"" Suzanne inquired. ""He sees it as a direct affront from Fate."" Later that day, we were interrupted from our nap by a note delivered by a page-boy, providing us with a chance to hear Sir Eustace's perspective on the situation.",1
"“Excuse me, Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Please, have a seat. You got my message. I am determined to solve this puzzle. You can help me in some way. Let's start. You and a companion went to see the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th.” The Italian reacted angrily. “That never happened. I testified in court” “Exactly, and I suspect that you lied under oath.” “Are you trying to intimidate me? Ha! I have nothing to hide. I have been cleared of all charges.” “Indeed; and since I am not foolish, I am not threatening you with punishment but with exposure.",1
"""Listen, he's an invalid,"" I said.   ""Was there a big crowd watching?""   ""Maybe twelve or more people,"" I replied.   Poirot shook his head. ""This won't be easy for you, my friend.""   ""Once I confirm that Wilson was poisoned, I can move forward.""   ""But what if the real target was Savaronoff, and the killer tries again while we wait?""   ""I have it covered. Two men are keeping an eye on Savaronoff's place.""   Poirot smirked. ""Very helpful in case someone shows up with a bomb,"" he remarked.   Japp chuckled. ""You're starting to get into it, Monsieur Poirot.""",1
"""But surely you must have heard something, a loud noise perhaps?"" ""No, I heard nothing at all."" ""Are you sure? It's quite unusual for me to be so clumsy. I merely made a small movement with my left hand, and the table by the bed toppled over!"" Poirot looked genuinely upset and embarrassed, so I quickly tried to reassure him. ""Don't worry, my friend. It's not a big deal. Your success downstairs must have gotten you all worked up. I have to say, it was quite a shock to everyone. There must be more to this situation between Inglethorp and Mrs. Raikes than we initially believed, for him to keep silent so stubbornly. What's your plan now? Have the Scotland Yard detectives left to question the staff?""",1
"""He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course.""",1
"""To see those two brought to justice, that is a different story. Japp will do his best, but I fear we may have to leave it to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer."" ""The wicked may prosper for a time,"" I replied. ""But there is always a cost, mon ami."" Poirot's fears were realized. Despite Japp's confidence in his theory, he couldn't gather enough evidence for a conviction. Mr. Pace's substantial fortune fell into the hands of his killers.""",1
"Poirot raised an eyebrow, ""M. Stonor, how long has the English chauffeur, Masters, been with M. Renauld?"" Stonor replied confidently, ""Over a year."" Poirot continued, ""And has he ever traveled to South America?"" Stonor shook his head, ""I'm quite sure he hasn't. Before working for Mr. Renauld, he was in Gloucestershire for many years with people I know."" Poirot pressed, ""So you can vouch for him as being beyond suspicion?"" Stonor nodded, ""Absolutely.""",1
"I never knew what bêche-de-mer was, and I probably never will. I've made guesses before and they've always been wrong. In South Africa, they talk about a stoep, which I now know is the same as a veranda or a piazza. Pawpaws were another mystery to me until I had one for breakfast. I mistook it for a bad melon at first, but a Dutch waitress set me straight. Lemon juice and sugar made it much more palatable. I was glad to finally meet a pawpaw.",1
"""Upon Poirot's crest-fallen expression, the magistrate called for Marchaud. 'Please convey my regards to Madame Renauld,' he said, 'and ask if she would spare a few moments to speak with me. Let her know not to trouble herself; I will come up to her.' Marchaud saluted and left. We lingered in anticipation until, unexpectedly, the door swung open and Mrs. Renauld, ashen in her mourning attire, appeared. M. Hautet hastily offered her a chair, expressing his concern, to which she responded with a grateful smile. Stonor, overcome with emotion, clasped one of her hands in his, unable to find the right words.""",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had captivated Paris, graciously acknowledged the applause, her black eyes gleaming and scarlet lips curling upwards. The Manager, a bearded gentleman, embraced her warmly, praising her exceptional performance. Bouquets and futuristic garments filled her dressing room, the air heavy with the scent of blossoms and perfumes. When Count Sergius Paulovitch arrived, Nadina's demeanor shifted subtly. They conversed in English, revealing a shared heritage. Despite her success, Nadina expressed unease about lingering suspicions from the War.",1
"""Remember, not a single word to anyone,"" Sir Eustace paused. ""I trust your creative flair to add the finishing touches,"" he added. ""Just ensure there are no errors."" ""Simply sign it 'With eternal love, Anne,'"" I suggested. As I penned the words, Sir Eustace reached for the letter and scanned it. ""Looks good. Now, the destination."" I disclosed the address of a discreet shop known for handling mail and messages. Sir Eustace rang the bell on the table. Chichester-Pettigrew, also known as Minks, appeared promptly. ""Send this letter through the usual channels without delay,"" Sir Eustace instructed.",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer, took her final bow on stage, accepting praise from the Manager. After the performance, she received a visit from Count Sergius Paulovitch, who congratulated her on her success. As they conversed in English, Nadina revealed a secret to the Count - she possessed diamonds that could be used to blackmail their chief, the 'Colonel.' The Count warned her of the dangers of blackmailing such a man, but Nadina remained confident in her plan. She disclosed that her husband, who was arriving from Africa, was also involved in their scheme to confront the 'Colonel.' Despite the Count's doubts, Nadina was resolute in her decision to take on their powerful adversary.",1
"With your approval, my friend, I shall step outside for a breath of fresh air. Please anticipate my prompt return. I do not intend to be away for long."" I was in a daze in my armchair when the innkeeper knocked on the door and peeked inside. ""There is another woman here to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I informed her that he was not in, but she insists on waiting, claiming she has journeyed from the countryside."" ""Very well, bring her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can be of assistance."" In a flash, the woman was escorted into the room. My pulse quickened as I realized who she was. Lady Yardly had been featured too many times in the Society pages to go unnoticed.",1
"‘Open to any reasonable proposal if compensation is satisfactory.’ How about that?” “I think we should avoid mentioning compensation multiple times. It may come off as overly eager.” “I can’t help but feel eager! But you may be right. Let me try again. ‘Seeking two bold individuals for hire. Willing to undertake any task, travel anywhere. Compensation must be generous. Will not entertain unreasonable offers.’ How does that sound to you?” “That would either seem like a scam, or the work of a madman.” “It’s not nearly as absurd as something I came across earlier that started with ‘Petunia’ and was signed ‘Best Boy.’”",1
"Tuppence couldn't bear to be seen in her fancy clothes. She decided to ask Felix for help with the menu, knowing he was a skilled head waiter. As she made her way towards the Serpentine, she checked her watch and realized it was almost six o’clock. Ignoring her hunger due to excitement, she strolled to Kensington Gardens and back, feeling refreshed. Despite trying to push thoughts of the evening out of her mind, the urge to go back to South Audley Mansions grew stronger as she approached Hyde Park corner.",1
"Poirot wasted no time and got straight to the point with a professional efficiency. ""Annie, I called you here because I believe you may have information about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp penned last evening. How many were there? And were you able to catch any of the names or addresses?"" Annie paused, pondering. ""There were four letters, sir. One was addressed to Miss Howard, another to Mr. Wells, the attorney, and the remaining two slip my mind, sir oh, yes, one was intended for Ross's, the caterers in Tadminster. The last one, I can't recall."" ""Try,"" Poirot insisted. Despite her efforts, Annie struggled to remember. ""I apologize, sir, but it's completely slipped my mind.""",1
"""He doesn't have much going against him, besides the mystery surrounding his background and his proficiency in numerous languages, which is unusual for an Englishman. (Excuse my bluntness, but your linguistic abilities are truly lacking!) As for the victim, he was discovered gagged, tied up, and under the influence of chloroform, indicating he may not have been involved in the crime."" Poirot dismissed the idea. ""The French authorities would not overlook such a detail. Additionally, once he achieved his goal of abducting the Prime Minister, there would be no reason for him to stick around.""",1
"""I appreciate your offer to locate my missing child, but I must inform you that your efforts would be in vain,"" she stated coolly. ""Nevertheless, I promise to reunite you with your child,"" he declared with conviction. ""Can you really bring back the dead?"" she questioned. ""Yes,"" he replied simply. Placing his hand on her wrist, he repeated, ""I will bring the dead back to life."" She gazed at him intently, disbelief written on her face. ""You doubt me. I will demonstrate my ability. Retrieve my stolen pocket-book,"" he instructed.",1
"""Excuse me,"" he said. ""May I have a word with you?"" Tuppence spun around, ready to unleash a torrent of words, but something in his demeanor stopped her. She paused, uncertain. Sensing her hesitation, he added, ""I assure you, I come in peace."" Despite her initial reservations, Tuppence found herself starting to believe him. While she couldn't shake off her unease around him, she began to question her initial assumptions about his intentions. Giving him a once-over, she tried to read him.",1

""Feel free, my friend. Goodbye."" I exited through the main entrance. The heat was quite intense. I headed down the same path we had traversed the previous day.""",1
"As soon as her eyes met mine, a rush of guilt consumed me. She had been the one to caution me so seriously, a warning I had foolishly disregarded. How quickly and dismissively I had pushed it aside. Now, faced with the tragic truth of her words, I was filled with shame. She had been intimately acquainted with Alfred Inglethorp. I pondered whether her presence at Styles could have averted the disaster, or if the man would have been deterred by her vigilant gaze. The pressure lifted as she clasped my hand, her familiar and painful grip a stark reminder of the past.",1

The footprints you're referring to were actually left by the workers who found the body.""The man grunted in frustration.

Is that accurate?"" ""Yes."" ""Are you absolutely certain that he truly forgot the latch-key and didn't take it with him after all?"" ""I honestly don't know. It never crossed my mind to check.

"I had never seen anything quite like Cinderella. Her obsession with morbid excitement was palpable, overshadowing her youthful appearance. Despite her beauty, there was a ghoulish aspect to her that gave me pause. As we explored the crime scene together, she displayed a brashness that both intrigued and unsettled me. The discovery of the victim's body seemed to have a profound effect on her, stripping away her carefree demeanor to reveal a raw vulnerability. It was a stark reminder of the darkness that lurks beneath the surface, waiting to be unearthed. In that moment, she was no longer the daring girl I had known, but a frightened soul seeking solace in a world haunted by shadows.",1
"As she watched him, a sense of intrigue washed over her. He kept to himself, shutting down any attempts at conversation. His constant glances over his shoulder revealed a deep-seated paranoia. The nervous beads of sweat on his forehead betrayed his inner turmoil. Despite his fear, he exuded an aura of defiance that intrigued her. When their eyes met, she could sense the weight of his inner conflict. His muttered words hinted at a decision made in desperation.",1
"I almost died at the sight of her wicked face, but I managed to muster a hesitant smile and asked in French about my whereabouts. She seemed confused and summoned the man she was conversing with. He lingered by the screen, his face obscured in shadow, and addressed me in French. Though his voice was unremarkable and hushed, for some reason, he instilled more fear in me than the woman did. It was as if he could see into my soul, yet I continued to act my role.",1
"""Where was it eventually located?” “Atop a wardrobe.” “On the prisoner’s wardrobe?” “Yes, that’s correct.” “Did someone else find it?” “No, I found it myself.” “So, you know where you found it?” “Yes, it was on the prisoner’s wardrobe.” “Good.” An employee from Parkson’s, Theatrical Costumiers, stated that on June 29th, they had provided Mr. L. Cavendish with a black beard as requested. The order was made by letter, along with a postal order. They did not retain the letter. All transactions were recorded in their records.",1
"CARTER, ""I've come across something that has caught my attention. It's possible that I am completely mistaken, but I highly doubt it. If my deductions are accurate, the girl in Manchester was a decoy. The entire situation was orchestrated, including the fake package, in order to throw us off the trail. It seems to me that we were getting close to the truth.   I believe I have identified the real Jane Finn, and I have a hunch about the whereabouts of the documents. It's purely speculative, but I have a gut feeling that it will prove to be correct. In any case, I have placed it in a sealed envelope, take it for what it's worth.""",1
"""After the bonds went missing from the trunk, a thorough search of the ship was conducted but yielded no results. It was discovered that the stolen bonds were sold in small parcels shortly after the ship docked in New York. This led to suspicions falling on Mr. Ridgeway. He was then searched and questioned, but the mystery remained unsolved. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Monsieur Hercule Poirot and his friend Captain Hastings decided to pay a visit to the Bank. Upon arrival, they were escorted to a small office where they met the joint general managers, Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, both of whom had dedicated their lives to the service of the Bank.""",1
"I need to get a full grasp of this Rand situation. The dancing was quite intense. I had a couple of dances with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to act like she was enjoying herself. There was one dance with Mrs. Blair, who didn't bother pretending, and I also danced with a few other ladies who caught my eye. Afterwards, we headed to supper. I had requested champagne; the steward recommended Clicquot 1911 as the top choice on the ship and I agreed. It turned out to be the key to getting Colonel Race to open up. Instead of his usual reserved self, he became surprisingly chatty.",1
"""And what about Number Four?"" I inquired. ""I am starting to grasp his methods now. It may seem amusing, Hastings, but understanding a man's character and predicting his actions is crucial. It's a game of wits between us, with him inadvertently revealing his thoughts to me while I keep mine hidden. He operates openly, while I lurk in the shadows. Let me tell you, Hastings, my deliberate inaction only serves to increase their fear of me each passing day.",1
"In the meantime, Jane Finn was suddenly struck with dread. What if they found her dead, a victim of Mr. Brown's hand? But then he chuckled at his own melodramatic thoughts. The doctor ushered them into a room. There, on a white bed with bandages wrapped around her head, lay the girl. The scene felt surreal, almost too perfectly staged. With wide, questioning eyes, the girl gazed at them. Sir James addressed her first. “Miss Finn,” he began, “this is your cousin, Mr.…”",1
"Poirot glanced at me with a raised eyebrow. ""Here we go!"" he whispered. ""You've already spotted a goddess!"" ""But, come on, wasn't she?"" I pressed. ""Possibly. I didn't take notice,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""You must have seen her?"" I insisted. ""My friend, two people hardly ever perceive the same thing. You, for example, saw a goddess. I,"" he paused. ""Yes?"" ""I only saw a girl with worried eyes,"" Poirot stated seriously. Just then, we arrived at a large green gate, and both of us gasped in unison. Standing before it was an imposing police officer. He signaled us to stop. ""You can't go through, gentlemen.",1
"After receiving a tempting job offer in Argentina, Tommy Beresford decided to accept it without hesitation. This brought a strange smile to Julius's face, who promptly tossed the letter aside in annoyance. ""What a fool,"" he muttered under his breath.   Following a call to Sir James, Tommy made his way to South Audley Mansions. Upon arrival, he met Albert, who was diligently carrying out his duties. Tommy wasted no time in introducing himself as a friend of Tuppence's, causing Albert to relax and express his longing for some excitement in the quiet surroundings.",1
"I struggled against the grip on my throat, biting and scratching in the most approved feminine fashion. The man had to keep me from crying out, hindering his movements. Despite my efforts, I felt myself weakening. Sensing this, my assailant put out all his strength. Suddenly, another shadow appeared, running on swift noiseless feet. With one powerful blow, he sent my opponent crashing to the deck. Finally released, I fell back against the rail, feeling sick and trembling.",1
"Despite the excruciating pain and my inability to shield my face, I struggled to maintain a specific course. I found myself spinning in all directions except the one I desired. Eventually, I reached my target, nearly brushing it with my tied hands. Yet, the task was far from simple. It required an eternity to maneuver the glass into a suitable position against the wall to rub against my restraints. The painstaking process nearly broke my spirit, but I persevered until I finally managed to cut through the ropes binding my wrists.",1
"Upon discovering the Countess Rossakoff's connection to the Big Four, I immediately launched an investigation into her background. It was uncovered that she had a child who was believed to have perished, but inconsistencies in the tale made me question if the child could still be alive. After an exhaustive search, I managed to locate the boy and secured his custody by offering a hefty sum. The child, in a pitiful state of malnourishment, was sheltered with caring individuals, where I discreetly captured a photograph of him in his unfamiliar environment.",1
"Poirot carefully surveyed the room, running his hand over the furniture and inspecting the cleanliness with approval. Suddenly, he straightened a crooked hearth-rug and discovered a small piece of paper hidden beneath it. Upon closer examination, it was revealed to be a torn fragment of a cheque, signed by M. Renauld to someone named Duveen. The commissary, flustered by his oversight, quickly turned to Madame Renauld for answers. With a renewed sense of determination, they left the room, leaving behind the mystery of the unexpected guest from the night before.",1
"""Japp noted, 'Turned away for a moment, and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.' I inquired about his thoughts on the case as we exited the gruesome chamber. 'Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!' he said, acknowledging my astonishment. 'Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past.'""",1
"His whole demeanor shifted when he chuckled. His face took on a youthful, joyful, almost unrecognizable appearance. I savored my soup, gently reminding him that he had yet to offer me his counsel. ""Ah, indeed, what I meant to suggest was this: If I were in your shoes, I would lay low here until you have fully recuperated. Your foes will assume you perished. They will not be surprised by the absence of your body. It would have been shattered against the cliffs and swept away by the current."" A chill ran down my spine. ""Once you have regained your strength, you can discreetly travel to Beira and secure passage on a ship bound for England."" ""That sounds dreadfully dull,"" I scoffed. ""That remark betrays a lack of wisdom.""",1
"""Will you promise it?” “Yes, absolutely,” replied the other eagerly. “I promise it.” Tuppence reached out a quivering hand towards the glass. “Alright.” Her lips parted obediently. Mrs. Vandemeyer breathed a sigh of relief, momentarily caught off guard. In a sudden movement, Tuppence lifted the glass with force. The liquid inside splattered onto Mrs. Vandemeyer’s face, causing her to gasp, and in that moment, Tuppence swiftly grabbed the revolver from the edge of the washstand with her right hand.",1
"""Mr. Carter sat silently, his tired demeanor evident. Occasionally, he would brush his lips, masking a hidden smile. After she had spoken, he nodded solemnly. “Not a lot to go on. But intriguing. Very intriguing. If I may be so bold, you two are an interesting pair. Who knows, maybe you'll accomplish what others could not. I've always believed in luck, you see.” He stopped briefly before continuing. “So, what do you say? Are you up for some excitement? How does the idea of working with me sound? Nothing official, of course.""",1
"I had to find a way to enter the room unnoticed, carefully observing my surroundings. A branch extending from the nearby tree caught my attention, offering a potential solution. Despite the uncertainty of its strength, I made the risky decision to crawl along it. As I inched forward, the branch groaned and wavered, heightening the danger of the situation. Ignoring the ominous drop below, I persevered until I reached my intended destination.",1
"“Renauld? Someone who was lurking near the Villa just before midnight that evening, someone who stood to gain from his demise – the shoe seems to fit Jack Renauld all too perfectly. The murder may not have been planned in advance. Ah, but then there’s the matter of the dagger!” My attention was suddenly piqued; I had overlooked this detail. “Indeed,” I mused. “The additional dagger discovered on the vagabond belonged to Mrs. Renauld. Two daggers in play, it seems.” “Indeed, and given that they were identical, it follows that Jack Renauld possessed the other. However, that aspect does not overly concern me. In fact, I have a notion or two regarding that.”",1
"""He managed to get the case dismissed, but it ruined two young men and left them to face the world as thieves. It devastated the old man, leading to a bitter confrontation with his son. The son, silent and proud, enlisted in the war with his friend, who ended up losing his life due to recklessness. The old man, revealing his bitterness towards a woman, took on a new identity and lived a numb existence on an island. But when he encountered a man who recognized him, he was stirred back to life. The man revealed his involvement in the robbery, his marriage to the woman, and the hidden diamonds. The old man, determined to clear his name, followed the man to England on a boat.""",1
"I caught a glimpse of her true nature - a proud, untamed creature, untouched by the constraints of society. She let out a cry, revealing the torment she endured in this despicable place. ""You have no idea,"" she exclaimed. ""I understand,"" I replied, urging her not to act impulsively. ""Impulsive?"" She scoffed at my caution. And then, to my regret, I blurted out, ""Dr. Bauerstein has been taken into custody."" Her face turned cold, devoid of emotion. ""John already informed me,"" she stated, her voice devoid of feeling.",1
"""Is he a small guy? Talks with his hands? A Belgian from the village?” “Yeah,” I replied excitedly. “He’s been around, huh?” “Oh, yeah, he’s been here, more than once. A friend of yours, eh? You Hall folks are a sight!” And he grinned even more playfully. “So, do the Hall people visit here a lot?” I inquired casually. He winked knowingly. “One does, sir. No need to say who. And quite generous too! Oh, thank you, sir, much obliged.” I continued on my way quickly.",1
"As we embarked on our journey, I couldn't contain my excitement. The fresh air filled me with joy and anticipation for the trip ahead. Despite my cheerful outlook, my companion reminded me of the impending task awaiting us at our destination. I waved off his concerns, confident in his ability to unravel the mysteries that lay ahead. With Hercule Poirot by my side, success was surely within reach. But as I teased him about his renowned skills, he simply gazed at me solemnly, sensing something amiss. It seemed as though he saw through my facade, recognizing a sense of foreboding lurking beneath my optimistic demeanor.",1
"""Pagett, my dear,"" I exclaimed, ""why must the unfortunate fellow be shadowed every time he steps on deck? Some individuals even endure the discomfort of sleeping outside. I've always found it rather unpleasant. The crew hoses down the deck, along with anyone on it, at five in the morning."" The very thought made me cringe. ""In any case,"" I added, ""if you insisted on disturbing some unfortunate soul suffering from insomnia, it's no surprise he lashed out at you."" Pagett appeared understanding. ""Allow me to explain, Sir Eustace. I was certain the man had been lurking near your cabin, where he had no legitimate reason to be.""",1
"She appeared more confused than ever. ""Are you suggesting that I stay at Madame Colombier's? And for how long?"" ""It could be as long as three months,"" he replied. ""Are there any other stipulations?"" she inquired. ""Absolutely none. You would pose as my ward and must refrain from contacting anyone you know. I must insist on complete secrecy for the time being. By the way, you're English, correct?"" ""Yes,"" she confirmed. ""But there's a hint of an American accent,"" he pointed out. ""I spent a lot of time with an American girl in the hospital. I must have picked it up from her. But I can easily shed it,"" she explained. ""Actually, it might be easier for you to pass as an American,"" he suggested.",1
"“Sorry old pal, I held back on purpose. What a shame. Money down the drain.” He let out a sigh. “But oh well. The ad’s out, only two responses!”  “Tommy, you sly dog!” Tuppence nearly yelled. “Hand them over. That was low!”  “Watch it, Tuppence. They’re strict at the National Gallery. Government gig.

"""Good day, gentlemen. Yesterday, you questioned me regarding the vanishing of Mr. Halliday. I have since discovered that you revisited the residence for a second time, inquiring about my assistant, Inez Veroneau. She accompanied you from the premises and has not been seen since.""

The intruders attempted to access something even more precious, but fortunately, they were unable to crack the large safe."" ""Madam, these are the details of the situation. Your former assistant, Madame Veroneau, was in reality the Countess Rossakoff, a skilled thief, and it was she who orchestrated Mr. Halliday's disappearance.""",1
"I climbed the stairs, determined to locate the room where the tragedy had unfolded. The rain from the day the body was found had left muddy footprints all over the uncarpeted floor. I doubted the police would have found any clues the day after, given the fine weather. The room itself was unremarkable, with white walls and a bare floor. Despite my thorough search, I found nothing of interest, until my pencil rolled under a window seat. Opening the cupboard underneath, I discovered a roll of Kodak films that piqued my interest. The films smelled strongly of mothballs, leading me to believe they belonged to the man killed in the Tube. This discovery gave me a new lead to pursue in the case.",1
"“Rome.” “Ah!” exclaimed Tuppence reflectively. Silently she mused: “I can't imagine my father being happy about this. Mr. Smith doesn't strike me as the type to deceive.” “Absolutely,” Smith added. “Isn't it just perfect? Going back in time, just a little bit, to revisit one of those lovely boarding schools for girls that Paris is known for.” Tuppence interjected. “A boarding school?” “Precisely. Madame Dubois' on Rue de la Paix.” Tuppence was familiar with the establishment. It was renowned for its exclusivity. She had a few American acquaintances who attended there.",1
"I wonder what motivated him to act in such a way. Was it for the sake of those small jade figures? Or could he possibly be working for the notorious Big Four? Personally, I am inclined to believe the latter. No matter how precious the jade may be, it is unlikely that a man of his social standing would fully comprehend its value, let alone resort to murder for it. (One would think that this would have been obvious to the Inspector.) He easily could have taken the jade and fled with it instead of carrying out such a savage and senseless killing. It appears that our acquaintance from Devonshire may not have engaged his little gray cells in this matter.",1
"""The depth of his intellect is well hidden, but undeniable,"" I remarked. Harvey nodded in agreement, his expression turning somber. ""The pieces are falling into place,"" Poirot declared, his tone grave. ""Are all the necessary preparations in place?"" ""Your instructions have been followed to the letter. The support of Italy, France, and England has been secured,"" I assured him. ""It appears we have forged a new alliance,"" Poirot mused dryly. ""Desjardeaux has finally come around. Well then, it is time to begin, or rather, for me to begin.""",1

Anne Beddingfeld expressed relief at traveling during daylight, marveling at the magnificent scenery. Colonel Race informed her that they only had three trains a week to Rhodesia, leading to a discussion about their plans at the Falls and Johannesburg. Race's assurance about the safety of Jo'burg prompted a skeptical response from Sir Eustace, who suspected Race had ulterior motives involving Anne. The dynamic between the characters hinted at underlying tensions and unspoken desires.",1
"As I pondered my grim situation, a sudden strategy formed in my mind. The concept of memory loss was a fascination of mine, a topic I had extensively researched.

The effect was immediate - Mrs. Vandemeyer emerged from behind the screen, intrigued by my unexpected linguistic display.",1

It’s been passed down through the family for generations, but it’s not tied to any inheritance. However, finding a buyer isn’t as simple as it seems. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden dealer, is in search of a potential customer, but time is running out.” Lady Yardly interjected with one more question, “Which plan does she agree with?” “She strongly objects to selling the jewel,” Lord Yardly replied.",1

The mention of his name caused him to recoil. He approached me. 'Why do you say we will meet again?' 'Because I have a feeling our paths will cross once more.' 'Not if I have a say in it!' His words were forceful, but I remained unfazed.""",1
"She made it clear to me that Sir Eustace lived his life with a strong focus on feeling secure and at ease. His self-preservation instinct was sharp. The death of Nadina removed some of his inhibitions. His actions were driven by his intense fears for his own safety, rather than his feelings towards me. I believe Suzanne is correct. As for Nadina, she was the type of woman who brought death upon herself. While men may resort to questionable means to become wealthy, women should not feign love for hidden agendas. I can pardon Sir Eustace quite easily, but I will never be able to forgive Nadina.",1
"John was once a barrister, but eventually embraced the quieter life of a country squire after marrying two years ago. He brought his wife to live at Styles, although it was clear he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance so he could have his own home.

However, the amount of money offered was so substantial that, for the first time, I found myself enticed by the sheer monetary value. It was not just a sum, but a significant fortune! Additionally, there was another aspect that caught my attention - you, my dear friend. As of late, I have been a solitary individual, yearning for companionship.",1
"""You're not thinking of turning Madame Olivier in to the authorities?""  ""I doubt they would believe me. She's practically a national treasure. And we have no evidence. We'll be lucky if she doesn't report us.""  ""What do you mean?""  ""Consider this. We're caught on her property at night with keys she'll deny giving us. She catches us at the safe, we restrain her, and then flee. Don't be naive, Hastings. The tables are turned, isn't that how you put it?""  Following our ordeal at the villa in Passy, we hurried back to London. Poirot had a stack of letters waiting for him. A sly grin crossed his face as he read one, then passed it to me.",1
"""But, considering it's all in the past and the conflict has ended, why does it still hold importance?"" ""History has a way of coming full circle, Jane. There was an uproar about those documents, then it faded away, and now the whole situation has resurfaced for entirely different reasons. Can you deliver them to us immediately?"" ""I'm afraid I can't."" ""What do you mean?"" ""I don't have them."" Julius emphasized each word with brief pauses. ""I don't have them?"" ""No, I concealed them."" ""You hid them?"" ""Yes. I became anxious. It felt like someone was monitoring me. It frightened me deeply."" She reached for her head.",1
"""He never wavered, always steady. It was like watching a master magician at work. “Your hand is remarkably steady,” I noted. “I can only recall one instance of it shaking.” “Undoubtedly in a fit of anger,” Poirot calmly remarked. “Yes, indeed! You were furious. Remember? When you found the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room had been tampered with. You stood by the mantel, fidgeting with the items on it as usual, hand trembling uncontrollably! I must admit ” But I abruptly cut myself off.""",1
"""Listen, my friend, I understand your feelings on this dreadful matter. I have not handled it well! If you were in my position, you might have handled it better! Fine! Let's move on from it and grab some lunch."" By the time we arrived at Poirot's place, it was around four o’clock. A man stood up from a seat near the window. It was Lord Yardly. He appeared worn out and troubled. ""I received your message and hurried here. I went to Hoffberg, but they deny any knowledge of their employee from last night or the telegram. Could it be that"" Poirot interrupted him. ""I apologize! I sent that telegram and recruited the man in question.""",1
"Hunter’s Lodge is managed by a housekeeper who efficiently handles all our needs during our occasional weekend visits. When the shooting season arrives, we bring along some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace (my mother was a Miss Pace of New York), has been living with us for the past three years. He never had a good relationship with my father or my elder brother, but I suspect that my somewhat rebellious nature only strengthened his fondness for me.",1
"As we were leaving the room, I leaned in towards Poirot and asked quietly, ""Will there be an inquest?"" Poirot, lost in thought, absentmindedly nodded in response. His preoccupation piqued my curiosity, prompting me to press further. ""What troubles you? You seem distracted."" ""It is true, my friend. I am greatly concerned."" ""And why is that?"" ""Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee."" ""What? Are you serious?"" ""Quite serious. There is a mystery here that eludes me. My initial hunch was correct."" ""What hunch?"" ""The one that led me to inspect those coffee cups.""",1
"I gasped in horror at the sight of the airplane dagger. Maître Grosíer immediately interjected, insisting on speaking to his client before any questions were answered. Jack Renauld, however, disregarded Grosíer's pleas and calmly confirmed, ""Yes, I recognize it. It was a gift from me to my mother, a reminder of the War."" When asked about the possibility of a duplicate dagger, Jack confidently stated, ""To my knowledge, there is none. The design was unique to me."" The magistrate was taken aback by the audacity of Jack's response.",1
"""Maybe,"" she replied before swiftly exiting the small clearing, leaving John frozen in place. I casually approached, crunching dead branches beneath my feet. John spun around, assuming I had just arrived on the scene.   ""Hello, Hastings. Did you make sure the little guy got back to his cottage safely? Quite an interesting fellow! But is he truly any good?""   ""He was renowned as one of the top detectives of his time.""   ""Well, I guess there must be some truth to it then. But what a miserable world we live in!""   ""Do you really think so?"" I inquired.",1
"We must act quickly if we hope to catch the culprit,"" the manager declared, swiftly producing the key. Without hesitation, we made our way into the apartment. Our first stop was a compact square lounge. A partially open door on the right caught the manager's attention. ""The dining area,"" he muttered, gesturing towards it. Dr. Hawker took the lead, with us close behind. Stepping into the room, I couldn't help but gasp. The table at the center still held the remnants of a meal, while three chairs were pushed away, as if their occupants had only just departed.",1
"""I've always heard that he acquired his wealth in a secretive manner,"" mused Suzanne. ""But that doesn't necessarily imply criminal activity. It could be something as mundane as selling office supplies or beauty products!"" I responded with a hint of regret. ""Perhaps,"" Suzanne hesitated, ""we're on the wrong track? What if we're being misled by suspecting Pagett's involvement? What if he's truly an upright citizen?"" I pondered this briefly before shaking my head. ""I find that hard to believe."" ""He does have an explanation for everything."" ""True, but they lack credibility.""",1
"""I was preparing for a lengthy journey, unsure when I would return. It was important for me to see her one last time, to make sure she knew my feelings were unwavering."" Poirot maintained unbreakable eye contact as he questioned Renauld's actions. After a significant pause, Renauld finally responded, confirming that he did see her. ""What happened next?"" Poirot pressed. ""I missed the final train, so I trekked to St. Beauvais and managed to secure a car from a nearby garage to transport me back to Cherbourg."" ""St. Beauvais? That's quite a distance to walk, M. Renauld."" ""I needed the time to think."" Poirot nodded in understanding as Renauld made his exit, grabbing his hat and cane before disappearing into the night.",1
"In late April, I managed to secure a meeting with the Home Secretary. Mr. Crowther's demeanor echoed that of Dr. Ridgeway. It exuded calmness and reservation. Despite acknowledging my offer to help, he politely refused. The documents mentioned by Poirot were now in his possession, and he assured me that every possible measure was being taken to address the looming threat. With that bleak reassurance, I had no choice but to accept. Mr. Crowther concluded our conversation by advising me to go back to South America. The whole situation left me deeply dissatisfied. I should have probably included Poirot's burial at the appropriate time.",1
"I noticed careful footsteps approaching, causing me to writhe in helplessness. As they neared, Poirot emerged, tilting his head and scanning the darkness. Suddenly, Ryland triumphantly growled as he aimed his gun and demanded, ""Hands up."" Deaves swiftly seized Poirot from behind. The trap was set. ""Nice to see you, Mr. Hercule Poirot,"" the American said sternly. Poirot remained unfazed, maintaining his composure without hesitation.",1
"""Looking down at the body, he furrowed his brow. ""Would you classify this individual as Spanish?"" he inquired abruptly. Studying the features intently, I finally replied, ""No, without a doubt I would identify him as French."" Giraud expressed his dissatisfaction with a grunt. ""I concur."" After a brief pause, he motioned for me to step aside with authority and resumed his meticulous search of the shed floor on all fours. His attention to detail was exceptional. Methodically, he combed through every inch of the area, scrutinizing pots and inspecting old sacks.""",1
"And the woman disappeared into thin air. Her box was left behind, containing only ordinary apparel. Mrs. Havering hired her through Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency with impeccable references. Mrs. Middleton's sudden disappearance raised suspicions, leading to an investigation. It was discovered that no woman named ""Mrs. Middleton"" had ever been registered with the Agency. Poirot deduced that Zoe Havering, a former actress, had orchestrated the whole scheme. She had disguised herself as the housekeeper to provide an alibi for her mistress. The clever and daring Zoe had fooled everyone with her quick changes and deception.",1
"""It shatters my hypothesis; it devastates everything... no!"" He suddenly halted, hitting his chest. ""It's inconceivable. I can't be mistaken! The evidence, approached systematically and in the correct sequence, only allows for one interpretation. I must be correct! I am correct!"" ""But then..."" I began. He cut me off. ""Wait, my dear. I must be correct, therefore this recent homicide is implausible unless unless oh, hold on, I beg of you. Don't say a word."" After a brief pause, he returned to his usual demeanor, speaking calmly and confidently: ""The deceased is a middle-aged man.""",1
"She placed her small hand gently in mine. ""Please, be a dear,"" she whispered. Reluctantly, I agreed. Deep down, I knew that I might actually enjoy playing the role of a showman. The girl's moral stance was not my concern. Despite some nerves about the examining magistrate's reaction, I consoled myself with the thought that no real harm could come of this. Our first stop was the location where the body was found. A guard stood watch, offering a respectful salute upon seeing me, without questioning my companion. Evidently, he assumed she was under my protection.",1
"""In that instant of frigid rationality, I berated myself for being overly theatrical, longing for the quiet monotony of Smallington. These thoughts raced through my mind in a mere moment. Instinctively, I inched backwards, searching for the door handle. The man holding me captive smirked. ""You're here now, and here you will remain,"" he said jokingly. Trying to appear brave, I stated, ""I was brought here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.""",1
"""The situation was undeniably perplexing. Although it was evident that the woman herself was not the perpetrator of the crime, as Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall when the gunshot rang out, there was undoubtedly a connection to the murder, given her sudden decision to flee. I immediately sent a message to Poirot and proposed heading back to London to investigate at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s response came swiftly: “No point in checking at the agency, they won’t have any information on her. Discover which vehicle transported her to hunters lodge upon her initial arrival.”""",1
"""We won't be needing it at the moment."" ""But what if he tries to run away?"" Poirot chuckled. ""He won't."" I quickly fetched the taxi that was waiting. The stranger's scarf was removed from his face, and I was taken aback. ""He's not Japanese,"" I whispered to Poirot. ""You always had a keen eye for observation, Hastings! You don't miss a thing. No, he's not Japanese. He's Italian."" We entered the taxi, and Poirot instructed the driver to go to an address in St. John's Wood. I was now thoroughly puzzled.",1
"His situation was dire. When he heard the key turn at eight o’clock, he immediately leaped up. The girl stood before him. ""Close the door,"" he ordered. ""I need to talk to you."" She complied. ""Listen, Annette, I need your assistance to escape this predicament."" She shook her head. ""It's impossible. There are three individuals on the level below."" ""Ah!"" Tommy was inwardly thankful for the insight. ""But you would aid me if you could?"" ""No, sir."" ""And why is that?"" The girl paused. ""I believe they are my associates. You've been spying on them. It's only right for them to detain you.""",1
"""I stood outside waiting, but they never emerged. Eventually, I ventured inside. Sir Eustace, the shop was deserted! There must be an alternate exit,"" I informed him. ""Upon my return to the hotel, I inquired about Miss Pettigrew."" Pagett leaned in, his voice hushed and breath heavy with the weight of confidentiality. ""Sir Eustace, a witness saw a man exiting her room last night."" Arching my eyebrows, I commented, ""And I had always believed her to be a woman of impeccable reputation."" Ignoring my remark, Pagett continued, ""I proceeded directly to her room and conducted a thorough search.""",1
"""A man facing his fate often seeks solace in a final smoke,"" I remarked, reaching for my cigarette case. ""May I?"" I inquired, glancing at my restraints. ""Ah, I see!"" she chuckled. ""You wish for your hands to be free, don't you? You are quite astute, M. Hercule Poirot, I must admit. I won't release your hands, but I can offer you a cigarette."" As she knelt beside me, she retrieved a cigarette from my case and placed it delicately between my lips. ""Now, a match,"" she stated as she stood up. ""It's not needed, madame."" There was a certain edge in my tone that caught her off guard. ""Please remain still, madame. I implore you. You will not like the consequences if you don't.""",1
"""Well, I'm shocked! If that's the case,"" Julius quickly interjected. ""Hold on now, let's not rush. I don't mean what you think. I believe Americans value morality even more than you do. What I meant was that the French approach marriage in a methodical manner, finding compatible partners, managing finances, and handling the entire situation practically, with a business mindset."" ""In my opinion,"" Tommy remarked, ""we're far too focused on business these days. Everything is about profit. The men are problematic enough, and the women are even worse!"" ""Calm down, my boy. Don't get so agitated.",1
"Colonel Race stood up. “Good morning Lucas,” he greeted. Harry suddenly blushed deeply. “Yes, I suppose it’s time to use your true name,” I joked. But Harry's attention remained fixed on Colonel Race. “You recognize me, sir,” he finally admitted. “I have a good memory for faces. I remember seeing you when I was a child.” Confused, I interjected, trying to understand the tension between them. Colonel Race prevailed. Harry shifted his gaze. “I guess you’re right, sir. Go ahead and tell her my real name.” “Anne, this man is not Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas died during the War.”",1
"""Now, my dear Suzanne, we must act quickly and decisively. Pagett will remain here, which means you have the perfect opportunity to join us in Rhodesia,"" I said, gripping Suzanne's hand tightly. ""If you were there when he arrived, everything would fall into place naturally. And let's not forget about Colonel Race and Sir Eustace entirely."" Suzanne dimpled and replied, ""Surely you can't suspect them?"" ""I suspect everyone,"" I said mysteriously. ""In detective stories, the most unlikely person is often the culprit. Cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace have been known to be criminals."" Suzanne agreed to keep an eye on Sir Eustace and promised to send a telegram if he showed any suspicious changes.",1
"""Unbelievable! I can't wrap my head around it! Kids playing, picnics, crowds of people everywhere! No way it's there! The odds are a million to one against it! It defies all logic!"" The sheer impossibility of it all weighed heavily on him, especially considering the failures of so many before him. It seemed too simple, too easy to be true. The hole had to be empty. Julius grinned at him, amusement dancing in his eyes. ""Looks like you're feeling the pressure now,"" he said, drawing out the words. ""Well, let's find out!"" With a confident motion, he reached into the crevice, a faint grimace crossing his face.",1
"He entered through the same entrance, murdered the elderly gentleman, then returned to the kitchen. You can clearly see the traces of blood he left behind. The kitchen appeared undisturbed as the entire town had been wandering through it. Instead of heading straight to his room, he revisited the crime scene. Was it to retrieve the small jade statues? Or was there some incriminating evidence he had overlooked? ""Maybe he committed the murder during his second visit,"" I proposed. ""No, you're not paying attention.",1
"As the time approached for my departure, a sense of melancholy overcame me. Would he release me without a word or gesture? His brooding silences and sudden outbursts of restlessness kept me on edge. The breaking point arrived one evening as we sat outside the hut, the setting sun casting long shadows. My hair, lacking the confinement of hairpins, cascaded down my back in a dark, straight curtain. Lost in my thoughts, I pondered my next move.",1
"""I never trusted you,"" she said sharply. ""It's not that simple,"" he replied. ""I had grown cynical and suspicious, always searching for hidden agendas. Your care and concern felt like a breath of fresh air."" As he spoke, she couldn't help but notice inconsistencies in his story - promises of money, talk of buying back stolen diamonds, and a deliberate distance in his descriptions of the men involved. And then she realized, when he said ""my friend,"" he wasn't referring to Eardsley, but to Lucas. It was Lucas, the unassuming one, who had been in love with Nadina all along.",1
"I had been learning Spanish, and my professor mentioned a need for assistance in a clinic in Madrid. I reached out and my offer was promptly accepted. With no immediate family to consider, making arrangements was a simple task.   Following the sinking of the Titanic, a stranger approached me. His apprehensive demeanor had caught my attention earlier, leading me to believe he was running from someone or something. In a hushed tone, he inquired about my patriotism to America and revealed he was in possession of crucial documents for the Allies. He implored me to safeguard them until a specific signal was given. Should the signal fail to materialize, I was to deliver the documents to the U.S. Embassy.",1
"""That's the alternative and you won't like it, I can tell you! I can be very rough if I choose. So drink this down like a good girl, and you'll be none the worse for it."" In her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her. The arguments she had adduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of getting her out of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the girl did not take kindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep without as much as one bid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs. Vandemeyer gave them the slip, the last hope of finding Tommy would be gone. Tuppence was quick in her mental processes.",1
"I couldn't believe my luck when I saw my target casually sipping beef tea by the rail. I approached him with a friendly smile, hoping to smooth things over after the cabin mix-up. Mr. Chichester, however, was not so forgiving. As we exchanged words, I couldn't help but notice that his skin was surprisingly fair for someone who claimed to have spent two years in the depths of Africa. His reaction to a dropped paper only deepened my suspicions. It was clear that Mr. Chichester was not to be trusted. Later, during a conversation about Italy, the strange behavior of Mr. Pagett only added to my growing list of suspects. The more I observed, the more I realized that any one of them could be hiding something sinister.",1
"""I doubt anyone has come through here. Just look at the dust. Thick. No footprints anywhere,"" Julius remarked as they explored the abandoned building. Dust coated every surface, undisturbed. Julius expressed his disbelief that Tuppence had ever set foot in the house. Tommy suggested they revisit the next day in daylight for a closer look. The following day, they resumed their search and reluctantly agreed that the house had been untouched for quite a while. Just as they considered leaving the village, Tommy made a fortunate discovery that changed their course.",1
"Upon investigating, we notice three instances where M. Renauld's behavior shifts dramatically, indicating three crucial psychological turning points. The first occurs upon his arrival in Merlinville, the second following a heated argument with his son, and the third on the morning of June 7th. The reasons behind these changes are as follows: the influence of Madame Daubreuil is to blame for the first, the impending marriage between Renauld's son and Daubreuil's daughter for the second, but the root cause of the third remains elusive, requiring deduction on our part.",1
"""It's a tight squeeze. Jane's hand must be a few sizes smaller than mine. I don't feel anything, no sir, what's this? Oh my goodness!"" And with a dramatic gesture he held up a small discoloured packet. ""It's the real deal. Wrapped in oilskin. Hold onto it while I grab my pocket knife."" The impossible had occurred. Tommy cradled the precious packet delicately in his hands. They had prevailed! ""It's odd,"" he muttered absentmindedly, ""you'd think the seams would have decayed. They look brand new."" They sliced them meticulously and peeled off the oilskin. Enclosed was a tiny folded piece of paper.",1
"“Mr. Hersheimmer,” he said at last, “that is a very large sum.” “I guess it’ll have to be. These aren’t the kind of folk to offer sixpence to.” “At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two hundred and fifty thousand pounds.” “That’s so. Maybe you think I’m talking through my hat, but I can deliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for your fee.” Sir James flushed slightly. “There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a private detective.” “Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I’ve been feeling bad about this money question.",1
"""I was quite fond of the young woman, she possessed an air of genuineness and simplicity that I found refreshing. It was clear that she had something weighing on her mind, and eventually she revealed it to me. ""Major Neville,"" she began, ""I have been contemplating resigning from my position here."" I was taken aback by this revelation, and she continued with urgency. ""You see, as grateful as I am for this opportunity, I simply cannot tolerate being verbally abused. It is utterly intolerable to me. No true gentleman would behave in such a manner."" ""Has Ryland been the one to mistreat you?"" She silently confirmed this with a nod.""",1
"Poirot listened intently as Marthe revealed a shocking revelation. She described a confrontation between M. Renauld and a tramp in the garden, hinting that they might be the same person. Poirot pondered over the implications of her story, considering the possibility that Jack Renauld might have murdered his own father for money. As they made their way back to the Villa, Poirot's mind raced with new suspicions and clues. Suddenly, a car pulled up outside with Giraud, Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes. Poirot hastily searched through Jack Renauld's belongings, finding a crucial piece of evidence hidden among ties and handkerchiefs. With a triumphant cry, he pocketed the item and hurriedly left the room before Giraud could interfere.",1
"Mr. Lowen expressed his apologies and bid farewell. ""Everyone is aware that Mr. Davenheim never came back. The police were notified early Sunday morning, but were baffled by the situation. Mr. Davenheim appeared to have disappeared without a trace. He had not visited the post office, nor had he been spotted in the village. Authorities confirmed he had not left by train. His personal vehicle remained in the garage. If he had arranged for a car to meet him in a remote location, it is likely that the driver would have come forward by now, given the substantial reward for any information.""",1
"As Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes scanned the room, she reclined in her seat. ""Bah!"" she exclaimed. ""You're missing something."" Tuppence conceded, ""Yes, I may be, but I know someone who isn't."" ""Who might that be?"" inquired Mrs. Vandemeyer skeptically. ""A close associate of mine,"" replied Tuppence. ""He happens to be quite wealthy,"" Mrs. Vandemeyer remarked doubtfully. ""Indeed, he is a millionaire. An American, to be precise. He will provide the payment without hesitation. Trust me, it's a legitimate offer."" Mrs. Vandemeyer sat upright once more. ""I am inclined to trust you,"" she said slowly. After a period of silence, Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her gaze.",1
"""Oh, every detail! The location of the incident, the murder weapon, the victim, any fingerprints or other intriguing evidence. I never imagined I would be so close to a murder investigation like this. Will this memory haunt me forever?"" I walked away, feeling disgusted. What had society come to, with women finding excitement in such gruesome events? The girl's morbid enthusiasm made me feel sick to my stomach. I had heard of the crowds of women gathering outside courtrooms during capital trials, but I never understood who these women were until now.",1
"As they retraced their path back to the gate, a sudden cry escaped him. Bending down, he retrieved an item from the ground and presented it to Julius. It was a delicate gold brooch. “This belongs to Tuppence!” “Are you certain?” “Without a doubt. I’ve seen her wear it countless times.” Julius took a deep breath. “Well, that confirms it. She made it this far, at least. Let’s establish the pub as our base, and turn this area upside down until we locate her. Someone must have spotted her.” And so, the search commenced. Tommy and Julius conducted their investigations individually and together, yet the outcome remained unchanged. No one resembling Tuppence had been sighted in the vicinity. They were puzzled but undeterred.",1
"""I am at your disposal,” the woman stated, her gaze filled with suspicion. “I expect your full cooperation.” “I will gladly assist in Alfred's demise,” she growled. “Hanging is too kind a fate. He deserves to suffer more, as in the past.” “Then we share the same goal,” declared Poirot. “I also seek justice for the crime.” “Alfred Inglethorp?” “Whether him or another.” “There is no doubt it was him. Emily was unharmed until he appeared. She was vulnerable, but her life was never in danger. Until Mr. Smith showed up.""",1
"I suggested they may have departed on the midnight train, but he firmly dismissed the notion. He was confident he would have noticed two foreigners among the twenty or so passengers that left. I couldn't pinpoint what triggered my suspicion, perhaps the anxious tone of Marthe Daubreuil. Suddenly, I inquired: ""Young M. Renauld, he didn't board that train, did he?"" ""No, sir. Arriving and departing within half an hour is hardly entertaining,"" he replied. The man's words held a deeper meaning that almost eluded me.",1
"I couldn’t shake the memory of her close proximity on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers handed me the packet. She had attempted to engage him in conversation more than once. Fear began to creep in, but I was unsure of the best course of action. A fleeting thought of stopping at Holyhead instead of continuing on to London crossed my mind, but I quickly dismissed it as pure folly. The only option was to feign ignorance and remain vigilant. I believed that if I stayed on guard, they wouldn’t be able to catch me. As a precaution, I had already replaced the contents of the oilskin packet with blank paper and resealed it.",1
"Upon entering the room with Gerald Paynter and the compliant Chinaman, they were met with a horrifying scene. Mr. Paynter's body lay sprawled in front of the gas fire, his features unrecognizable due to severe burns. Initially assumed to be a tragic accident, suspicion soon shifted to Doctor Quentin for administering a sedative and leaving the patient unattended. However, a peculiar detail emerged when a newspaper was found on the ground, having slipped from the deceased man's lap.",1
"With a peaceful night's rest, the boy could be fully recovered by morning, but any excitement might lead to dangerous brain fever. It was decided that someone should stay by his side throughout the night. After doing all we could, we entrusted Marthe and her mother with his care and headed into town. By this time, we were both starving, having missed our usual dinner hour. Luckily, the first restaurant we found satisfied our hunger with a delicious omelette and an equally satisfying entrecôte. ""Now we must find lodgings for the night,"" Poirot remarked after finishing our café noir.",1
"""But Poirot's skills surpassed mine. In mere moments, he uncovered the entire tale, his eyes gleaming with amusement. “Ah! A story filled with romance. What is the name of this captivating young woman?” I had to admit that I was unaware. “Even more romantic! The initial encounter on the Paris train, the subsequent one here. Journeys conclude with lovers’ reunions, is that not the saying?” “Stop being ridiculous, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Truly, you possess the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You ought to establish a harem!” “It’s easy for you to mock me.""",1
"""But now everything is clear to me."" ""You have all the answers?""""I have unraveled what M. Renauld wanted me to uncover.""""And you know who the killer is?""""I am aware of one killer.""""What are you trying to say?""""We seem to be talking past each other. There are not one, but two crimes here. I have cracked the first, but as for the second, well, I must admit, I am uncertain!""""But, Poirot, didn't you claim that the man in the shed died of natural causes?""""Tsk tsk tsk."" Poirot let out his signature sigh of impatience. ""You still don't grasp it. A crime can exist without a murderer, but in the case of two crimes, two bodies are indispensable.""",1
"""Monitoring Mr. Inglethorp was part of my strategy, waiting for him to reveal the hiding spot. Unfortunately, he outsmarted me at every turn. The document remained secure in its original location, as it went unnoticed during the initial search. Without your astute observation, we wouldn't have closed in on him so quickly."" ""I see that clearly now. But what made you start questioning Miss Howard?"" ""My doubts arose when I caught her in a lie during the inquest regarding the letter from Mrs. Inglethorp.""",1
"Again the color drained from the other person's face. ""What makes you say that?"" ""I'm not sure,"" the girl replied honestly. ""But I just know."" Mrs. Vandemeyer gazed ahead silently for a while. ""Yes,"" she finally whispered, ""I understand. I used to be beautiful, you know, very beautiful."" ""You still are,"" Tuppence complimented. Mrs. Vandemeyer shook her head, a peculiar glint in her electric-blue eyes. ""Not beautiful enough,"" she murmured in a soft, menacing tone. ""Not beautiful enough! And sometimes, recently, I've been scared. It's risky to be too knowledgeable!"" Leaning in closer, she said, ""Promise me that my name won't be mentioned, that no one will ever find out."" ""I promise.""",1
"Arriving in one of London's dreary southern suburbs after a series of bus and train rides, Poirot finally decided to shed some light on the mysterious case we were working on together. I had been eager to discuss the details with him, as I believed he was making a mistake by keeping everything to himself. Despite my efforts to engage him in conversation, Poirot remained tight-lipped and enigmatic, true to his nature. His love for secrecy meant that he would only reveal crucial information at the eleventh hour, much to my frustration.",1
"And the inns suggest subtly that once the provisions run out, they will toss you onto the doorstep! Last evening, I encountered Reeves, my comrade from the Kilmorden. His nerves are shot worse than any other man I've come across. Like the rest of them, he delivers fiery speeches of great length, purely for political gain, only to regret it later. He's now running around claiming he never meant it. When I saw him, he was heading to Cape Town, where he plans to deliver a three-day speech in Dutch, defending himself and insisting that his previous statements had a completely different meaning. I am grateful that I'm not a member of the Legislative Assembly of South Africa.",1
"""Both individuals are currently in a state of suspension. I have shed my skirts and my fabric as well. Why not take a seat?” I calmly settled into a chair. “It appears,” I observed, “that I may have arrived at an incorrect location.” “Unfortunately, from your perspective, that seems to be the case. Miss Beddingfeld, falling into the same snare twice!” “Not the wisest move on my part,” I confessed humbly. There was something about my demeanor that seemed to puzzle him. “You don’t appear to be bothered by what happened,” he dryly remarked. “Would a dramatic reaction from me make any difference to you?” I inquired.",1
"As he dictated to Miss Pettigrew, her voice droned on monotonously. ""I therefore suggest that in addressing this issue of colored labor,"" she repeated. After a pause, he grunted something angrily. I quietly moved forward. Colonel Race's room appeared vacant, and he was nowhere to be seen in the lounge. He was the one I dreaded encountering the most. Nevertheless, I had no time to spare. Hurriedly, I exited the hotel and headed towards the bridge. Crossing it, I positioned myself in the shadows, ready and watchful. If someone followed me, I would spot them as they crossed the bridge.",1
"""I suspected someone was approaching from behind, but I couldn't confirm it. They wouldn't have been as close as I was,"" I told the investigator. Mr. Flemming, who accompanied me to the inquest, seemed anxious about my well-being, unaware of my composed facade. The victim, identified as L. B. Carton, had only a house-agent's order in his pockets to view a property near Marlow on the river. The document bore the name L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel.",1
"As she entered the room, Tuppence was struck by the grandeur of the collection of books on crime and criminology that lined one wall. The butler gestured for her to take a seat in one of the deep-padded leather arm-chairs by the old-fashioned open hearth. ""Sir James will see you now,"" he announced, before disappearing from the room. Tuppence couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation as she waited for the man who held the key to her important message.",1
"As I made my way back down the hall a few minutes later, the item had vanished."" Whether or not this assertion was accurate, it didn't appear to bode well for Inglethorp in my opinion. Regardless, he had plenty of opportunity to administer the poison. Just then, Poirot subtly gestured towards two individuals seated by the door. One was a small, sharp, dark man with a ferret-like face, while the other was tall and blonde. Without speaking, I inquired of Poirot. He leaned in and whispered in my ear, ""Do you recognize that little man?"" I shook my head in response.",1
"Poirot chuckled softly beside me when the doctor mentioned the absence of strychnine. Curious, I asked him how he knew. Poirot simply replied, ""Listen."" The doctor explained that strychnine's bitter taste could be detected even in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and that it could only be disguised by a strongly flavored substance. Cocoa, he said, would be ineffective at masking it. When asked about coffee, the doctor clarified that its own bitterness would likely cover up the taste of strychnine.",1
"""Upon reaching Paris, we made our way to Gare de l'Est, where Poirot finally revealed our next destination. Our journey was set for Bolzano and Italian Tyrol. While Harvey was away from our compartment, I seized the chance to inquire Poirot about why he credited me with discovering the rendezvous.  ""Because it was indeed your doing, my dear friend. I am unsure of how Ingles obtained the information, but he somehow did and had his servant deliver it to us. Our path leads us, mon ami, to Karersee, now known as Lago di Carezza.""",1
"""And what about Carton?""""Never mind him. He caught us with Nadina in Kimberley that one evening, but he couldn't tell us apart. I convinced him I was Lucas, and Nadina fell for it too. She never feared Lucas, he was too quiet and reserved. But I, I had a fiery temper. If she knew I was back, she would've been terrified.""""Harry, if Colonel Race hadn't intervened, what was your plan?""""To stay silent. Keep up the charade as Lucas.""""And the inheritance from your father?""""Let Race have it. He would put it to better use than I ever could.""",1
"“Would you mind sharing any information you have regarding Jane Finn?” “Jane Finn? Oh!” Mr. Carter paused, pondering. “The real question is, what information do you possess about her?” Tuppence straightened up. “I fail to see the relevance of that.” “Don’t you? But it's crucial, really.” He flashed a tired smile and contemplated further. “So, let’s get back to the point. What can you tell me about Jane Finn?” “Tell me,” he pressed on, sensing Tuppence's silence. “You must have some knowledge to have placed such an advertisement?” Leaning in slightly, his voice tinged with weariness, he added persuasively.",1
"""Known simply as 'Mr. Brown,' he is widely regarded as the preeminent criminal of our time, commanding a vast and intricate network. Much of the wartime Peace movement was secretly orchestrated and funded by him. His influence is pervasive."" Tommy inquired, ""Is he a German citizen?"" ""No,"" replied the source, ""There is strong evidence suggesting he is actually English. His allegiance lies with power, though his ultimate goal remains elusive. His true identity remains a mystery, even to those closest to him.""",1
"""I never would have questioned his authenticity for a second. Our time on Dartmoor seemed futile, with no progress made. I expressed my frustrations to Poirot, but he insisted that we were moving forward. 'We are learning more about his mind and tactics with each interaction,' Poirot explained. 'He remains unaware of us and our strategies.' I argued that we were at a standstill, waiting for the culprit to make a move. Poirot simply smiled and remarked, 'You never change, Hastings. Always eager for action.'""",1
"Poirot and Giraud were in deep conversation, surrounded by a crowd of curious onlookers. Suddenly, Giraud produced a surprising piece of evidence - a woman's hair coiled around the handle of the dagger. Poirot's interest was piqued as he pondered over the mysterious discovery. ""A woman's hair? Whose could it be?"" he mused. As they left the shed, Giraud's suave voice echoed in Poirot's mind. ""What game is he playing?"" wondered Poirot, intrigued by the unexpected turn of events. Later, over a hearty lunch, Poirot remained lost in thought, his mind clearly preoccupied with unraveling the tangled web of clues before him.",1
"""Was it Sir Eustace who underwent a test, or was the tale crafted for my benefit? I recalled feeling like I was being interrogated that night. Colonel Race seemed wary for some reason. But what was his involvement? ""Who exactly is Colonel Race?"" I inquired. ""That's a loaded question,"" Suzanne replied. ""He's famous as a big-game hunter and, as you heard him mention earlier, a distant relative of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I only just met him on this journey.""",1
"""Trust me, I've examined all the details. M. Jack Renauld came in on the train. There was an hour gap before he showed up at the house. It's clear that he saw Captain Hastings and his partner exit the shed, snuck in himself, grabbed the dagger, and stabbed his partner in the shed.""""But the partner was already dead!"" Giraud shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't realize that. Perhaps he thought the partner was just asleep. It's likely they had a meeting planned. Either way, he knew that this second murder would make the case much more complicated. And it did.""",1
"""As an afterthought,"" Poirot inquired, ""has M. Stonor visited Merlinville today?"" Madame Daubreuil calmly responded, ""Not to my knowledge."" Poirot continued, ""Has he met with Mrs. Renauld?"" ""I cannot say, monsieur,"" she replied. With a nod, Poirot concluded, ""I was simply curious if you had seen him around. Good night, madame."" I started to ask, ""Why?"" Poirot interrupted, ""No questions for now, Hastings. There will be opportunity later on.""",1
"As Sir Eustace paused mid-sentence, Miss Pettigrew, though efficient in appearance, startled at his sudden halt. “God bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “What of the man in Durban?” “I choose you,” I murmured. “My dear,” Sir Eustace whispered. “You may hold my hand now.” At once, Miss Pettigrew cleared her throat, causing Sir Eustace to retract his hand abruptly. “Ah, yes,” he continued. “Where were we? Ah, yes. Tylman Roos, during his speech...Why are you not jotting this down?” Colonel Race interjected gently, “I believe Miss Pettigrew's pencil has snapped.”",1
"I adored Falls, a place I cherished deeply. After dinner, Sir Eustace secluded himself with Miss Pettigrew. A mysterious note from Harry Rayburn urged me to the palm gully clearing. Hesitating, I set out, wary of being followed. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows and chased me. Panicked, I tripped and fell into darkness. Awakening in a strange room, I found Harry Rayburn sitting beside me. Grateful for his presence, I wept with relief. His comforting words and a cup of milk eased my fears. As I drifted back to sleep, I knew I was safe in his care.",1
"As we made our way back home, we passed through one of the gates and encountered a young woman with a gipsy-like appearance. She greeted us with a bow and a smile. ""She's quite lovely,"" I commented. John's expression turned cold. ""That's Mrs. Raikes."" ""The one that Miss Howard..."" ""Yes,"" John interjected sharply. My thoughts drifted to the elderly woman at the grand estate, juxtaposed with the mischievous smile of the young woman. A sense of unease washed over me briefly, but I pushed it aside. ""Styles truly is a magnificent old estate,"" I remarked to John. He simply nodded, his demeanor somber.",1
"I had survived multiple attempts on my life by him, witnessed him murder an innocent woman, and was aware of his involvement in numerous other crimes unbeknownst to me. Despite this knowledge, I couldn't bring myself to fully comprehend the gravity of his actions. He remained in my eyes as a charming and affable companion on our travels. Strangely, I couldn't muster any fear towards him, despite knowing his capacity to order my execution without hesitation. The only comparison I could draw was to Stevenson's infamous character, Long John Silver.",1
"""Tell me, what has caught your interest?"" I asked confidently, although half-expecting him to mock my suspicions. To my astonishment, he nodded in agreement. ""You are correct, Hastings. I have always had a feeling that she was withholding something. Initially, I had my doubts about her, suspecting her involvement, if not direct, then at least indirect."" ""You suspected her?"" I exclaimed. ""Absolutely! She stands to gain significantly from this new will, being the sole beneficiary. Therefore, she was immediately under my scrutiny. You might have noticed that I made a point of inspecting her wrists early on.""",1
"""Mademoiselle, it's fascinating hearing your insights on Mr. Darrell. Women truly are remarkable observers, catching the smallest details that men overlook. I recall a woman singling out a man from a group because she noticed his habit of touching his nose when nervous. Such keen perception is rare in men, wouldn't you agree?"" ""Absolutely!"" exclaimed Miss Monro. ""We definitely have a knack for picking up on things.""",1
"Hastings was adamant that it was Inglethorp who had destroyed the will, a fact that he had tried to emphasize to Poirot. Despite the overwhelming evidence pointing to Inglethorp's guilt, Hastings found himself doubting whether he was truly the culprit. The more he tried to exonerate Inglethorp, the more suspicious his actions became. It was only when Hastings realized that Inglethorp was actually trying to get himself arrested that he changed his mind. The truth was far more sinister than he could have ever imagined.",1
"I have been a professional in this business since my youth, always employing experts to carry out my schemes. Nadina was an exception, knowing too much for me to trust her. After her death, with the diamonds in my possession, I felt safe. However, I now realize that I made mistakes, especially in involving that fool Pagett. He may have a curious face and a traditional soul, but my sense of humor led me to keep him around. My dear Anne, never let your sense of humor cloud your judgment. I have always known it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but his work ethic made it hard to find a reason to let him go. As for you, my dear, the question remains: where are the diamonds now?",1
"I glanced up to find her eyes peering mischievously over the edge. Despite myself, a smile crept onto my face, prompting her to chuckle heartily and discard the paper. ""I knew you had some wit hidden beneath that facade,"" she exclaimed. Her laughter was so contagious that I couldn't resist joining in, even though I wasn't fond of being called a ""mutt."" Although the girl possessed qualities I typically found unappealing, I decided not to be overly serious. I relaxed my stance. In the end, she was undeniably attractive. ""See, we're pals now!"" she announced with a smirk.",1
"Poirot's calm voice broke the tense silence. ""Do as I say, quickly."" With trembling hands and a mix of anger and fear on her face, she obeyed his command. I felt a sense of relief. ""Your restraints will suffice for her, Hastings. Perfect. Is she secured? Now, set me free. Luckily, her accomplices are gone. If we're lucky, we can escape unhindered."" Moments later, Poirot was at my side, addressing the woman. ""I'm not so easily defeated, madame. Goodnight."" Her eyes held a dangerous glint, silenced by the gag.",1
"""I suspect that room is where we will discover Jack Renauld,"" I whispered to Poirot. Madame Daubreuil welcomed us in, mentioning that Jack's condition had not changed much, but she thought we might want to check on him ourselves. Up the stairs we went, entering the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil sat at a table, engrossed in her embroidery under the glow of a lamp. She gestured for silence as we approached. Jack Renauld lay in a restless slumber, his head tossing back and forth, his complexion still unusually red. ""Will the doctor return soon?"" Poirot inquired softly. ""Only if we request it. For now, let him rest,"" Madame Daubreuil replied.",1
"""Lady Yardly,"" I said, ""I know the reason behind your visit. You have been targeted by blackmailers regarding the diamond."" My words hit their mark, evident from the shock on her face. She stared at me, speechless and pale. ""You are aware?"" she gasped. ""How?"" I maintained my composure. ""It's a simple deduction. If Miss Marvell, with one of the twin diamonds, has received threatening letters,"" ""Miss Marvell? She was here?"" ""She just departed. So, if she's been warned, it follows that you, with the other diamond, would have also been a target.""",1
"Not that she doubted Tommy, but sometimes she questioned if someone as straightforward and sincere as him could truly outwit the cunning arch-criminal. The ultimate goal was to reach Sir James Peel Edgerton safely. But the looming question remained - would they make it to him? Could Mr. Brown's mysterious allies already be closing in on them? Even the image of Tommy with a gun did little to ease her mind. Perhaps he had already been outnumbered and subdued. Tuppence carefully strategized her next move.",1
"The policeman presented a key, signaling for entrance. Sir James was a familiar figure to all, as were the directives regarding Tuppence. However, the presence of the third individual remained shrouded in mystery. The trio proceeded into the residence, closing the door behind them. Ascending the unstable staircase, they reached the worn curtain concealing the alcove where Tommy once sought refuge. Recalling Jane's account as ""Annette,"" Tuppence examined the frayed velvet with curiosity. An eerie sensation crept over her, as if a hidden presence lurked behind the fabric.",1
"What an incredible chance for a skilled thief! Look over there, Hastings, that large woman standing next to the pillar. She is absolutely covered in jewels."" I followed his gaze. ""Oh my, that's Mrs. Opalsen."" ""You know her?"" ""A little. Her husband is a wealthy stockbroker who struck it rich in the recent Oil boom."" Later that evening we bumped into the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We exchanged pleasantries for a short while, and eventually enjoyed coffee together. Poirot complimented some of the more expensive gems adorning the lady's chest, and she immediately perked up. ""Collecting gems is a passion of mine, Mr.…""",1
"Poirot. My fondness for jewelry is well known. Ed always surprises me with a new piece whenever things are going smoothly. Do you have an interest in gemstones?” “I have had my fair share of experiences with them, madame. My line of work has led me to encounter some of the most renowned jewels in the world.” He proceeded to recount, using discreet aliases, the tale of the legendary jewels of a royal family, capturing Mrs. Opalsen's undivided attention. “Oh my!” she gasped, after he finished. “It's just like a scene from a play! You know, I possess some pearls with a fascinating backstory attached to them.",1
"""Magnificent, exquisite, magnificent,"" he exclaimed. ""Tonight, you have truly outdone yourself."" With a gallant gesture, he planted a kiss on each of her cheeks in a rather casual manner. Madame Nadina gracefully accepted the praise, a routine she had grown accustomed to, and made her way to the dressing room. The room was adorned with bouquets scattered haphazardly, modern garments hanging on hooks, and the air filled with a heady mix of floral scents and luxurious perfumes. Jeanne, the loyal dresser, attended to her mistress, chatting incessantly and showering her with exaggerated compliments. Suddenly, a knock at the door brought an abrupt halt to the conversation.",1
"As the butler entered, a telegram was presented to Lord Yardly on a silver platter. After a quick apology, he opened it and his expression changed. Passing it to his wife, he then turned to Monsieur Poirot. ""I believe you should be informed. Hoffberg has a potential buyer for the diamond - an American leaving for the States tomorrow. A representative will inspect the stone tonight. If this deal goes through..."" Lord Yardly's voice trailed off, his wife staring blankly at the telegram in her hand.",1
"Poirot and Hastings were deep in discussion, trying to unravel the mystery of the crime that had taken place. Poirot was convinced that the key to the case lay in the details surrounding Mr. Renauld's murder. As they debated various theories, Hastings suggested that perhaps the open door was a clue that had been overlooked. Poirot considered this idea, but shook his head, indicating that there was more to the case than met the eye. He was certain that the solution to the mystery lay elsewhere, and that the truth would soon be revealed.",1
"“You remember when you proposed,” Tuppence hesitated, her gaze fixed on the ground in a way that mirrored the classic Victorian heroines, “and wouldn’t accept no for an answer. I’ve pondered it at length ” “Go on,” Julius prompted. Beads of sweat formed on his brow. Tuppence’s expression softened. “You foolish man!” she exclaimed. “What possessed you to do it? I could tell back then that you didn’t give a damn about me!” “That’s not true. I held, and continue to hold, the utmost regard and admiration for you ” “Hmm,” Tuppence replied.",1
"I first encountered her in the town, a woman with a sharp sense of humor that sets her apart. Despite my enjoyment of our conversations, they are often interrupted by a long-legged, stoic individual who clings to her side like a barnacle. Colonel Race, as he is known, does not strike me as someone who truly entertains her. Handsome, yes, but about as interesting as a wet rag. He fits the mold of those strong, silent types that seem to captivate female writers and young girls alike. As we departed from Madeira, Guy Pagett emerged on deck, his voice hollow as he began discussing matters of work.",1
"I discovered later that the nurse who cared for me traveled to Paris and saw a specialist, pretending to be me. The specialist saw through her fake memory loss, but she memorized his methods and used them on me. I probably couldn't have fooled the specialist, a man who dedicated his life to his work, but I still managed to trick them. Not identifying as Jane Finn for so long helped. Suddenly, I was rushed to London one night and brought back to the house in Soho.",1
"""Afternoon. I'd like a word with you after we finish our tea,"" she said, her eyes darting towards Mary. A lack of understanding seemed to linger between them. It was the first time I thought about what would become of the young girl. Mrs. Inglethorp hadn't made any arrangements for her, but I suspected John and Mary would want her to stay with them, at least until the war was over. John cared deeply for her and would hate to see her leave. John, who had just stepped back into the house, returned with a rare expression of anger clouding his typically amiable face.""",1
"Papa’s circle consisted of elderly Professors, each sporting a lengthy beard. I recall a particular encounter with Professor Peterson, who once complimented my ""neat little waist"" before attempting to kiss me. His outdated phrasing revealed his true age. I longed for excitement, love, and passion, yet found myself trapped in a mundane existence. The village had a worn lending library, where I indulged in tales of adventure and romance, falling asleep to dreams of bold Rhodesians and men who triumphed effortlessly in combat.",1
"I made sure to thoroughly search the girl's belongings upon her arrival. ""Where did you suddenly pull that from? It wasn't there a moment ago,"" I questioned. ""Actually, it was,"" she responded calmly. ""I had it hidden in my stocking."" Sir Eustace lamented his lack of knowledge about women, admitting, ""I should have paid more attention to them."" Harry's patience wore thin as he slammed his hand on the table. ""Stop the nonsense. If it weren't for your age, I'd toss you out the window, you scoundrel! Age or no age,"" he growled, taking a few steps forward while Sir Eustace quickly retreated behind the table.",1
"Engrossed, I found myself slightly uplifted. My focus shifted to the passengers. A woman caught my eye. Around thirty years old, of average height, she had a round face with dimples and striking blue eyes. Her attire, while simple, exuded a certain Parisian elegance. There was a subtle air of authority as she effortlessly commanded the deck stewards. She had a designated deck-chair, along with a never-ending stack of cushions. Despite changing her mind multiple times on its placement, she maintained her allure and grace.",1
"They had delivered the package, as instructed, to “L. Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court.” Sir Ernest Heavywether stood up heavily. “Where was the message sent from?” “From Styles Court.” “The same location where you sent the package?” “Correct.” “And the message originated from there?” “Yes.” Heavywether pounced on him like a predator: “How can you be sure?” “I I am not sure.” “How do you know that message originated from Styles? Did you see the postmark?” “No but ” “Ah, you didn’t see the postmark! Yet you assert with such certainty that it came from Styles. It could have been from any postmark, couldn't it?” “Yes.",1
"Tuppence hesitated, feeling a shiver run down her spine. She opened the door cautiously, peering into the darkness beyond. With a deep breath, she stepped inside. The room was empty, but the air felt heavy with a sense of foreboding. Tuppence scanned the corners, her heart pounding in her chest. There was nowhere for anyone to hide. She scolded herself for letting her imagination run wild. Determined to regain her composure, Tuppence exited the room. Julius and Sir James were engrossed in conversation. As Sir James turned to her, he instructed, “Lock the door from the outside, Miss Tuppence, and keep the key. We can't risk anyone gaining access to that room.”",1
"Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one.",1
"On the luxurious estate of Styles Court, he and his wife basked in the care and generosity of his stepmother, their benefactress. The prisoner, known for his reckless spending and scandalous affair with a neighbor's wife, found himself cornered by financial troubles. A heated argument with his stepmother on her final afternoon alive revealed tensions that escalated to a breaking point. The day before her death, the prisoner purchased a deadly poison, with intentions to shift blame onto an unsuspecting man, Mrs. Raikes.",1
"""I hereby grant you permission to take possession of those documents and utilize them as you see fit. Farewell, gentlemen,"" Desjardeaux nodded slightly, while Crowther enthusiastically shook Poirot's hand. ""Your words have persuaded me, M. Poirot. Despite its fantastical nature, I wholeheartedly believe in the veracity of your revelations."" Ingles departed alongside us. ""The outcome of the meeting does not disappoint me,"" Poirot remarked during our stroll. ""I did not anticipate winning over Desjardeaux, but I have ensured that my knowledge will not perish with me. And I have gained a few followers.""",1
"""Ah, I've found it."" He stood up and made his way to a beautifully crafted lacquer cabinet, a truly exquisite piece, even to my untrained eye. Upon his return, he held a letter in his hand. ""Here you go. A note from an old sailor I encountered in Shanghai. Probably a drunken old man by now, I presume. I initially dismissed it as the ramblings of a drunkard."" Reading it aloud, he recited, ""DEAR SIR, You may not recall me, but you once helped me in Shanghai. Please help me again. I desperately need money to leave the country.""",1
"Julius stood in front of the safe in the apartment, a moment of hesitation before he finally answered, ""Nothing."" But was it really nothing? Perhaps he had uncovered something he didn't want to share. Tuppence decided to play along, responding casually, ""Nothing in particular."" She sensed Julius casting a quick glance in her direction. ""How about a ride in the park?"" he suggested. ""Sure, why not,"" she agreed. As they strolled beneath the trees, a sense of excitement tingled in the air, bringing a fresh energy to Tuppence.",1
"""So, what do we know about Rayburn? He's got a scar, sure, but that could easily be a fake. He fits the height and build profile though. Can you remember the details of the head you described to the police at Scotland Yard?"" My heart raced. Suzanne was intelligent and well-educated, but I hoped she wasn't familiar with the technical jargon of anthropology. ""Dolichocephalic,"" I replied casually. Suzanne seemed uncertain. ""Are you sure?"" ""Absolutely. It means long-headed, with a width less than 75 percent of its length,"" I explained smoothly. There was a moment of silence.",1
"""At that moment, the front door opened and M. Hautet and the commissary descended the steps. ""Ah, M. Poirot, we were just about to search for you,"" the magistrate stated. ""Although it is late, I feel compelled to visit Madame Daubreuil. Surely, she will be greatly distressed by M. Renauld's passing, and perhaps we can find a lead from her. The secret he kept from his wife may have been shared with the woman who captivated him. We are aware of our Samsons' vulnerabilities, aren't we?"" I found M. Hautet's choice of words quite striking.""",1
"We were there the next morning for Jack Renauld's examination. He looked drastically different, with sunken cheeks and dark circles under his eyes. He refused to acknowledge being in Merlinville on the night of the crime, insisting he was in Cherbourg instead. The witnesses identified him from the train, and he recognized the dagger found at the crime scene as his own design. Despite the mounting evidence against him, Jack maintained his innocence, stating he did not kill his father. Suddenly, a lady entered the room and confessed to the murder, revealing the truth behind the tangled web of lies and deceit.",1
"""As I entered the old abandoned warehouse, memories flooded back from my time in Soho. The fear of the unknown gripped me as I scanned the room, but a wave of relief washed over me when I spotted my coat draped over a chair. The magazine, still tucked in the pocket, was a small comfort. However, the nagging feeling of being watched persisted. Despite my thorough search, I couldn't shake the suspicion of hidden eyes. Overwhelmed, I sank onto a nearby table, whispering 'Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!' into my hands. The slightest sound could send shivers down my spine.""",1
"“Where is your assistant now?” “He’s out sick with a stomach issue,” I replied. “Are you certain it’s just a stomach issue?” “Absolutely. He gets them often.” My guest smirked. “It might be more than a stomach issue. Only time will tell. But let me assure you, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray wouldn’t be shocked if there was an attempt to remove your assistant. Don’t worry about yourself” I must have shown a hint of concern “you’re not in danger. With your assistant gone, it would be easier to reach you. Either way, Mr. Milray wants me to go with you.",1
"""Surely, he's nearby!"" She gazed at Sir James, who responded seriously: ""Respecting your hunch, Miss Tuppence (and mine too), I fail to see how anyone could be here undetected."" The young woman felt a bit reassured by his remarks. ""Staying awake at night always gives me the creeps,"" she admitted. ""Agreed,"" Sir James agreed. ""It's like we're conducting a séance. Maybe with a psychic here, we'd witness something extraordinary."" ""Are you a believer in spiritualism?"" Tuppence inquired, her eyes widening.",1
"""Inglethorp’s voice you heard?” “Oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?” “Well, what happened next?” “Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o’clock, Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea nothing to eat to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful so white and upset. ‘Dorcas,’ she says, ‘I’ve had a great shock.’ ‘I’m sorry for that, m’m,’ I says. ‘You’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea, m’m.’ She had something in her hand.""",1
"""But at what point did their 'strategy' falter?"" ""My friend, the idea of posing as a maid or butler is sound, but one must not neglect their duties. They overlooked a room in need of dusting; hence, when the man placed the jewel-case on the small table by the connecting door, it left a distinct mark."" ""I recall that moment,"" I exclaimed. ""Everything became clear."" A brief pause followed. ""And I have my pearls,"" Mrs. Opalsen added, like a chorus in a play. ""Well then,"" I remarked, ""it's time for dinner."" Poirot walked beside me. ""This success should boost your reputation,"" I commented.",1
"""The cabin must have held some secrets,"" I suggested. ""That would make sense of why my belongings were thrown about the following day. Yet, I scoured every inch and found nothing hidden."" ""Do you think the young man could have planted something in a drawer while you were distracted?"" Suzanne proposed. I dismissed the idea. ""I would have noticed."" ""Perhaps they were after your important document?"" she pondered. ""It's possible, but it had already served its purpose. The time and date had come and gone."" Suzanne concurred, ""True, of course.""",1
"""That wasn’t the usual way. Listen.” So I recounted the incident of the cocoa sample that Poirot had sent for analysis. John cut in just like I did. “But wait, Bauerstein had already analyzed it, right?” “Exactly, that’s the key. It didn’t click for me until now. Do you see? Bauerstein had it analyzed, that’s the trick! If Bauerstein is the killer, it would be easy for him to swap his sample with regular cocoa, and have that tested. Naturally, they wouldn’t detect any strychnine! But no one would suspect Bauerstein, or consider getting another sample except Poirot,” I realized, a bit late.",1
"“Then I shan’t drink it,” declared Tuppence. “I’d much rather be shot. At least that would cause a commotion, and someone might overhear. But I refuse to be eliminated quietly like a lamb.” Mrs. Vandemeyer was furious. “Don’t be absurd! Do you truly believe I desire a murder investigation trailing after me? If you possess any intelligence, you’ll understand that poisoning you wouldn’t align with my plans. It’s just a sleeping potion, nothing more. You’ll awaken tomorrow unharmed. I simply can’t be bothered with tying you up and silencing you.”",1
"Bella's unexpected visit threw off his plans. He quickly got rid of her to proceed with his dark deeds. Binding and silencing Madame Renauld, he corrected past mistakes, leaving subtle clues behind. Disguised in an overcoat, he carried out the sinister act under the cover of darkness. The meticulous arrangement of the crime scene pointed directly at him. The final twist of fate came when he met his own demise. Despite the complex web of lies, Poirot unraveled the truth behind the elaborate scheme. The clever manipulation of evidence by the real culprits posed a challenge, but Poirot's keen insight prevailed. The intricate dance of deception and betrayal left a trail of devastation in its wake.",1
"On my instructions, Mrs. Renauld rejected her son and announced her plan to draft a will the following day that would prevent him from inheriting any of his father's wealth. It was a drastic measure, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was willing to take the chance, although she neglected to mention her change of location. I assumed she assumed I was aware. Everything unfolded as predicted. Marthe Daubreuil attempted one final effort to claim the Renauld fortune and was unsuccessful! ""What truly astounds me,"" I remarked, ""is how she managed to enter the premises without detection. It's truly miraculous.",1
"Mrs. Davenheim is described as a pleasant but not very bright woman, and it is mentioned that Mr. Davenheim had many financial rivals who may bear ill will towards him. A gardener saw a figure near the rose-garden, and there is speculation about suicide or foul play. Poirot examines a photograph of the missing man and finds the case to be quite obscure. Japp later reveals that Mr. Davenheim's clothes were found near the lake, and Lowen, a suspect, was seen near the study around the time of the disappearance. A pawned ring belonging to Mr. Davenheim further complicates the case. The narrative ends with the introduction of Billy Kellett, who provides a strange account of his activities on the day of the disappearance.",1
"""It's quite the revelation, isn't it, his intention to step down? To step down! Just like a surgeon, or a tailor, or a mechanic,"" Nadina remarked. ""It's to be expected. The 'Colonel' has long been a skilled businessman. He's structured crime much like one would structure a textile mill. Without getting his hands dirty, he has orchestrated and overseen a string of remarkable achievements, covering all aspects of what one might refer to as his 'trade.'""",1
"""But Tommy harbored a different and improbable aspiration. He was convinced, whether justly or not, that if Mr. Brown was exposed and apprehended, the entire operation would collapse disgracefully and immediately. The mysterious controlling power of the anonymous leader kept everything intact. In Tommy's opinion, without him, a sudden hysteria would take over; and, with the honorable individuals free to act independently, a last-minute resolution could be within reach. “This is a one-person production,” Tommy mused to himself. “The key is to apprehend the individual.” It was partially to advance this grand plan that he had instructed Mr. Carter to refrain from unveiling the sealed package.""",1
"""Please, Renauld,"" said M. Hautet, gesturing towards a chair. ""My heart goes out to you. The news must have come as a dreadful shock. But it's a stroke of luck that you were unable to set sail. Hopefully, you can provide us with the answers we seek to unravel this enigma."" Renauld nodded. ""I am here to help, M. le juge. Feel free to ask me anything."" ""Let's start with this - was this journey undertaken at your father's behest?"" ""Indeed, M. le juge. I received a telegram instructing me to travel urgently to Buenos Ayres, then through the Andes to Valparaiso and finally to Santiago.""",1
"Had my obsession with the smell of moth balls gone too far? I thought I was imagining things when I detected the familiar scent on the roll of films as well. Holding them up to my nose only confirmed my suspicions. There was definitely a strong smell of moth balls lingering on them. But upon closer inspection, I discovered a tiny piece of cloth stuck on a rough edge of the film reel, saturated with the unpleasant odor. It became clear that the films had once been in the overcoat pocket of the man who met his end in the Tube. But how did they end up here? It couldn't have been him - his every move had been traced and documented.",1
"Poirot's eyes flashed with malice. ""No need to trouble yourself for information. The Dulcibella Sisters have terminated their contract and disappeared from Coventry,"" he stated confidently. ""Are you certain, Poirot?"" I inquired. ""Absolutely, Hastings. I verified it this morning. What else did you anticipate?"" Indeed, there was nothing else to expect. Cinderella had taken advantage of the head start I provided and would waste no time in evading capture. My intentions had been fulfilled.",1
"My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I am compelled to reach out to you, not solely for the joy of writing, but for the certain delight it will bring you to receive my message. Our mutual acquaintance Race's intellect may not be as sharp as he believes. I am considering naming you as the executor of my literary works. Enclosed is my personal journal. While it holds no appeal for Race and his associates, I believe you may find some passages entertaining. Feel free to utilize it as you wish. Perhaps a piece for the Daily Budget titled ""Encounters with Criminals."" I do insist, however, that I remain the focal point.",1
"""Guy Pagett grimaced, ""This will certainly impact the constituency,"" he commented sadly. I can't understand why, but I trust Pagett's judgment in these situations. Logically, a Member of Parliament's abilities shouldn't diminish just because a young woman is found murdered in his vacant property. However, public perception is unpredictable. ""She's also a foreigner, which complicates things,"" Pagett added gloomily. Once again, I have to agree with him.""",1
"“After receiving the devastating news from his friend, the nephew tragically took his own life. Despite Mr. Bleibner's lack of a will, his fortune would ultimately be inherited by his nephew and then passed on to the doctor.” “As for Mr. Schneider, his involvement remains uncertain. Considering his acquaintance with young Bleibner, he may have had suspicions. Alternatively, the doctor could have orchestrated another death to further fuel superstitious beliefs. Additionally, I must share an intriguing psychological insight, Hastings. A murderer often feels compelled to reenact their crime, becoming increasingly consumed by the act itself.",1
"Mrs. Cavendish, who had wed John's father after he became a widower with two sons, had been a striking woman in her middle years from my memory. There was no way she could be younger than seventy at present. I remembered her as a dynamic and domineering individual, with a penchant for philanthropic and social endeavors, enjoying organizing charity events and taking on the role of a benefactor. She was known for her generosity and substantial personal wealth. Mr. Cavendish had bought their estate, Styles Court, soon after their marriage.",1
"""She feigned great interest in our discovery, and we shared all the details with her, even revealing the diamonds. Delilah, a fitting name for her deceptive ways, played her role convincingly! The De Beers heist was uncovered, and suddenly the police swooped in. They confiscated our diamonds. Initially, we found the situation laughable. However, when the diamonds were presented in court, there was no doubt - they were the stolen De Beers gems. Anita Grünberg had vanished, successfully executing the switch. Our claim that these were not the original stones fell on deaf ears, met with ridicule.""",1
"Daniels had been under surveillance for weeks. The evidence against him was piling up: the mysterious phone calls, the unexplained absences from work, the large sums of money appearing in his bank account. But there was one piece of the puzzle that didn't quite fit. Daniels had always been a loyal employee, never causing any trouble or raising any suspicions. Could it be possible that he was involved in something much darker than anyone had ever imagined?",1
"There, using an alias, he gets married and eventually amasses a large fortune in South America. Despite his success, he feels a longing for his homeland after two decades. He has changed significantly in looks and stature, making it unlikely for anyone to link him to a criminal from the past. Feeling confident in his safety, he decides to come back. Settling in England with plans to summer in France, he unknowingly ends up in Merlinville, where fate catches up to him.",1
"“Poirot, we need your help urgently,” Lord Estair said, his face grave. “The Prime Minister has disappeared, kidnapped on his way to France for an important conference. We must act quickly.” Poirot's brow furrowed as he listened to the details of the case. The Prime Minister's car had been ambushed, shots fired, and the driver, O’Murphy, had taken a detour off the main road, only to disappear later. The Secretary, Daniels, was found bound and gagged, but alive. There were too many unanswered questions, too many variables to consider. Poirot pondered over the situation, weighing the facts carefully. “This is a dark and complex case,” he muttered to himself. “We must proceed with caution and method.”",1
"""It's strange, don't you think? Could it be haunted?"" ""Haunted flat? Never heard of such a thing,"" Parker stated firmly. ""No,"" Mrs. Robinson seemed skeptical. ""But there were some odd things that caught my attention."" ""Like what?"" I inquired. ""Ah,"" Parker chimed in, ""our expert in crime is intrigued! Share your thoughts with him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is skilled at unraveling mysteries."" I chuckled, feeling awkward yet slightly flattered by the role assigned to me.",1
"""The young man stood outside Leastways Cottage, hesitating briefly before knocking on the door. Poirot's voice called out from inside, instructing him to wait a moment. Poirot gestured for me to join him as he hurried down the stairs to answer the door. Mr. Mace wasted no time, immediately expressing his apologies for the interruption and inquiring about Poirot's recent return from the Hall. The young man, visibly nervous, mentioned the rumors circulating in the village regarding the sudden death of old Mrs. Inglethorp, hinting at the possibility of poison. Poirot's expression remained unreadable.""",1
"""At the stroke of three, we found ourselves back at Charing Cross station. Despite our protests, Poirot remained steadfast, insisting that starting at square one was not a futile endeavor, but rather the only logical course of action. During our journey, he had a hushed conversation with Norman, who promptly sent off a flurry of telegrams from Dover. Thanks to Norman's connections, we breezed through each checkpoint with unprecedented speed. Upon our arrival in London, a sleek police vehicle awaited us, accompanied by plain-clothed officers. One of them passed a typed document to Poirot, silently answering my unspoken question.""",1
"The statements, though absurd and baseless, were fervently believed by many. Despite this, the prosecution remained relentless in their pursuit of justice. They refuted the existence of the mysterious ""Russians"" and instead accused Madame Beroldy and her accomplice, Georges Conneau, of the crime. While a warrant was issued for Conneau's arrest, he had cunningly vanished. It was revealed that the restraints holding Madame Beroldy were in fact loose enough for her to escape at any moment.",1
"With a sigh she sat up, her eyes still wild and frightened. “It’s all right. Don’t be afraid, my child. You’re quite safe.” Her breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to her cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically. “So you’re not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy of yours was!” “The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,” boasted Tuppence. “So it seems,” said Sir James dryly. “Am I right in thinking that the joint venture has ended in success, and that this” he turned to the girl on the couch “is Miss Jane Finn?” Jane sat up.",1
"A second diamond, identical in shape and size, served as the right eye. Legend had it that this gem too would eventually be taken. 'One eye will head West, the other East, until they reunite. Then, they will come back to the deity in glory.' It's interesting to note that there exists currently a gem closely resembling this one, referred to as 'the Star of the West' or 'the Western Star.' This precious stone belongs to the renowned movie star, Mary Marvell. A side-by-side analysis of these two jewels would be fascinating."" She fell silent.",1
"The passage was dark and eerie, with only a faint light illuminating the room. Mrs. Maltravers let out a blood-curdling scream as she turned to Poirot. ""You saw him there in the passage?"" she cried out, her voice filled with terror. Poirot looked puzzled, shaking his head. ""Madame, I saw nothing. You must be imagining things."" But Mrs. Maltravers insisted, her voice growing more frantic. Suddenly, the lights flickered and went out, plunging the room into darkness. Three loud raps echoed through the room, causing Mrs. Maltravers to moan in fear. And then, as if materializing out of thin air, the figure of a man appeared before them, glowing with an unearthly light.",1
"“Miss Beddingfeld, I was indeed there,” Pagett confessed. “I had my own reasons for being in the neighborhood.” “Sir Eustace hasn’t already told you?” “I believe he may have known for years,” Pagett continued. “He seems to take pleasure in keeping me in suspense.”As the whistle blew and passengers returned to the train, Miss Beddingfeld pressed for answers. “Why did you go to Marlow?” Pagett hesitated, then reluctantly shared his secret. Walking back to the hotel, Miss Beddingfeld received a wire with instructions to go to Johannesburg, signed by Harry. Deep in thought, she couldn’t shake off the mystery surrounding Pagett's behavior.",1
"In the dead of night, the thief made a swift escape under the cover of darkness. Lord Yardly promptly dispatched a footman to summon the police, while Lady Yardly, aided by Poirot, recounted her harrowing ordeal. ""I was about to switch on the lamp,"" she recounted shakily, ""when a man pounced on me from behind. He ripped my necklace off with such violence that I tumbled to the ground. In that moment, I caught a glimpse of him vanishing through the side entrance.""",1
"""Some people leave, others arrive - two completely different scenarios, Hastings. However, if you assume incorrectly, soon enough discrepancies will appear, leading you astray."" ""What is the significance of all this, Poirot?"" Poirot suddenly jumped up, full of vigor. ""It means I have been a complete fool. Hurry, to the apartment in Westminster. There may still be time."" We rushed off in a cab. Poirot remained silent, ignoring my frantic inquiries. We ascended the stairs quickly. Despite our repeated attempts, there was no response at the door, yet upon listening closely, I could hear a faint groan emanating from inside.""",1
"""His name is John Eardsley,"" Colonel Race announced abruptly before walking away. I watched him leave, feeling a mix of emotions. Harry's voice broke through my thoughts, pleading for forgiveness. As he reached out to hold my hand, I instinctively pulled away. ""Why did you lie to me?"" I asked, my voice tinged with hurt. ""I was scared that you would only care about the wealth and power that came with me. I wanted you to love me for who I am, stripped of all the superficialities.""",1
"""During a fleeting moment, Giraud's visage was veiled by an intense, almost murderous fury. Advancing two paces towards his antagonist, he was abruptly interrupted as Marchaud swung open the salon door and inquired, ""M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?"" The newcomer who crossed the threshold exuded a commanding presence. Towering in height, with a sturdy athletic build, and a deeply tanned complexion, he effortlessly captivated the room. Even Giraud appeared pallid in comparison. It wasn't long before I discerned that Gabriel Stonor possessed a truly remarkable persona.""",1
"The Daily Budget was desperate for a big story. My hunch was right and it turned out to be the scoop of a lifetime. ""Mill House Murder victim identified by our exclusive reporter."" And that's not all. ""Our reporter travels with the killer. Unveiling 'The Man in the Brown Suit.'"" The details were sent to South African papers, but I didn't revisit my own detailed reports until much later. Finally, I got the green light and detailed instructions via cable in Bulawayo.",1

Lastly, we have Madame Renauld and her son, Mr. Jack Renauld. Unfortunately, Mr. Jack Renauld is also out of town.” Poirot nodded in acknowledgment. M.""",1
"As I looked around, a sense of malevolence hung in the air. The chilling possibility crossed my mind - could I be the next target? Poirot whispered softly, ""Mon Dieu, this is beyond comprehension. It's terrifying. Please, sir, was it definitely tetanus?"" ""I don't think so. Dr. Ames will have more information,"" I replied. ""Ah, you're not the physician then."" ""No, I'm Tosswill."" Lady Willard's British specialist, a man named Tosswill from the British Museum, emitted an aura of seriousness and determination that intrigued me. ""Follow me,"" Dr. Ames urged.",1
"Part of me was horrified by the sudden tragedy, while another part of me observed with detached interest the efforts to rescue the man from the electrified rail. ""Excuse me, please. I am a doctor."" A tall man with a brown beard pushed his way through and knelt beside the lifeless body. A strange feeling of surrealism washed over me as I watched. It felt almost unreal. After a moment, the doctor stood up and grimly declared, ""He's gone. There's nothing more to do."" We all gathered closer, and a distressed porter spoke up.",1
"""He discovered some spare change in his pants pocket."" ""But no wallet."" ""Some individuals do not carry a wallet or purse of any sort."" I attempted a different approach. ""You do not find it strange that the physician never appeared afterwards?"" ""A busy doctor often does not keep up with the news. He likely forgot all about the incident."" ""In truth, detective, you seem intent on finding nothing unusual,"" I remarked politely. ""Well, I believe you use the term a bit too frequently, Miss Beddingfeld. Young women tend to be idealistic, I understand, fascinated by enigmas and similar matters. However, as I am pressed for time"" I took the cue and stood up.",1
"“What reason would he have to do that? Especially with criminals and killers roaming the streets every minute! Ridiculous! The man was not foolish. It’s not like he had to release that woman.” The judge interjected abruptly: “That woman? Which lady are you referring to?” “Why, the woman who visited him.” “A woman had visited him that night?” “Of course, sir, and on many other nights too.” “Who was she? Were you acquainted with her?” A sly expression crossed the woman’s face. “How would I know who she was?” she grumbled. “I didn’t let her in last evening.",1
"We were isolated from society, resembling Adam and Eve in solitude but with stark contrasts! Old Batani loitered nearby, observing like a curious dog. I took charge of cooking, despite the challenge with only one functional arm. Harry often roamed outside, while we passed hours together lounging in the palm tree shade, conversing, arguing, touching on all topics imaginable, fighting and reconciling. Our arguments were frequent, yet a genuine and enduring camaraderie developed, beyond what I thought feasible. That, and an unspoken connection.",1
"""Could it have been one of the hotel staff?""  ""Just a waiter holding a tray, sir."" ""Aha!"" Poirot exclaimed, his tone revealing volumes.  ""That explains why he had his coat buttoned up to his neck,"" Poirot pondered, after we had managed to dismiss the agitated hotel staff.  ""I apologize, Poirot,"" I sighed, feeling dejected. ""I thought I had defeated him.""  ""Yes, that was a clever Japanese tactic, I believe. Don't worry, my friend. Everything went as planned - his plan. That's what I intended.""  ""What's this?""

I brought the items as requested, and she asked me to wait while she searched for something. Then, she glanced at the clock and urged, ‘Hurry up,’ she said.""",1
"He meticulously constructs his argument, like a sculptor chiseling away at stone, with painstaking dedication. However, the details he focuses on may not align with my own intentions; he might overlook the significance of the very clues I am after. Let us commence."" Poirot systematically and precisely sifted through each compartment, inspecting the items within before carefully replacing them. It was a tedious and uneventful process. Poirot sifted through shirts, trousers, and shoes. A faint hum from outside caught my attention. Suddenly, I was filled with a sense of urgency. ""Poirot!"" I exclaimed. ""A vehicle has just arrived. Giraud has arrived with Jack Renauld and two policemen.""",1
"""Despite the lack of clarity, rest assured that it holds importance."" ""At this moment,"" I pondered, ""even with more information, we are no closer to uncovering the truth behind Mr. Renauld's murder."" ""Correct,"" Poirot said cheerfully.

Previously, there was a solid theory on the circumstances of his death. Now, that has vanished.""",1
"""The opportunity will not arise again, I suspect. However, one crucial meeting must occur to establish my strategy. Without Mr. Brown, my hands are tied. Is he present?” The German's tone shifted noticeably as he responded, hesitating slightly: “We have been informed that he cannot attend in the flesh.” He paused, leaving the sentence hanging. A sly grin spread across the other man's face. Glancing at a group of anxious expressions, he remarked, “I see now. I am familiar with his tactics. He operates covertly and relies on no one.""",1
"At six, my father passed away. Eight years later, my mother joined him in the grave. The only kin left was my Uncle Andrew, who acquired Crabtree Manor after returning from Australia. Despite his kindness, he had firm beliefs in women's education, opposing 'book knowledge.' Our arguments were endless, especially when I won a scholarship to Girton. His will left me a year to prove my wits, challenging me to unravel the mystery of the manor. With Poirot's help, the hunt began, uncovering hidden secrets in the old house.",1

""My uncle received this as a gift a few weeks back, with a request to use it in his next game,"" she explained. Gesturing towards the center of the room, she continued, ""It was placed right there."" Poirot carefully inspected the table, his focus on every detail appeared excessive to me. His line of questioning was unconventional, lacking inquiries on crucial aspects of the case. I suspected that the mention of the Big Four had disoriented him completely.""",1
"I had barely made it to the top of the staircase when he vanished from sight. Mary Cavendish stood at the juncture of the stairs, peering down into the hall where he had disappeared.

"""That was my one fear, the possibility of having to eliminate them before reaching your hidden location, and then potentially searching for you in vain afterwards."" ""Eliminate them?""

Suddenly a thought occurred to him. “A very good speech, Conrad,” he said approvingly. “But wherefore the bonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat without delay?” “Garn,” said Number 14 unexpectedly.",1
"""Captain Hastings, we decided to visit Stosser and Paul, despite their reputation for expensive Mayfair flats. They offered us properties for four or five hundred a year, or with huge premiums.

The clerk complained about people not confirming if they were interested, leading to wasted viewings. It was a frustrating situation for all involved.""",1
"""Poor chap is still recovering."" ""Severe bronchitis can really knock a man down,"" Mr. Shaw admitted sadly. ""But I fear Mr. Vavasour may have been overwhelmed by my absence, especially with this unexpected problem arising."" Poirot probed further with his questions, trying to assess the relationship between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour's responses were short and formal. His nephew, a reliable bank employee, had no financial troubles or debts that he was aware of. He had handled similar tasks before.",1
"""They’re just acquaintances, really, even Suzanne. The person who penned that note must have possessed a vast amount of insider information. It certainly wasn't the work of an outsider,"" I calmly mentioned the note this time, without a trace of embarrassment. ""If you were to follow my advice,"" he began, pausing. ""I doubt that I will,"" I responded honestly. ""But I'm willing to listen."" ""Do you always follow your own desires, Miss Beddingfeld?"" ""Typically,"" I cautiously replied. With anyone else, I would have said ""Always."" ""I feel sorry for your husband,"" he unexpectedly remarked. ""There's no need for that,"" I shot back.",1
"I could only imagine what Miss Pettigrew must have been thinking. For her to assume that I had the habit of summoning Anne Beddingfeld out of thin air at midnight was beyond absurd. Such a notion could be damaging to a man of my standing. ""I assume,"" I remarked icily, ""that she is in her own bed at this hour."" I cleared my throat and directed a pointed look at Miss Pettigrew, indicating my readiness to continue dictating. Hopefully, Mrs. Blair would pick up on the hint. Unfortunately, she did not. Instead, she collapsed into a nearby chair and anxiously gestured with her slippered foot. ""She's not in her room. I've checked.""",1
"""Will he manage to confront the girl he sought after? “I won’t directly request any information from her,” he murmured calmly. “At least not explicitly.” “So why bother meeting her?” Tommy hesitated. “To observe her reaction when I pose a single question,” he eventually responded. Once again, there was a cryptic look in the German’s eyes that Tommy couldn’t quite decipher. “She won’t be able to respond to your inquiry.” “It doesn’t matter. I’ll have witnessed her expression when I ask it.” “And you believe that will reveal something to you?” He emitted a brief, unpleasant chuckle.""",1
"""The faith I have in Tuppence is unwavering,"" Tommy declared confidently. The journey proved to be long and tiresome, with frequent stops and cramped train cars. They were required to change trains on two occasions, first at Doncaster, then at a small junction. Upon arriving at the deserted Ebury station, they sought guidance from a lone porter. ""Could you perhaps point us in the direction of the Moat House?"" Tommy inquired. The porter responded, ""The Moat House? Quite a distance from here. Are you referring to the grand residence by the seaside?"" Tommy nodded affirmatively. Following the porter's intricate yet confusing instructions, they made their way out of the station.",1
"""Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M.

"He sported gold-rimmed spectacles, his expression oddly detached. His voice, deep and smooth, had a theatrical quality. When he shook my hand, it felt like wood. ""A pleasure, Mr. Hastings,"" he said. Then, to his wife: ""Emily, darling, this cushion feels damp."" She gazed at him adoringly as he swapped it out with great tenderness. What a bizarre infatuation for such a sensible woman! In the room with Mr. Inglethorp, a tense atmosphere of hidden animosity descended over the group.",1
"""He’d arranged the stones on the path to create an illusion, luring unsuspecting victims into danger. If I get my hands on him, he'll regret it!"" After a pause, his tone shifted: ""We've avoided discussing these matters, Anne. It's time. You need to hear the whole truth from the very beginning."" ""If revisiting the past is painful for you, please don't feel obligated,"" I whispered softly. ""But I need you to understand. I never imagined I'd reveal that part of my past to anyone. Fate has a strange way of testing us, doesn't it?"" There was a moment of silence before he spoke again.",1
"I couldn't shake the feeling that I should remember something, like it was on the tip of my tongue, but slipped away every time I reached for it. Then she claimed I was her niece and insisted on being called ‘Aunt Rita.’ I complied, and she reassured me that my memory would return soon. “It was a dreadful night. I had devised a plan while I waited for her. The documents were secure for now, but I couldn't risk keeping them there any longer. They might discard that magazine at any moment. I stayed up, watching the clock until I estimated it was around two in the morning.",1
"The night of the Fancy Dress ball was a turning point for me. I pondered over whom to confide in, feeling a sudden loneliness and vulnerability. Colonel Race seemed kind and intelligent, but too commanding for my liking. Mrs. Blair, on the other hand, was approachable and experienced in life's ways. I made up my mind to seek her out immediately. After learning her cabin number, I headed to Mrs. Blair's cabin, where she welcomed me in her stunning kimono. I opened up to her about my life story, expecting a certain reaction but receiving a surprising response.",1
"As we journeyed through the vast and ever-changing landscapes, there was always something fascinating to behold. From the breathtaking beauty of the Hex river valley to the haunting desolation of the Karoo, and finally the endless straight path in Bechuanaland. At each stop, which barely resembled a station, a swarm of natives emerged from the barren surroundings, offering their handmade treasures. Suzanne was captivated, quickly starting a collection of the intricately carved wooden animals they presented.",1
"""Eventually the cab fare was settled, the woman handing over a humble twopence, and the driver, still clutching the various coins, was convinced to depart, albeit with a final gruff inquiry about the amount given. “You've probably overpaid him, Tommy,” Tuppence remarked innocently. “I think he's probably trying to return some of it.” Perhaps it was this comment that convinced the driver to leave. “So,” Mr. Beresford exclaimed, finally able to express his frustration, “why did you insist on taking a taxi?” “I was worried I might be late and make you wait,” Tuppence replied softly.""",1
"We conducted a thorough assessment of the situation during our initial evening together. Our conversation lasted for hours. It was evident to me that a combination of defensive and aggressive strategies would be essential. I felt secure traveling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his group. With both him and Colonel Race by my side, I knew I had strong protection. I assumed my adversaries would be reluctant to provoke a confrontation. Furthermore, being close to Sir Eustace meant I was also connected to Guy Pagett, who was at the center of the enigma. I questioned Suzanne about the possibility of Pagett himself being the elusive “Colonel.""",1
"With an air of nonchalance, I approached the lady who appeared to be in charge of the ship. Her fair hair and blue eyes gave her an air of elegance, and her Parisian clothes spoke of sophistication. As she commanded the deck stewards to rearrange her chair multiple times, I couldn't help but be intrigued by her confidence and charm. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted and how to get it, a rare quality indeed. Perhaps, once I regained my strength, I would strike up a conversation with her, if only to learn her secret to navigating the world with such finesse.",1
"""But who could have done it?"" I asked, looking around the room for any clues. Poirot remained silent, a thoughtful look on his face. It was clear that he was deep in contemplation, trying to piece together the puzzle that lay before us. Suddenly, he spoke up. ""It must be someone close to the victim,"" he said, his eyes narrowing. I nodded, realizing the gravity of the situation. We were dealing with a cunning criminal, one who had managed to cover their tracks with precision. As we delved deeper into the case, I couldn't shake the feeling that the answer was right in front of us, waiting to be uncovered. The truth was out there, lurking in the shadows, and it was up to us to bring it to light.",1
"""Who is Count Stepanov?"" she inquired, feigning innocence. ""A Russian visitor, I believe,"" came the reply. ""Does he come around often?"" she probed further. ""Occasionally. Why do you ask?"" ""Just curious if he has eyes for the lady of the house,"" she said, trying to sound nonchalant. ""Always prying, aren't you?"" the response came with a hint of annoyance. As they continued their conversation, Tuppence couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story. ""Time to serve the soufflé,"" the other person announced, breaking the moment. Tuppence made a mental note to pay closer attention to the discussions happening around her.",1
"The accused's relations were purely platonic, which only fueled suspicions against her. Unable to become his mistress due to the man's upstanding character, Jeanne Beroldy plotted to rid herself of her husband and marry the wealthy American. Madame Beroldy remained composed and confident in the face of her interrogators. She maintained her story, insisting she was of noble lineage and a victim of a childhood switch with a fruit seller's daughter.",1
"""That’s no ordinary match, not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Fortunately, it remains unlit. Otherwise, I wouldn't have recognized it. Clearly, one of the men tossed away his cigarette end, and lit another, dropping one match out of the box in the process.” “And the other match?” inquired Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he used to light his cigarette. Have you found that as well?” “No.” “Maybe you didn’t search thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly.” The detective appeared on the verge of losing his temper, but managed to keep his composure. “I see you enjoy a good joke, M. Poirot.”",1
"He couldn't afford to waste a moment trying to locate Tuppence. Chances were she was still lingering around South Audley Mansions. However, he had another potential ally. He dialed the Ritz and requested to speak with Julius Hersheimmer. After a click and a buzz, he hoped the young American would be in his room. Another click, and then a distinct ""Hello"" sounded over the line. ""Is that you, Hersheimmer? Beresford here. I'm at Waterloo. I've tailed Whittington and another individual here. No time for details. Whittington's heading to Bournemouth on the 3.30 train. Can you make it there in time?"" The response was affirmative. ""Absolutely. I'll hurry.""",1
"""But let us move on from the enigma of the Yellow Jasmine to the Enigma of the Spices,"" Poirot declared. ""Who tampered with it? Why? There are numerous inquiries to be made. Ah Ling, naturally, was responsible for the dish. But what motive could he have to harm his employer? Could he be affiliated with a secret society, perhaps a tong? Such organizations are not unheard of. Maybe the tong of the Spiced Curry. Then, of course, there is the matter of Gerald Paynter."" I paused suddenly. ""Indeed,"" Poirot acknowledged with a solemn nod. ""Gerald Paynter is a significant figure, as you rightly pointed out. He stands to inherit his uncle's fortune. However, he was not present at the dinner that evening.""",1
"""In fact, a friend from the City tipped me off about a lucrative opportunity. With money to spare, I suggested a weekend getaway at the Grand Metropolitan would be just the ticket for us all."" ""Thank you, I graciously accept. Your kindness towards an old man is truly heartwarming. In the grand scheme of things, it's the kindness that truly matters. Sometimes, I forget that,"" I hesitated at the insinuation. Poirot seems to underestimate my intellect at times.""",1
"""And the concept is intriguing, indeed. Identity remains a mystery. We observe, uncertain of Mr. Brown's true role. Leading yet following, blending in our midst. His true nature concealed from all."" The Russian dismissed his whimsical thoughts, checking the time. ""Shall we depart?"" Whittington suggested. After settling the bill with the waitress, they made their way downstairs. Hailing a taxi, Whittington instructed the driver to head towards Waterloo.",1
"""His presence is both repulsive and intriguing; an aura of fear always surrounds him,"" she whispered. ""He was overseas during the Kimberley heist,"" Harry revealed thoughtfully. ""It was him who divulged the 'Colonel's' secrets to Suzanne, detailing his escapades in Paris."" ""A masterful deception,"" she mused. ""But where does Pagett fit into this puzzle? Is he a pawn of Race?"" ""Possibly,"" Harry pondered, ""or perhaps Pagett is playing a game of his own."" ""What?"" ""Recall, Anne. Have you ever heard Pagett's version of the events at Kilmorden?"" ""Only through Sir Eustace,"" she replied, recounting the tale. Harry absorbed every word with keen interest.",1
"To successfully impersonate either of them in broad daylight requires a genius actor and a resemblance in facial features. However, Alfred Inglethorp's appearance is completely altered by his clothing, beard, and glasses that obscure his eyes. The key instinct of a criminal is to shift suspicion away from themselves, and the best way to do that is to blame someone else. In this case, there was a convenient scapegoat readily available. Everyone was already inclined to suspect Mr. Inglethorp's guilt.",1
"""He attempted to flee, but I was one step ahead. He's now in custody for the killing of his father, M. Paul Renauld."" Poirot turned sharply towards the young man, who was slouched against the wall, his complexion drained of color. ""Any words, jeune homme?"" Jack Renauld gazed back at him expressionless. ""None,"" he replied. I was taken aback. Until that moment, I couldn't accept Jack Renauld's guilt. I anticipated a vehement denial of the accusations when Poirot confronted him.",1
"""Why did you take the dagger?” I inquired curiously. She responded with the innocence of a child: “I was worried about fingerprints being left on it.” “But didn’t you wear gloves?” She shook her head in confusion, then whispered hesitantly: “Are you planning to turn me over to the authorities?” “Never in a million years.” Her gaze met mine, filled with uncertainty, and she timidly asked: “Why?” It was an unexpected moment for a confession of affection, and I had never envisioned love finding its way to me in such circumstances. Yet, I replied sincerely and without hesitation: “Because, my dear Cinderella, I love you.”",1
"As I pondered the situation, an idea began to form in my mind. Poirot must not uncover my secret, I thought. Although I struggled to fully understand the meaning behind it, I was confident that Lawrence's response, coupled with my adept questioning, would reveal the truth. With determination, I approached him. ""I've been searching for you,"" I lied. ""Have you?"" he replied. ""Yes, actually. The reality is, Poirot has a message for you."" ""Oh?"" Lawrence's interest was piqued. ""He instructed me to relay it when we were alone,"" I whispered, fixing my gaze on him slyly.",1
"The trial brought out the truth through extensive cross-examinations, a process that proved to be lengthy and tiresome. Following Evelyn Howard's abrupt exit, I was informed of her new position as a nurse at the prominent Middlingham hospital, located fifteen miles from our town. She pleaded with me to inform her if Mrs. Inglethorp expressed any desire for reconciliation. Amidst the tranquility, the unsettling factor was Mrs. Cavendish's inexplicable fondness for Dr. Bauerstein's company.",1
"""There is no doubt in my mind that they will retaliate,"" I declared. ""First, they attempted to force me out of England, which was unsuccessful. Then, during the Dartmoor incident, we intervened to rescue their target from execution. And just yesterday, we once again thwarted their schemes. It is clear that they will not rest until they have their revenge."" Lost in thought, a sudden knock interrupted my contemplation. The door swung open before I could respond, revealing a slender man with a distinctive hooked nose and pallid skin tone.",1
"I approached Pagett on the platform, eager to speak with him. He seemed startled by my presence, his usual nervous demeanor even more pronounced this time. ""Miss Beddingfeld, I thought you had vanished,"" he exclaimed. The train had arrived just ten minutes behind schedule, with everyone hastily disembarking and pacing back and forth. The hotel porter had mentioned that the train's journey to Johannesburg was going smoothly today, despite doubts due to a recent explosion along the line. It was a surprisingly cheerful notion, considering the circumstances.",1
"It's quite possible that many individuals around the globe are unaware of the discovery of an ancient skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. One morning, I found Papa in a state of extreme excitement, almost to the point of apoplexy. He proceeded to recount the entire tale to me. ""Do you see, Anne? While there are indeed certain similarities to the Java skull, they are merely superficial. No, what we have here is what I've always argued to be the prototype of the Neanderthal lineage. Do you agree that the Gibraltar skull is the most archaic among the Neanderthal specimens discovered? It all traces back to Africa, the birthplace of the race.""",1
"The vehicle decelerated to a crawl, allowing a sudden figure to clamber over the rear and dive headfirst into their midst. ""Apologies,"" Tommy muttered as he disentangled himself. A cacophony of confused voices surrounded him. He addressed each in turn: ""I was hiding in the bushes near the driveway. Managed to hold on at the back. Couldn't alert you sooner with the speed you were driving. It was a struggle to stay put. Come on now, ladies, time to exit!"" ""Exit?"" ""Indeed. There's a train station just ahead on that road. Train is expected in three minutes. You'll make it if you hurry."" ""What on earth are you getting at?"" Julius demanded.",1
"As they searched for clues, the looming question remained - would these crimes go unsolved? Dorcas approached me after breakfast, a mysterious air about her. ""Can we speak privately, sir?"" she inquired. ""Of course, Dorcas. What's on your mind?"" I replied. ""It's about the Belgian gentleman, sir. Will you be meeting with him today?"" she asked. Upon confirming, Dorcas hesitated before revealing, ""He was very interested in whether the mistress owned a green dress."" My curiosity peaked. ""And have you found one?"" I asked eagerly. ""No, sir. Not a green dress,"" she responded.",1
"The ""Colonel"" was a mastermind of systematic crime, orchestrating operations through his network of followers. His presence on the Kilmorden Castle indicated that Colonel Race was hot on his trail, working to bring him down. The danger was closing in, with enemies surrounding and watching closely. An unexpected turn of events led to a frantic escape, dodging arrest and boarding a train just in time. The unexpected appearance on the train surprised everyone, leading to a humorous interaction with Sir Eustace and his unconventional secretaries.",1
"“May I bring in this gentleman to assist?” Mr. Opalsen asked. The man nodded, showing no interest. “Now that your wife is feeling better, can she tell us what happened?” Mrs. Opalsen turned to Poirot for guidance. He motioned for her to sit and share the details. Mrs. Opalsen composed herself and began, “I went to my room after dinner to get my pearls. The chambermaid and Célestine were both present, as they always were.” Mr. Opalsen interjected, “What do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mrs. Opalsen clarified.",1
"""Well, I need to find some matches, I think I'll take a walk despite the weather. Excuse me, my friend, have you ever tried to read The Future of the Argentine, Mirror of Society, Cattle Breeding, The Clue of Crimson and Sport in the Rockies all at once?"" I chuckled and confessed that The Clue of Crimson was the only one I was currently focused on. Poirot shook his head in disappointment. ""Then why not put the others back on the shelf! You will never learn to appreciate order and method. What is the point of a bookshelf?"" I apologized sincerely, and Poirot, after returning the books to their proper places, exited, leaving me to enjoy my chosen book without any interruptions.",1
"As he performed the act, half of the spectators erupted in loud barks of ""Woof, woof!"" possibly a Dutch equivalent to ""Hear, hear,"" while the other half jolted awake from their peaceful slumber. I was informed that the man had been talking non-stop for a staggering three days. It appears patience is a virtue in South Africa. I concocted numerous reasons to detain Pagett in Cape Town, but my creativity has finally reached its limit. Tomorrow, he will accompany me with the loyalty of a faithful dog ready to meet his end by his master's side.",1
"“May I inquire as to your identity?” Poirot asked, taking a step closer and nodding respectfully. “I do hope that your husband won’t catch a cold. I couldn’t help but notice that he was wearing slippers and a rather warm dressing-gown.” “Who are you and what do you want?” demanded the woman, her voice filled with suspicion. “It is unfortunate that we have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, madame,” Poirot replied apologetically. “Especially considering that one of our party has traveled all the way from New York just to see you.” Suddenly, the curtains were drawn back and the figure of the Italian man emerged. To my dismay, I saw that he was holding my gun, which Poirot must have accidentally left behind in the taxi.",1
"I made a startling revelation: the window of opportunity for the theft was a mere five minutes, just before we arrived. Annie had been occupied with the stairs prior, eliminating the chance for anyone to sneak by. Picture it - he sneaks in, using a spare key to unlock the door. Rushing to the despatch-case, he realizes it's locked and the keys are missing. A major setback, as it exposes his presence in the room, shattering his hopes of remaining undetected.",1
"A dreadful act, undoubtedly, and I must admit to feeling a tinge of guilt in disclosing this to you, but the trials of finding a suitable apartment are well known."" I reassured her that I was fully cognizant of how the quest for living space often brings out the worst in people, and that the ruthless law of survival of the fittest always held true. ""And so we ascended, and can you imagine, the apartment was still available. The maid gave us a tour, we met the landlady, and the deal was struck on the spot. Immediate occupancy and fifty pounds for the furnishings. The contract was signed the following day, and we are scheduled to move in tomorrow!"" Mrs. Robinson concluded with a note of triumph.",1
"Deep down, he's all about business, that man! He seduced Lady Yardly, then he extorted money from her. I confronted her about it last night, and she confessed. She claimed it was just a mistake, and I trust her. But, Rolf definitely had some of her letters that could be misconstrued. Fearing a divorce and losing her kids, she caved to his demands. With no savings of her own, she had no choice but to let him swap the genuine gem for a fake one.",1
"""I have heard rumors,"" I began cautiously, ""that you have ties to the government, possibly even working in the Secret Service. Is there any truth to that?"" There was a brief pause, almost imperceptible, before he responded. ""Let me assure you, Miss Bedford, that I am simply a tourist enjoying my own private travels."" Reflecting on his response afterwards, I couldn't shake the feeling of ambiguity. It seemed intentional. We returned to the car in silence, making a pit stop for tea at a rustic roadside cafe on our way back to Bulawayo.",1
"""That's the kind of secret he would have kept from his wife and four children,"" I said, finally breaking the silence. ""Has anyone else heard about this?"" He shifted uncomfortably under my intense gaze. ""Only Miss Beddingfeld. She showed up at Kimberley Station."" I maintained eye contact, trying to read his expression. ""Sir Eustace, I hope you're not too upset by this revelation?"" ""My friend,"" I replied, ""I must confess that you've truly messed things up!"" I left feeling quite agitated. On my way, I couldn't resist the urge to stop by the corner curio-shop. The owner greeted me warmly, eager to assist.",1
"“I guess he had just managed to evade the foreign gentlemen, and my mother probably got the time wrong when they arrived. Or, was it all a setup after all? Did my mother really believe it couldn't have been me?” Poirot quickly reassured him. “No, no, Mr. Jack. Don't worry about that. I will clarify everything for you at some point. It's quite intriguing. But can you please tell us exactly what happened on that dreadful evening?” “There isn't much to say. I had come from Cherbourg, as I mentioned, to see Marthe before leaving for a faraway place. The train was delayed, so I took the shortcut through the golf course.”",1
"As Paynter administered a hypodermic injection to the man with a weak heart, he advised against any disturbances. Then, he inquired about the servants, asking how long they had been there and where they had come from. The housekeeper did her best to answer, though she was unsure of the significance of these questions. The next morning brought a horrifying discovery when a housemaid detected the smell of burnt flesh emanating from her master's locked study.",1
"""As a rallying cry for the Labour party, it would be impossible to resist. A Labour government right now would be a serious setback for British trade, but that's nothing compared to the true danger."" He stopped, then spoke softly: ""You might have heard rumors about Bolshevik influence fueling the current Labour unrest?"" Tuppence nodded. ""It's true. Bolshevik money is flowing into the country with the explicit goal of sparking a revolution. And then there's a man, a man whose true identity eludes us, working in the shadows for his own agenda. The Bolsheviks are fueling the Labour unrest, but this man is pulling the strings behind them. Who is he? We can't say.""",1
"I made my way to my cabin earlier than usual. The stewardess was informed that I was fighting a cold and was not bothered by any odors. Despite her concern, I stood my ground. The night dragged on endlessly. Eventually, I retired to bed, but not without preparing for the worst. I wrapped myself in a heavy dressing gown and slipped on my warm slippers. Fully dressed for action, I was ready to react to any unforeseen events. What exactly was I anticipating? The possibilities were unclear, a jumble of far-fetched scenarios raced through my mind.",1
"The French authorities, our own police force, and the army are all working tirelessly to solve this mystery. Despite their efforts, nothing has been uncovered yet."" As they spoke, there was a knock on the door. A young soldier entered, carrying a sealed envelope which he passed to Lord Estair. ""Fresh from France, sir. I rushed it over as per your instructions."" Lord Estair eagerly tore open the envelope and let out a gasp. The soldier exited the room. ""Finally, a breakthrough! This telegram has just been deciphered. They have located the second vehicle, along with the secretary, Daniels, who was drugged, silenced, and restrained at an old farm near C.""",1
"""The towering mountains loomed all around us, as we navigated the winding path upwards. “Is this the most efficient train to Rhodesia during the day?” inquired Anne Beddingfeld. “During the day?” chuckled Race. “My dear Miss Anne, there are merely three weekly trains. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Are you aware that we won't reach the Falls until next Saturday?” “We'll certainly be well-acquainted by then,” Mrs. Blair commented slyly. “How long do you plan to stay at the Falls, Sir Eustace?” “That remains to be seen,” I replied cautiously. “What does it depend on?” “How things unfold in Johannesburg.""",1
"His expression remained unchanged, a smirk playing on his lips. ""I have my eye on those diamonds,"" he declared. I shook my head. ""You won't be getting your hands on them,"" I retorted. ""Oh, but I will. Let's not beat around the bush. A few bodies turning up in this part of town wouldn't raise any eyebrows. There's a guy downstairs who takes care of those messy situations. Now, let's be reasonable. Write a letter to Harry Rayburn. Tell him to come here, diamonds in tow."" I stood my ground. ""I refuse to comply with your demands.""",1
"Johannesburg, March 6th. The atmosphere in this city is thick with tension, as if a storm is brewing just beneath the surface. It's like tiptoeing on the edge of a knife, never knowing when it will all come crashing down. Groups of protesters, or perhaps something more sinister, lurk in the shadows with a dangerous glint in their eyes. They seem to be marking their targets, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Even something as simple as taking a taxi becomes a risky endeavor, as these mysterious figures seem to have eyes everywhere, ready to pounce at a moment's notice.",1
"""What proof do we have that Ascanio and his accomplice, or two individuals impersonating them, actually visited the apartment that evening? No witnesses observed their entry or exit. Our only evidence comes from a solitary individual and an array of lifeless objects."" ""Are you suggesting?"" ""I am suggesting that the cutlery, dishes, and utensils speak volumes. It may have been a devious scheme, but Graves, despite his deceitful nature, is a master of organization. Having eavesdropped on part of the conversation earlier that day, he recognized Ascanio's vulnerable position. The next night, around eight o'clock, he fabricates an urgent phone call for his employer.""",1
"He walked past us without acknowledging our presence, but I couldn't help noticing his striking appearance - a lean, sun-kissed face that hinted at a life spent in tropical lands. Poirot approached the gardener, who had momentarily paused from his leaf-clearing duties. ""Do you know that gentleman?"" Poirot inquired urgently. ""He was here last week, Tuesday night."" We hurried after the mysterious man, witnessing a tense encounter with Mrs. Maltravers. As Poirot delved deeper into the investigation, a shocking revelation emerged, leading to a dramatic turn of events.",1
"All three individuals had consumed port, and the decanter, only halfway emptied, was placed in front of the central spot at the table. One of them had indulged in a cigar, while the remaining two opted for cigarettes. An elegant tortoiseshell-and-silver box, containing both cigars and cigarettes, was left ajar on the tabletop. I mentally noted these details, though they failed to illuminate the case for me. I pondered on what caught Poirot's attention in these specifics. When I inquired, he responded, ""My friend, you are overlooking the crucial detail. I am in search of something that remains unseen to me.""",1
"""Poor Dorcas, so brave. Let's check out that chest, even though it probably won't make a difference."" We snuck into the building through a window. The hallway was empty, so we headed straight for the attic. And there it was - the chest, an exquisite antique adorned with brass nails, bursting with all sorts of clothing. Poirot emptied the contents onto the floor without much care. Among the items were a couple of green fabrics in different hues, but Poirot dismissed them all with a shake of his head. His search seemed lackluster, as if he didn't anticipate any significant findings.",1
"""I rolled my eyes, a hint of irritation creeping in. “But don't worry, my friend,” Poirot reassured, his tone softening. “Not everyone can be as extraordinary as Hercule Poirot! I am fully aware of that.” “You really do have a high opinion of yourself,” I remarked, torn between amusement and exasperation. “What can I say? When one is truly unique, one cannot help but know it! And from what I gather, others seem to agree, including, if I'm not mistaken, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “No doubt about it. She's on her way here.” “How do you know that?” “It's quite simple.",1
"""I asked, 'What were you doing at that hour? Why weren't you in bed like a good Christian?' I was annoyed. Pagett always managed to be on the right side of things, playing the martyr. 'I was finishing the cabling work, Sir Eustace, and updating the diary,' he replied. 'Go on,' I urged. 'I decided to take a walk before retiring, Sir Eustace. I saw a man heading towards your cabin, and something about him seemed off. He hurried up the stairs near the saloon, and I trailed behind.'""",1
"""The inheritance was a shock to everyone. Renauld's wife inherited everything, while his son was completely left out. Many questioned the lack of trust Renauld seemed to have in his own son, despite his mother's love for him. This unexpected turn of events sheds new light on Renauld's relationship with his wife, proving that things may not have been as they seemed. The investigation continues, with hopes of uncovering more answers from Santiago.""",1
"""Poirot remained silent and gestured for the man to view the body. Instantly, the keeper confirmed the identity. ""That's him, no doubt,"" remarked the keeper callously; ""strange character, isn't he? Well, gentlemen, I must now make necessary arrangements. You won't have to endure the presence of the corpse much longer. If there's an inquest, you'll be required to attend, I presume. Good day, sir."" With an awkward bow, he exited the room. Shortly after, Japp made his entrance. The Inspector from Scotland Yard appeared as cheerful and well-dressed as ever.""",1
"As we drove away, he tipped his hat to Cynthia in a grand gesture. ""He's quite the charmer,"" she remarked. ""I had no clue you were acquainted."" ""You've unknowingly hosted a famous figure,"" I revealed. Throughout the journey home, I recounted the impressive feats of Hercule Poirot. Our return was met with a jovial atmosphere. Upon entering the hall, Mrs. Inglethorp emerged from her boudoir looking flustered. ""Oh, it's you,"" she sighed. ""Is everything alright, Aunt Emily?"" Cynthia inquired. ""Of course,"" Mrs. Inglethorp snapped.",1
"She was left feeling morally shattered after the clash with Julius's forceful demeanor. Plopping herself in front of the mirror, she gazed at her reflection in silence. ""Fool,"" Tuppence whispered, pulling a face. ""You have everything you desire, everything you've ever dreamed of, and yet you foolishly reject it like a naive little lamb. This is your only opportunity. Why let it slip away? Seize it? Grasp it? What else could you possibly need?"" Her own question echoed in her mind as her eyes landed on a faded photograph of Tommy resting on her vanity.",1
"""Upon hearing this, the Young Adventurers were momentarily stunned. However, Tuppence quickly regained her composure and bravely referenced a detective novel. ""When was the last time you saw your cousin?"" she inquired. ""I've never seen her,"" Mr. Hersheimmer replied. ""What?"" Tommy exclaimed, taken aback. Turning to Tommy, Hersheimmer explained, ""No, sir. As I mentioned earlier, my father and her mother were siblings, much like you two could be."" Tommy chose not to dispute this interpretation of their familial connection, knowing that his father and her mother did not always see eye to eye.""",1
"“Always stay vigilant for danger,” Mr. Rayburn warned me, his voice filled with urgency. “And remember, if you ever find yourself in their grasp, honesty may be your only salvation.”His words sent a shiver down my spine. “Your caution is unsettling, Mr. Rayburn,” I admitted, my heart racing with unease. “But why go to such lengths to protect me?”Mr. Rayburn fell silent, his expression grave. After a moment, he spoke softly, almost as if to himself: “This may be the final favor I can offer. Once ashore, I will be safe, but reaching land is not guaranteed.”“What do you mean?” I exclaimed, my mind reeling with the implications. “Are you suggesting that my knowledge of your identity as 'The Man in the Brown Suit' puts us both in jeopardy?”",1
"“Furthermore, how do you explain the excavation of the burial site? That required considerable effort.” “Perhaps she had assistance,” I proposed, reluctant to abandon my theory. “I move on to another issue. You mentioned the resemblance between the two incidents. What exactly is it, my dear companion?” I gazed at him in surprise. “Poirot, it was actually you who pointed that out! The account of the masked intruders, the ‘mystery,’ the documents!” Poirot smirked slightly. “Please, do not be so outraged. I stand by my observations. The likeness of the narratives inevitably ties the two scenarios together. However, consider now something quite peculiar.",1
"""May I inquire as to your identity?"" ""I am Prudence Cooper, ma'am."" ""Very well, Prudence. Please retrieve your belongings. I will be away for lunch. The cook will assist you in locating everything."" ""I appreciate it, ma'am."" Tuppence exited the room. The attentive Annie was nowhere to be seen. Downstairs in the grand hall, a distinguished porter had pushed Albert into obscurity. Tuppence didn't spare him a second glance as she left quietly. The journey had commenced, yet she felt less enthusiastic than earlier. The thought crossed her mind that if the mysterious Jane Finn had ended up in Mrs. Vandemeyer's clutches, things were likely to be grim.",1
"""Those high-ranking officials driving back and forth between the War Office and the Savoy made me sick!"" Tuppence admitted, unable to recall the name. ""That was the peak of my career. I later joined a Government office, where we had some enjoyable tea parties. I had plans to work as a land girl, postwoman, and bus conductress, but the Armistice changed everything. I held onto that job for months, but eventually got let go. Since then, I've been searching for work. Now it's your turn."" ""My job doesn't offer as much advancement,"" Tommy said sadly, ""and far less excitement.""",1
"He carefully inspected it, then swiftly pulled out tiny forceps from his bag to extract a minuscule fragment which he sealed in a small envelope. A tray on the dresser held a spirit lamp with a saucepan containing a dark liquid. Next to it sat an empty cup and saucer. I couldn't believe I missed this before. This was a valuable lead. Poirot cautiously dipped his finger into the liquid and sampled it with hesitation, resulting in a displeased expression.",1
"""It’s quite the hefty sum of cash, and besides,” she flashed a sly grin, “it would be unwise to underestimate a woman like me!” She paused, fingers lightly drumming on the table. Suddenly, her expression changed, her face draining of color. “Did you hear that?” “I didn’t hear a thing.” Mrs. Vandemeyer looked around nervously. “What if someone is eavesdropping?” “Don’t be absurd. Who would it be?” “Even the walls could be listening,” she whispered. “I’m telling you, I’m scared. You don’t know him!” “Just focus on the hundred thousand pounds,” Tuppence reassured her. Mrs. Vandemeyer licked her dry lips.",1
"I lapsed back into silence, pondering my own thoughts. Mrs. Renauld's words to her son echoed in my mind, taking on a new meaning. ""So you did not sail?"" she had asked, then followed with, ""After all, it does not matter now."" What was the significance of her words? They were cryptic, yet revealing. Could it be that she was privy to more information than we had assumed? Despite her denial of any involvement in her husband's secretive mission for their son.",1
"I scoured every corner, feeling increasingly frustrated. After slamming shut the final book, it became clear - Kilmorden Castle was nowhere to be found. This discovery was perplexing. Who would fabricate such a location and jot it down on paper? Ridiculous! Another possibility dawned on me. Maybe it was a pretentious mansion on the outskirts, adorned with a grandiose name coined by its wealthy owner. However, if that were the case, locating it would prove to be quite the challenge.",1
"“Indeed, Renauld, it is unfortunately true! A perfect little weapon, I suspect. Sleek and simple to wield.” “Where is it located? Can I have a look at it? Is it still inside the corpse?” “Oh, no, it had already been extracted. You desire to examine it? Just to confirm? It would be wise, I believe, even though madame has already recognized it. But M. Bex, could I ask you?” “Of course, M. le juge. I will retrieve it promptly.” “Might it not be preferable to bring M. Renauld to the barn?” proposed Giraud smoothly. “Undoubtedly he would want to see his father’s remains.",1
"""A curtain may be wisely drawn over the occurrences of the following thirty minutes. It is enough to reveal that the name ""Inspector Brown"" remained unfamiliar to Scotland Yard. The significant photograph of Jane Finn, crucial for police efforts to locate her, had vanished irretrievably. Once more, the elusive ""Mr. Brown"" emerged victorious. This setback promptly led to a reconciliation between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All obstacles dissolved suddenly, and Tommy and Tuppence sensed an instant connection with the youthful American.""",1
"I felt an intense surge of adrenaline. My keen deductive skills were triggered by Dr. Bauerstein’s peculiar behavior, sparking a whirlwind of theories in my mind. Mary Cavendish gripped my arm, a look of concern etched on her face. “What’s wrong? Why was Dr. Bauerstein acting so strangely?” I gazed at her intently. “I have a theory.” “What is it?” “Shh!” I glanced around, ensuring we were alone. Leaning in close, I whispered, “I suspect she’s been poisoned. And I believe Dr. Bauerstein shares that suspicion.” Mary gasped, her eyes widening in fear. Suddenly, she let out a cry of denial, “No, no, it can’t be!” With that, she broke away from me and hurried up the staircase.",1
"“No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” Poirot calmly pointed out. The inspector was taken aback by his confidence. Poirot then demonstrated his deductions swiftly, proving that the chambermaid couldn't have hidden the necklace. The inspector, satisfied, continued his search and found the necklace hidden in the maid's bed. Mrs. Opalsen was relieved to have it back, even though Poirot suspected it was an imitation. He decided to keep this information to himself, knowing that the true thief had not been caught. Poirot and his companion left the room, but Poirot's mind was already working on the next steps to solve the case.",1
"I realized we were entering the Ardennes, recalling Poirot mentioning a brother in Spa. Despite this, we bypassed Spa and veered off the main road into the hilly forests until we arrived at a secluded hamlet, with a solitary white villa perched on the hillside. The car halted in front of the green door, where an elderly man-servant greeted me in French, confirming my identity as M. le Capitaine Hastings. ""Monsieur le Capitaine is expected. If he will follow me,"" he said, gesturing for me to enter.",1
"""Oh, the world of fishing is diverse. I am tempted to linger and investigate the whereabouts of that young man."" ""Oh!"" Tuppence exclaimed with delight. ""Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, it's truly unfair of Carter to assign this task to you two youngsters. Now, please don't take offense, Miss "" ""Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But everyone calls me Tuppence."" ""Well, Miss Tuppence, since I am certainly going to be a companion. Don't be offended by my perception of your youth. Youth is a flaw that can be easily overcome. Now, let's discuss this young Tommy of yours."" ""Yes."" Tuppence interlocked her fingers. ""To be honest, the situation doesn't look good for him.""",1
"""You will have a Military officer and a C.I.D. man by your side, ready to assist you in any way. Does that meet your requirements?"" ""Certainly. Before you go, gentlemen, may I ask why you chose to seek me out? I am but a stranger in this vast city of London."" ""We were directed to you by a prominent figure from your homeland, based on his strong recommendation."" ""Ah, my dear old friend the Préfet?"" Lord Estair shook his head. ""Someone even higher than the Préfet. A figure of great authority in Belgium, whose power will be restored! An oath that England has taken!"" Poirot's hand swiftly rose in a dramatic salute.",1
"A few moments later, he returned with Mrs. Renauld. ""Madame is here,"" he announced. Giraud approached with a brief nod. ""Follow me, madame."" Leading her across the room, he suddenly stepped aside. ""Here stands the man. Do you recognize him?"" His piercing eyes studied her face intently, searching for any hint of emotion or familiarity. However, Mrs. Renauld remained unnervingly composed, almost too composed in my opinion. She gazed down at the body with little interest, showing no signs of distress or recognition. ""No,"" she replied calmly. ""I have never laid eyes on him before.""",1
"""And what about Mrs. Ferguson?"" inquired Parker. ""Let's hear your deductions, Hastings."" ""It's elementary, my dear Watson,"" I quipped. ""She simply went to the incorrect apartment."" ""Impressive, Captain Hastings,"" Mrs. Robinson exclaimed with admiration. In that moment, I found myself yearning for Poirot's presence. At times, I believe he underestimates my abilities. The entire situation was quite amusing, so I presented it as a playful puzzle to Poirot the next day. He appeared intrigued, probing me for details on flat rents in different areas. ""An intriguing tale,"" he mused.",1
"“And yet,” whispered the magistrate, “it seemed so promising at the start, such a simple and beautiful case.” His eyes briefly met Mrs. Renauld's, causing a sudden blush to spread across his face. “Ah, indeed,” he cleared his throat, shuffling through the documents scattered on the desk. “Now, where were we? Ah, yes, the murder weapon. I'm afraid this may be difficult for you, M. Renauld. I believe it was a gift from you to your mother. Quite tragic, very distressing.” Jack Renauld leaned in closer, his complexion turning from flushed to a ghostly pallor. “Are you suggesting that my father was killed with a mere aeroplane wire paper cutter? It can't be! Such a trivial object!” “Unfortunately, M.",1
"Count Foscatini. It appears there has been an incident at his residence,” he said, catching the man off guard. “I was unaware of any such occurrence. Mr. Graves, who works for Count Foscatini, left not long ago and mentioned nothing of the sort,” the man replied. “Is the Count by himself in the apartment?” “No, he is currently dining with two other gentlemen,” the man answered. “What can you tell me about them?” I inquired eagerly as we rode the elevator to the second floor where Flat II was located. “I did not personally see them, sir, but I believe they were foreigners,” he responded. As we arrived at the landing, facing No. II, the doctor pressed the doorbell.",1
"""He retreated and I was left to process this piece of information. Who was the mysterious woman who visited my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My expression darkened as I grasped the cleverness and boldness of my unidentified enemies. Gathering my thoughts, I exited my cabin and headed towards Mrs. Blair's. I rapped on the door. “Who is it?” her voice called out from inside. “It's Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I stepped inside. Various articles of clothing were strewn about, and Mrs. Blair was adorned in a stunning kimono. The colors of orange, gold, and black in the garment made my mouth water as I admired it.""",1
"Poirot's brow furrowed in confusion, causing me to lean in and ask softly, ""What's wrong?"" He dismissed my question with a shake of his head and inquired, ""Excuse me, M. Bex, but could M. Renauld have driven the car himself?"" The commissary glanced at Françoise, who quickly responded, ""No, Monsieur did not drive himself."" Poirot's expression darkened. ""I wish you would share your concerns with me,"" I urged. ""Don't you see? In his letter, M. Renauld mentioned sending the car for me in Calais."" ""Maybe he meant a rental car,"" I proposed. ""Probably, but why rent a car when you have your own?""",1
"Tuppence requested tea and toast, reminding the server to bring separate teapots. Tommy joined her at the table, his red hair slicked back perfectly. His face, though plain, had the air of a gentleman and athlete. Despite his well-cut brown suit nearing the end of its life, they made a strikingly modern pair.",1
"It started off like a scene from a love story. But now, stripped of its charm, it appeared to be shifting towards harsh reality. Tommy, that was the only thing that mattered. Throughout the day, Tuppence fought back tears. ""Silly girl,"" she scolded herself, ""no need to cry. You care for him, yes. You've been friends forever. But there's no reason to get emotional."" Meanwhile, Boris was nowhere to be found. He didn't show up at the apartment, leaving Julius and the car waiting in vain. Tuppence found herself lost in new thoughts.",1
"“I can’t believe how you managed to come up with that plan so quickly,” she exclaimed. Tommy shrugged. “I was desperate and had to think of something,” he replied. After a brief silence, Tommy brought up Mrs. Vandemeyer's death. “They’re saying it was heart failure caused by an overdose, or something like that,” he explained. “We don’t need to worry about an inquest. But I think Tuppence, Sir James, and I all have the same suspicion.” “Mr. Brown?” Tommy suggested. “Exactly,” he confirmed. “But even so,” Tommy added, furrowing his brow, “Mr. Brown can’t fly. I can't figure out how he managed to enter and exit the scene.”",1
"Near the end of the room stood a table with four chairs positioned around it. The first chair was unoccupied, adorned with a vibrant mandarin's cape. Mr. Abe Ryland lounged in the second chair, puffing on a cigar. Madame Olivier, with her intense gaze and austere countenance, reclined in the third chair. Number Four settled into the fourth chair. It was evident - we were face to face with the notorious Big Four. The absence of Li Chang Yen loomed over us, a reminder of his distant yet firm grip on the clandestine organization. A startled gasp escaped Madame Olivier as we entered the room.",1
"Amidst the circumstances, our group was far from jovial. The aftermath of a jolt is always taxing, and it appeared that we were all grappling with it. Etiquette and manners dictated that we maintain our composure, but I couldn't help but question the true challenge of this self-restraint. No teary eyes, no hint of hidden sorrow. I sensed that Dorcas was the one impacted the most by the emotional aspect of the ordeal. I won't dwell on Alfred Inglethorp, who portrayed the grieving husband in a way that I found repulsive in its insincerity.",1
"I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown. “Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair...",1
"""I truly believe so.” “They might have eloped,” I said, trying to calm the situation, even though I knew it was a foolish suggestion. But in a place like this, where would they go? I kept rambling, unsure of how much longer I could keep it up, until Race suddenly entered the room. I had been somewhat correct - he had been out for a walk, but Anne was not with him. My approach to the situation was completely off. Race quickly had the entire hotel in chaos within minutes.",1
"""The plea was desperate, but I had no other choice. I had to reach out to him, to beg for his help. I couldn't bear the thought of Jack being taken away from me. The pain was unbearable. I needed Poirot by my side, to unravel the truth behind this madness that threatened to consume us. Little did I know that the secrets hidden beneath the surface would soon be brought to light. Poirot's questions pierced through my soul, revealing a tangled web of deceit and betrayal. And as the truth slowly emerged, I found myself on my knees, begging for salvation.""",1
"""You see, Anne, Sir Eustace has been cleared of all charges. His guilt is certain, despite some technicalities. There is nothing to prevent you from being together now."" His voice was hesitant as he spoke, avoiding eye contact. ""I am aware,"" I responded with relief. ""And there is no obstacle to him reclaiming his true identity immediately."" ""Indeed, there is not."" ""Do you know his true name?"" The question caught me off guard. ""Yes, I do. It's Harry Lucas."" His silence in response felt unsettling, leaving me with a sense of unease.",1
"“Miss Murdoch also,” I added, “is completely truthful, nothing to hide there.” “Indeed. But it struck me as odd that she didn’t hear a thing, right next door; while Mrs. Cavendish, in a completely different part of the house, heard the table crash perfectly.” “Well, she is young. And she sleeps deeply.” “Ah, of course! She must be an exceptional sleeper, that one!” I found his tone slightly unsettling, but just then a sharp rap sounded, and peering out the window we saw the two detectives standing outside, waiting for us.",1
"""His face, once flushed with shock, turned deathly pale. 'An aeroplane wire paper cutter? That's what killed my father?' 'Yes, it seems so,' replied the detective. 'Sharp and easy to handle.' The tool had been removed from the body, but M. Renauld requested to see it. The commissary was sent to retrieve it. Meanwhile, Poirot noticed a pair of candlesticks out of place. Suddenly, the commissary burst in, alarmed. 'The dagger is gone!' 'Gone?' exclaimed the magistrate. 'Vanished. The glass jar is empty!' Everyone turned to the witness, who admitted to visiting the shed that morning with a young English lady. The magistrate scolded him for the irregularity, but softened at the mention of youth and beauty.""",1
"On the pretense of fetching her employer, she rushes upstairs, dons a colorful sweater and a cap adorned with black ringlets which she forcefully pulls over the gray wig. A couple of skillful adjustments, and the makeup is erased, a hint of blush applied, and the captivating Zoe Havering descends with her melodious voice. No one pays much attention to the maid. Why would they? There is no evidence linking her to the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the gun discovered in Ealing? Mrs. Havering couldn't have left it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s doing but they made a blunder.",1
"I always associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong, that is a lava-lava. All these things are very cheering after England. It would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of bacon-bacon and then go out clad in a jumper-jumper. Suzanne seemed calmer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a beautiful view over Table Bay. I gazed at the view while Suzanne searched for some special face cream. Once she found it and began applying it, she was able to listen to me.",1
"""The chauffeur, surprised by the attack, slammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister leaned out of the window. Without warning, two shots were fired. The first one barely missed his cheek, the second, thankfully, missed altogether. The chauffeur, understanding the peril, quickly sped forward, dispersing the group of assailants.""""A close call,"" I exclaimed, feeling a chill. ""Mr. MacAdam brushed off the minor injury he sustained. He insisted it was just a superficial cut.""",1
"""Every hen lays eggs of different sizes,"" he grumbled. ""No symmetry at the breakfast table. They should sort them properly."" Japp interrupted, ""Forget the eggs. Tell us where our customer went after leaving The Cedars."" Poirot replied, ""He went to his hiding place. Monsieur Davenheim's grey cells may have some malformation, but they are top-notch!"" Japp pressed, ""Do you know where he is hiding?"" Poirot confidently responded, ""Of course! It's quite clever.""",1
"""You and your loved ones will remain unharmed. I assure you of that."" I chuckled mockingly. ""And what if I choose not to follow your authoritative directive?"" ""It's more of a suggestion. Let's call it a caution?"" His voice held a chilling threat. ""Consider this the initial caution,"" he murmured. ""It would be wise for you to take it seriously."" Without warning, he stood up and swiftly made his way towards the exit. I leaped up and pursued him instantly, but unfortunately collided head-on with a massively obese man who obstructed my path to the adjacent table.",1
"""Plans are already set in motion. Daily discreet announcements will be made. Acquaintances and family members will be directed to contact my lawyer at his place of business. Perhaps today we might Ah, the telephone! It's likely just a mistake, and they will apologize for the inconvenience, but it's possible yes, it's possible that something has come up.""

I must acknowledge that I am well-suited for the job. I was involved in this case from its inception, I navigated every twist and turn, and I ultimately witnessed its conclusion firsthand.",1
"“I do not believe so. I felt an immediate connection with him. No, I am quite certain that Dr. Hall is trustworthy.” “Hall, you say?” inquired Sir James. “That is quite interesting, truly very interesting.” “Why?” Tuppence demanded. “Because I actually bumped into him this morning. I have had occasional contact with him over the years, and this morning I happened to see him on the street. He mentioned staying at the Métropole.” He looked at Julius. “Did he not mention that he was coming to the city?” Julius shook his head. “Interesting,” Sir James pondered.",1
"""Poirot agreed to join Lady Yardly and the children, quickly forming a bond with them. They played together and even managed to pull me into the fun. “You are a good mother,” Poirot complimented Lady Yardly, as the children were taken away by their nurse. Lady Yardly fixed her hair and confessed, “I adore them,” her voice filled with emotion. “And they adore you as well!” Poirot remarked. The sound of a dressing-gong signaled that it was time to retire to our rooms.""",1
"I followed her lead, purchasing a variety of trinkets for a mere “tiki” (threepence) each. The selection ranged from giraffes and tigers to snakes and a forlorn eland, not to mention comical little black warriors. The thrill was palpable as we reveled in the moment. Despite Sir Eustace's attempts to rein us in, our enthusiasm could not be contained. It's a wonder we weren't left stranded at some remote station along the route. South African locomotives depart without fanfare, silently slipping away as you scramble back on board. Suzanne's astonishment at my last-minute boarding in Cape Town was priceless.",1
"My father passed away when I was a child. A few years later, my mother also died. I was left with only my Uncle Andrew, who took me in and treated me like his own daughter. He strongly believed in practical skills over book knowledge and was against women receiving education. Despite his wishes, I pursued my studies and won a scholarship. When my uncle passed away, I discovered that he had left a challenging will, giving me a year to prove my intelligence. I sought the help of Monsieur Poirot to unravel the mystery hidden within Crabtree Manor. We were welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. Baker, who had worked for my uncle. The next morning, our investigation began in earnest in the late Mr. Marsh's study.",1
"""The crafty 'special table' turned out to be a devious contraption. The table I scrutinized was an exact replica, completely innocuous. It was swapped with the original right after the murder took place. The operation was orchestrated from the apartment below, which, as you may recall, was rented out fully furnished. However, at least one accomplice was present in Savaronoff's residence. The young woman is a mole for the notorious Big Four, scheming to claim Savaronoff's fortune."" ""And what about Ivan?"" ""I have a strong suspicion that Ivan is, in fact, the elusive Number Four."" ""No way!"" ""Yes. The man possesses an extraordinary talent for assuming different personas.""",1
"""Really?"" ""Did you not hear the news?"" ""What news?"" ""There was another murder last night!"" ""What?"" Abandoning my breakfast, I grabbed my hat and sprinted towards the scene. Another murder and Poirot was not around! What bad luck. But who was the victim? I burst through the gate. A cluster of servants stood in the driveway, chatting and gesturing. I grabbed Françoise. ""What's going on?"" ""Oh, sir! Another death! It's awful. There's a curse on this place. Yes, I'm saying it, a curse! They need to call for the priest to bring some holy water. I'll never spend another night under this roof. It could be me next, who knows?"" She made the sign of the cross.",1
"“Bauerstein.” “Any more faults to find with the evidence?” I inquired sarcastically. “Mon ami,” replied Poirot solemnly, “when you find that people are not telling you the truth watch out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the inquest today only one at most, two individuals were speaking the truth without reservation or deceit.” “Oh, come now, Poirot! I won’t mention Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But there’s John and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?” “Both of them, my friend? One, I admit, but both!” His words gave me an unpleasant jolt.",1
"""Fine,” Tommy replied, glancing at the Daily Mirror, “go ahead. I won’t interfere.” “Listen,” Tuppence interjected. “I’ve had an idea…” Her train of thought was cut short by a sudden round of applause. “It’s easy for you to joke around, Tommy. Maybe you should try using your brain for once.” “Sorry, Tuppence, but my contract strictly prohibits me from working before noon.” “Tommy, I swear, I will throw something at you. It’s imperative that we immediately devise a plan of action.” “Agreed!” “Let’s get started.” Tommy folded his newspaper and set it down decisively.",1
"""I'm sorry to say,"" Crowther began, his voice tinged with concern as he glanced at Poirot, ""that I've uncovered the true identity of Number Four. And now, my life is in imminent danger. He's known as 'The Destroyer' for a reason - he'll stop at nothing to eliminate me. Here, take this key and sealed envelope,"" Poirot continued, handing them over to Crowther. ""Inside are all my case notes and strategies to combat the looming threat that could strike at any moment. They're safely stored in a secure location. If anything happens to me, M.

She's been good to the Cavendishes, but she wasn't their real mother. Blood always tells, remember that."" ""Poirot,"" I inquired, ""can you please explain why you were interested in Mrs.",1
"""He was a man who once loved me,"" she said quietly. The Count raised an eyebrow, ""In South Africa?"" She nodded, confirming it as her native country. As her visitor prepared to leave, he warned her about underestimating the 'Colonel', suggesting he may be more dangerous than a mere disillusioned lover. She scoffed at the idea, confident in her knowledge of him. But as he left, his parting words lingered in the air, ""I wonder if you do? I very much wonder if you do.""",1
"“Of course, sir. You must understand that if I believed revealing these details would benefit my spouse, I would have done so. However, I did not find it relevant to the matter of his innocence or guilt.” “In a way, that is true, ma'am. But it helped me clear my mind of misunderstandings, allowing me to perceive other details more clearly.” “The will!” exclaimed Lawrence. “So, Mary, you were the one who got rid of the will?” She denied it, and Poirot did the same. “No,” he stated calmly. “There is only one individual who could have potentially destroyed that will, Mrs.…”",1
"“Your Honor,” I began, feeling a weight of guilt on my shoulders, “I must confess to a serious misstep that I deeply regret.” “Please, go on,” the judge urged. “I encountered a young woman, a friend of mine, who expressed a strong curiosity to explore every corner of the crime scene. Against my better judgment, I gave her access to the restricted area,” I admitted. The magistrate's expression hardened. “This is a grave error, Detective Reynolds. Your actions were reckless and completely out of line. Such behavior cannot be tolerated in our line of work.”",1
"Colonel Race was determined to see Sir Eustace face the consequences of his actions. Given Sir Eustace's network of spies and agents in Jo'burg, it was no surprise he had managed to escape. Colonel Race doubted they would ever be able to capture him, especially considering his well-thought-out escape plan. Despite my reservations, I nodded along as Colonel Race discussed the situation. The conversation fell quiet until Colonel Race inquired about Harry, to which I replied that he had left at dawn and I hadn't seen him since.",1
"""If she believes you're interested in getting to know her, she's flattered, and will find a way to make it happen."" ""You're giving me too much credit,"" Tommy whispered. ""Conversely,"" Tuppence continued, ""my millionaire would likely flee! No relationship is without challenges. The key is to earn money!"" ""We've attempted that, without success,"" Tommy pointed out. ""We have indeed exhausted all conventional options. But what if we were to explore the unconventional? Tommy, let's become adventurers!"" ""Absolutely,"" Tommy responded with enthusiasm. ""Where do we start?"" ""That's the dilemma. If we could establish a reputation, perhaps individuals would enlist our services to carry out illicit activities for them.""",1
"""It’s none of my concern. The coffee-cups are a mystery to me, except for those pristine Old Worcester ones that never see the light of day.

It’s all Greek to me.” “Fine.” As I started to walk back to the house, he unexpectedly beckoned me back.",1
"Manning set the time at around four-thirty, while William believed it was somewhat earlier. Cynthia Murdoch was the next to arrive, but had little information to offer. She had been unaware of the tragedy until Mrs. Cavendish woke her up. ""You didn't hear the table fall?"" ""No. I was fast asleep."" The Coroner chuckled. ""A clear conscience leads to peaceful sleep,"" he remarked. ""Thank you, Miss Murdoch, that will be all."" ""Miss Howard."" Miss Howard presented the letter from Mrs. Inglethorp dated the 17th evening. Poirot and I had already reviewed it. Unfortunately, it did not provide any new insights into the tragedy.",1
"""Isn't it rather the case of you being here without him, like a cart without a horse?"" His ill-timed jest lingered in the air as I made my way to the house. The door was opened by a middle-aged woman in black. I explained Mr. Havering's delay and my purpose there. She led me inside, closing the door behind us. The events of last night unfolded in her retelling - a mysterious man, a shot, and Mr. Pace left bleeding. The man with the black beard had vanished through the window before help arrived. Mrs. Havering was informed of my presence and descended the stairs promptly. Her vibrant presence was undeniable, even in the midst of tragedy. I introduced myself and she nodded in understanding.",1
"""Ugh, this blasted sand!"" ""Oh come now, Belgium has plenty of sand,"" I pointed out, recalling a vacation in Knocke-sur-mer surrounded by ""les dunes impeccables"" as the guidebook described. ""Not in Brussels,"" Poirot stated firmly. He stared at the Pyramids pensively. ""It's true that they, at least, have a solid and geometrical shape, but their uneven surface is rather displeasing.

"""No way!"" ""I'm right there with you,"" Ingles stated. ""Oh, by the way, I'll be heading to China as soon as I can."" ""Is that a good idea?"" ""Definitely not,"" replied Ingles sarcastically. ""But it's something I have to do. One must take risks."" ""You're very courageous!"" exclaimed Poirot with feeling. ""If we weren't in public, I'd give you a hug."" I sensed that Ingles seemed somewhat relieved. ""I don't think I'll be any more at risk in China than you are in London,"" he grumbled. ""That's probably true,"" conceded Poirot. ""I just hope they don't manage to harm Hastings as well. That would really upset me.""",1
"I was always the professional in this business, starting as a youngster with a knack for devising clever schemes. I never made the mistake of carrying them out myself - always employing experts. But Nadina was an exception. She knew too much. My downfall was trusting her. Now, reflecting on my failures, I realize where I went wrong. That imbecile Pagett was a pawn in my game, with his poisoner's face and old-fashioned ways. My sense of humor led me to keep him around, even though I knew it was unwise. But I digress.

"Cabin 17 held a mysterious allure, drawing in countless individuals. Despite the superior options available, both men remained fixated on this particular cabin.

The significance of the number 17 weighed heavily on their mind, especially in relation to a crucial date linked to the Kilmorden Castle's departure. What if their interpretation was flawed?",1
"""Oh, just by inquiring with her,"" responded Sir James casually. ""That's our usual approach, you see."" He drummed his fingers on the table, and Tuppence once again sensed the imposing aura that emanated from the man. ""And if she remains silent?"" Julius interjected abruptly. ""I believe she will cooperate. I possess certain influential tools. However, if by some chance she does not, there is always the option of persuasion."" ""Of course.

"Annette informed me of your escape. Cheer up. “Sincerely, “TWOPENCE.” Tommy called for Albert as soon as he read the letter. “Prepare my luggage! We're leaving!” “Of course, sir.” Albert hurried up the stairs. Was it Holyhead? Tommy was confused. He read further. Albert's footsteps echoed above. Then, a sudden realization hit Tommy. “Albert! I made a mistake! Don't pack that bag!” “Of course, sir.” Tommy pondered over the note. “Yes, I am a fool,” he muttered under his breath.",1
"""Without a doubt, if it weren't for his clever use of the cheese, a habit he seemed completely oblivious to, I could have easily mistaken the man in front of me for a stranger. 'He's onto you,' I whispered. 'You shouldn't have shown up.' 'Oh, my dear Hastings, I've played dead for months just for this moment.' 'To catch Number Four off guard?' 'Exactly. To catch him when he least expects it. And the best part is, he has no idea we know who he is. He believes he's safe in his new identity. I owe a debt of gratitude to Flossie Monro for sharing that little detail with us.""",1
"Papa never cared for others' opinions. He lived detached from daily life, eating without concern for payment. His celebrity brought no money, only trouble when a reporter twisted his words. I longed for romance and adventure, envying Emily's suitors. My only excitement came from daydreams and the Kinema. Yet, a discovery in Rhodesia would soon bring real adventure to my doorstep. Papa was ecstatic about the find, convinced it was the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. We had to leave at once to explore the area for more treasures.",1
"Poirot's revelation left us stunned. It seemed that Mr. Davenheim, the famous financier, had orchestrated his own disappearance to avoid the consequences of his financial misdeeds. The evidence pointed to a carefully planned scheme involving the theft of jewels and the creation of a false identity. As Poirot calmly explained his theory, it became clear that Mr. Davenheim had outwitted us all, hiding in plain sight where no one would think to look - in a prison. This unexpected turn of events shed a new light on the case, leaving us in awe of Poirot's brilliant deductive skills.",1
"That was an undeniable fact. An estate. Perhaps the origin of a noble bloodline. (Lost heir? Title contender?) Or maybe a charming dilapidated building. (Hidden riches?) Indeed, I was leaning towards the notion of hidden treasure. Enigmas always accompany hidden treasure. One step to the east, seven steps to the west, excavate one yard, descend twenty-two stairs. That type of concept. I could develop that later. The priority was to reach Kilmorden Castle promptly. I embarked on a calculated expedition from my quarters and came back loaded with research materials. _Who’s Who_, Whitaker, a Geographical Dictionary, a Compilation of Scottish Ancestral Dwellings, and a Publication on the British Isles. Moments slipped away.",1
"Nadina, the famous Russian dancer, received praise from the audience in Paris. As she left the stage, the Manager greeted her warmly. Later, Count Sergius Paulovitch visited her and they spoke in English about espionage suspicions and the retiring 'Colonel.' The Count mentioned a fortune-teller's prophecy about the 'Colonel's' downfall involving a woman, which intrigued Nadina. She revealed her plan to go to London incognito, leaving everyone unaware of her departure.",1
"""So, based on your knowledge, he didn't have any enemies, and you have no idea about any secrets that might have led to his murder?"" ""That's correct."" ""M. Stonor, have you ever come across the name Duveen in relation to M. Renauld?"" ""Duveen. Duveen."" He pondered the name for a moment. ""I don't believe so. Although it does ring a bell."" ""Are you familiar with a woman, a friend of M. Renauld's named Bella?"" Once again, Mr. Stonor shook his head. ""Bella Duveen? Is that her full name? It's strange! I feel like I've heard it before. But I can't recall the context at the moment.""",1
"“Visitors were not allowed below at that time, so, despite my apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia’s co-worker had to retrieve it for me.” “Did you have an idea of what you would uncover?” “No, not entirely. I simply realized that, based on your account, Monsieur Lawrence could have accessed the poison cabinet. The theory needed to be verified, or ruled out.” “Poirot,” I remarked, “your cheerfulness does not fool me. This is a crucial revelation.” “I am unsure,” Poirot responded. “But one thing stands out to me. Most likely, it has caught your attention as well.",1
"Tuppence and her companions, Sir James and Julius, escorted Mrs. Vandemeyer to the door. Tuppence fumbled for the key before realizing she had it herself. After unlocking the door, a thought crossed her mind - what if the woman had escaped? Julius quickly dismissed the idea, but Sir James remained silent. Tuppence took a deep breath and stepped inside, relieved to see Mrs. Vandemeyer on the bed. Ignoring the lack of response from the woman, Tuppence set down a cup of tea and went to open the blinds.",1
"Rayburn was taken aback by the sight of Guy Pagett. ""Pagett,"" he mumbled in disbelief. Rayburn seemed shocked by the revelation, but I couldn't help feeling a bit smug. ""You look like you've seen a ghost,"" I remarked. Rayburn's eyes narrowed. ""What's your role in all this? How much have you figured out?"" I flashed a knowing smile. ""Let's just say I know more than you think, Rayburn."" His grip on my arm tightened, his voice trembling as he demanded, ""Where did you hear that name?""",1
"”Oh, how fleeting these peaceful moments can be! The tranquility of my surroundings was abruptly interrupted by the unwelcome voice echoing through the hall. “Dr. Bauerstein!” Cynthia exclaimed with surprise. “What an unexpected visit.” My eyes involuntarily darted towards Mary Cavendish, but her composure remained unruffled, her complexion unchanged. Within minutes, Alfred Inglethorp had welcomed the doctor, who entered with a laugh, insisting he was in no state to be in a drawing-room. Indeed, he was a sight to behold, covered in mud from head to toe. “What on earth have you been up to, doctor?” Mrs. Cavendish inquired. “I must beg your forgiveness,” the doctor replied.",1
"""Interesting case."" ""Possibly aphasia?"" I proposed. The doctor scoffed immediately. ""Aphasia! Aphasia! No such thing. A product of fiction. No; the man has experienced some form of trauma. He's here driven by a persistent urge to locate M. Hercule Poirot, 14 Farraway Street and mindlessly repeats those words."" ""Psychogenic amnesia?"" I suggested hopefully. The doctor's reaction was less dismissive this time. Without a word, he handed the man a piece of paper and a pencil. ""Let's observe his response,"" he commented.",1
"""Poirot was the one to reveal the shocking truth to Jack Renauld, causing a tumultuous reaction. With his mother's support, Jack faced the reality of his father's criminal past. Poirot assured Jack that the truth would remain hidden from the world. Eventually, Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and secretary. Poirot encouraged Jack to seek out the woman who loved him unconditionally, despite his father's history. Meanwhile, Captain Hastings contemplated joining the Renaulds on their new adventure. As Poirot and Hastings watched Miss Mary Marvell from the window, they realized she was simply being followed by adoring fans and not involved in any criminal drama.""",1
"Mother will be pleased when father finally passes away so she can wed Dr. Treves. She's not my real mother, you see. I can't stand her. She's just waiting for my father to kick the bucket."" The situation was quite unsettling. Fortunately, Poirot didn't get a chance to respond before the doctor returned, forcing us to continue our conversation. Suddenly, Poirot slumped back in his seat, a pained expression on his face. ""What's wrong?"" exclaimed the doctor. ""Just a sudden spasm. I'll be fine. I don't need your help, doctor. I just need to lie down for a bit.""",1
"""Ha!” exclaimed the inspector, slamming his hand onto the desk. “You dare play games with the authorities, do you? I insist you reveal the identity of the woman who visited Mr. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police, the police,” muttered Françoise. “I never imagined I would get involved with the police. But I know exactly who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissioner gasped in shock and leaned in closer. “Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite nearby?” “Exactly, sir,” Françoise confirmed.",1
"""Would you care for some wine, mademoiselle? Perhaps some champagne?"" Miss Monro remained silent, her thoughts a mystery. The meal began smoothly, with Poirot attentively refilling the lady's glass, before subtly shifting the conversation to a familiar name. ""Ah, the unfortunate Mr. Darrell. How I wish he were here with us."" ""Yes, indeed,"" sighed Miss Monro. ""I often wonder where he has gone."" ""It has been quite some time since you last saw him, hasn't it?"" ""Oh, it's been ages, not since the war. Claudie was a peculiar boy, kept his secrets close to his chest, never revealing a thing about himself.""",1
"“Who was it that Madame Renauld loved so deeply that upon discovering his lifeless body, she succumbed to a faint?” I was taken aback. “Her spouse?” I uttered. Poirot confirmed. “Her spouse, or Georges Conneau, as you wish to refer to him.” I composed myself. “But that seems highly unlikely.” “Why so ‘unlikely?’ Did we not just establish that Madame Daubreuil had leverage over Georges Conneau?” “Indeed, but” “And did she not successfully use that leverage against Mr. Renauld?” “That may be the case, however” “And do we not lack any information about M.",1
"""Anne, do you recall telling me that women often do things they dislike for someone they care about?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, curious about his intentions. He embraced me tightly. ""Anne, run away with me tonight. Let's go back to Rhodesia, back to the island. I can't endure all this foolishness any longer. I can't keep waiting for you."" I pulled away for a moment. ""And what about my collection of French dresses?"" I lamented in a playful tone. Harry still struggles to differentiate when I am serious and when I am simply teasing him. ""Forget your French dresses.",1
"""Comme ça! A magnificent stone without a flaw,"" he exclaimed as he examined the jewel closely. ""You will leave it with me, n’est-ce pas?"" Miss Marvell explained her plan to visit Yardly Chase with the diamond, despite Poirot's suggestion against it. The conversation turned to the famous Star of the East diamond in the Yardly collection, sparking Poirot's interest. Suddenly, Gregory Rolf, a dashing actor, entered the room, discussing the upcoming trip. Poirot advised against taking the diamond, causing tension between Mary and her husband. Despite Mary's protests, Poirot stood firm in his decision.",1
"""Given his urgent demeanor, I promptly presented his card, identifying him as Mr. Roger Havering,"" she said, handing me the slip of paper. Poirot directed me to the bookcase, where I retrieved ""Who's Who."" After scanning the pages, he noted, ""Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb."" ""Ah,"" I mused. ""I believe she was the actress at the Frivolity, though she went by Zoe Carrisbrook. I recall her marrying a young socialite before the War.""",1
"""I was clearly inebriated when I approached Race. Clearly. Mark my words, Pagett, let your bruised eye serve as a cautionary tale, abstain from excessive drinking in the future."" ""As you are aware, I abstain from alcohol, Sir Eustace."" ""It's much wiser to commit to sobriety if you struggle with such temptations. Have I approached anyone else, Pagett?"" ""Not to my knowledge, Sir Eustace."" I breathed a sigh of relief. ""There's Miss Beddingfeld,"" I mused. ""She's eager to travel to Rhodesia for archaeological excavations, I believe. I'm considering offering her a temporary position as a secretary.""",1
"“We need to locate him. However, I’ve been lost in thought ever since this journey began and these thoughts are unproductive. I’m done with them. Miss Tuppence, there’s something I want to inquire about.”  “What is it?”  “You and Beresford. What’s the deal?”  “I don’t follow,” Tuppence responded with dignity, then added somewhat randomly: “And, by the way, you’re mistaken!”  “Don’t you have some affection for each other?”  “Absolutely not,” Tuppence retorted passionately. “Tommy and I are just friends.”  “I suppose every couple has claimed that at some point,” Julius remarked.",1
"""Do you young people prefer artificial lighting, or do you revel in the twilight?"" she inquired. ""Cynthia, would you be so kind as to deliver Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee? I shall handle the pouring."" ""No need to trouble yourself, Mary,"" Inglethorp interjected. ""I will bring it to Emily."" With a careful hand, he poured the coffee and exited the room. Lawrence trailed behind him, leaving Mrs. Cavendish to take a seat beside us. The three of us remained in silence for a while. The night was magnificent, warm and motionless. Mrs. Cavendish gently fanned herself with a palm leaf. ""It almost feels stifling,"" she whispered. ""A thunderstorm must be on its way.""",1
"John's composure in the witness stand was remarkable. With Sir Ernest's expert guidance, he recounted his story convincingly and confidently. The mysterious note he had received was presented to the jury for scrutiny. John's honesty about his financial struggles and his strained relationship with his stepmother added weight to his assertions. As he concluded his testimony, he made a firm declaration: ""I want to be clear. I completely reject Sir Ernest Heavywether's accusations against my brother. I am certain that my brother is innocent, just as I am."" Sir Ernest simply smiled, observing keenly that John's defense of his brother had made a positive impact on the jury.",1
"I quickly ascended the stairs, my mind heavy with the weight of the tragedy. The room where the body was discovered was eerily silent, the only echo of the past being the muddy footprints left behind by the intruders. The police had already combed through the room, leaving nothing of interest in their wake. As I examined the plain white walls and bare floor, a glimmer of hope emerged when my pencil rolled under a window-seat cupboard. Retrieving it, my hand brushed against a forgotten roll of Kodak films. The fresh red paper hinted at a recent deposit, leading me to wonder who had dropped it - the woman or the man? The familiar scent of moth balls lingered on the films, igniting my suspicions once again.",1
"""I wonder where his plan to deceive me will lead? A woman's hair, hmm!"" The meal was satisfying, yet Poirot seemed preoccupied and distant. Later, in our room, I pressed him to share details of his enigmatic trip to Paris. ""Of course, mon ami. I journeyed to Paris for this."" He produced a faded newspaper clipping from his pocket, displaying a woman's photograph. I gasped. ""You know her, my friend?"" I nodded, recognizing the unmistakable likeness despite the dated style of the photo.",1

Nothing more, nothing less,' he instructed. 'So, 'Find the missing puzzle piece, and all will be revealed,' right?' I inquired, feeling puzzled. 'Precisely,' he confirmed. 'But what does it mean?' I pressed. 'Ah, that's for you to figure out. You have all the information you need.'""",1
"""The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. Is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds? The last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the morning of the 23rd. All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. The man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft. Ah, here we are. You permit?”",1
"“Excuse me, Sir James,” Tuppence interjected, “I realize this is rather forward of me to intrude upon your time. You are, after all, a person of great importance, unlike Tommy and myself.” She took a moment to compose herself before continuing. “Tommy?” inquired Sir James, glancing at the man beside her. “Oh, that’s Julius,” Tuppence clarified. “I apologize for my nervousness, it tends to cloud my words. The real question is, what was the intention behind your words to me the other day? Were you trying to warn me about Mrs.…”",1

Curiosity isn’t a good trait for young boys. So, why are you here? Tagging along with the M.P., I presume, playing the carefree youth on the shore.” I disagreed. “Think again. Remember when I mentioned my close friend is a detective?” “Yes?” “And I’m sure you’re familiar with the recent incident at the Chateau Belle?” She gazed at me.'",1
"Inglethorp herself!” “Impossible!” I exclaimed. “She had only made it out that very afternoon!” “Nevertheless, mon ami, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other way can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of the year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.” I gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as being incongruous! Poirot was continuing: “The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade. Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy something, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper was thrown away.",1
"As they wandered along the outskirts, they encountered a laborer carrying a bag of tools. Tommy approached him, inquiring about the Moat House. The workman informed them that the house had been vacant for years and directed them to Mrs. Sweeny at the post office for the key. Expressing gratitude, they located the post office, a charming establishment that doubled as a sweet and general store. Knocking on the door of the neighboring cottage, a tidy and welcoming woman answered. Without hesitation, she handed over the key to the Moat House, cautioning Tommy about its poor condition. ""Not sure if it's up to your standards, sir. The place is falling apart, with leaky ceilings and all.""",1
"M. Hautet bid us farewell, laughing heartily and enchanted with himself. Poirot, on the other hand, called him an old imbecile, showing his disdain. Just as we were leaving the building, we ran into Giraud, looking pleased with himself. Poirot hinted that the end of the case was near, but Giraud was dismissive. Poirot then challenged Giraud to a bet, claiming he would find the real murderer before him. Despite Giraud's initial reluctance, he finally agreed. As we walked, Poirot's determination was evident, causing me to doubt my ability to protect Bella. Suddenly, Gabriel Stonor joined us, expressing his belief in Jack Renauld's innocence. Stonor's words gave me hope in the midst of uncertainty.",1
"""It's clear that you're suppressing your own intuition, denying the truth that lingers beneath the surface,"" Miss Howard protested with a sudden burst of emotion, waving her hands in distress. ""Please, spare me. I can't bear to hear it. It's a lie! How could I even entertain such a horrifying notion?"" Poirot inquired if his deductions were correct, to which Miss Howard reluctantly confirmed. ""You have an uncanny ability to discern the truth. But it's inconceivable. It has to be Alfred Inglethorp,"" she reasoned. Poirot silently disagreed. ""I can't discuss this further,"" Miss Howard declared firmly. ""I refuse to acknowledge it, not even to myself. I must be insane to entertain such thoughts.""",1
""" Tuppence was on the verge of objecting, but as she shifted her gaze towards the bed, she noticed Mrs. Vandemeyer. Her eyes were only partially open, yet the look of sheer terror and malice etched on her face silenced Tuppence instantly. She questioned if the fainting spell and heart attack were all an elaborate act, but the ashen complexion of Mrs. Vandemeyer made that theory hard to believe. In an instant, the unsettling expression vanished, leaving Mrs. Vandemeyer lying still and lifeless once more. Tuppence briefly thought she had imagined it all, but resolved to stay vigilant nonetheless.""",1
"As I surveyed the room, it was clear that the boudoir had been neglected that morning. Traces of brown mould and earth surrounded the desk, indicating a recent disturbance. The weather had been uncharacteristically fine, ruling out the possibility of ordinary boots causing such a mess. Walking over to the window, I noticed the freshly planted begonia beds below. The mould in the beds matched the one in the boudoir, a detail you had informed me about - they were indeed planted the day before. It became evident that one, if not both, of the gardeners had trespassed into the boudoir, as evidenced by the distinct footprints in the bed.",1

That moment sparked an idea - I decided to insinuate myself into his circle as his personal assistant. The snippet of their conversation provided a vital clue. Doubt began to creep in regarding Sir Eustace Pedler's true identity as the 'Colonel.' Perhaps his residence was chosen as a meeting point by chance, or for a hidden agenda that eluded me.""",1

It struck me that it was about time I shared a lion-related anecdote as well, albeit of a livelier nature. ""Speaking of which,"" I interjected, ""I recall a rather thrilling story I was told. A companion of mine was on a hunting expedition in East Africa. One evening, he exited his tent for a particular purpose and was taken aback by a faint growl.

Irritated by the miss, the lion emitted a growl and readied itself for another leap.""",1
"Perhaps this lingering sense of urgency was a remnant of my time on short leave during the war. It had been crucial to claim a spot near the gangway and be among the first to disembark, ensuring no precious minutes of my three or five days' leave were wasted.

But maybe their circumstances were unlike mine.",1
"Upon arrival, I immediately noticed the absence of a laurel bush, leading me to believe that its name was simply a product of suburban whimsy. We were escorted inside by a stoic Chinese servant and introduced to the enigmatic Mr. Ingles. His sturdy frame and sallow complexion were overshadowed by his piercing, introspective eyes. As he rose to welcome us, he casually put down a letter he had been reading, only to pick it up again shortly after exchanging pleasantries.",1
"The incident on the Underground, brushed off as mere chance, slipped from the public consciousness. But was it truly random? I harbored doubts. While the Tube mishap held a personal intrigue for me, there appeared to be a link between the two deaths.

"I realized the enormity of the task I had set for Poirot. It would not be easy to secure Jack Renauld's acquittal. M. Hautet suggested that Madame Renauld may have been mistaken about the dagger, insinuating Jack's guilt. Jack's response only fueled further suspicion, leading to his inevitable condemnation by M. Hautet. Just as all hope seemed lost, a mysterious figure named Bella Duveen appeared, confessing to the murder of Mr. Renauld. Bella's confession shed light on the events leading up to the crime, revealing a tangled web of deceit and desperation.",1
"I was taken aback when he unexpectedly revealed that Ascanio himself would be visiting him at eleven o’clock. “He’s coming to consult you?” I asked. “Not at all, Hastings. I wish to consult him,” was his surprising response. “Regarding what?” I inquired. “The Regent’s Court murder.” “Are you planning to prove his guilt?” I asked. “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Use your common sense. Ah, here he is now,” he said as the doorbell rang. Shortly after, Signor Ascanio arrived - a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive gaze, casting suspicious looks around the room.",1
"We then entered a lush valley that stretched for several miles before the rugged rocky peaks started to appear, surrounded by thick pine forests. The entire area had a rugged yet beautiful quality to it. After navigating through a series of sharp turns, with the road flanked by pine trees, we unexpectedly arrived at a large hotel. With Harvey leading the way, our pre-booked rooms awaited us and we headed straight towards them.",1
"I couldn't help but wonder how he managed to enter and exit without being noticed in such a small town. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the footprints in the kitchen from the previous night's rain revealed the truth. In the living room, there were only two sets of footprints - one belonging to Mr. Whalley in his carpet slippers, and the other to an unknown man who had stepped in the blood stains. I carefully followed the trail of bloody footprints, leading me to the shocking conclusion.",1
"Mrs. Blair surprised me the next morning by stopping by my chair after walking on the deck with Colonel Race. She mentioned the idea of a funeral at sea being exciting, but I had recovered from feeling ill. Colonel Race and Mrs. Blair then suggested I change to a better cabin, as there were plenty available. Mrs. Blair tried to take a photograph of the Grand Peak of Tenerife, but her camera was set on 'bulb' mode the whole time. As she reached for the rail, the roll of films fell overboard. The sound of a bugle announced lunch, which Mrs. Blair eagerly welcomed after only having two cups of beef-tea since breakfast.",1
"Swiftly, I pondered the situation. The brightness intensified. Poirot's enigmatic actions, his insinuations all fell into place. How foolish I had been not to consider this possibility earlier, and what a relief for all of us. ""No, John,"" I declared, ""it is not one of us. How could it be?"" ""I understand, but, nonetheless, who else could it be?"" ""Can you not speculate?"" ""No."" I glanced around discreetly, and spoke softly. ""Dr. Bauerstein!"" I murmured. ""Inconceivable!"" ""Not in the least."" ""But what possible motive could he have in my mother's demise?"" ""That eludes me,"" I admitted, ""but I can say this: Poirot believes so.""",1
"He had to find a place to hide the incriminating slip of paper. The trash was not an option as it would surely be searched. Unable to destroy it, he frantically looked around the room for a solution. Suddenly, he had an idea. Swiftly tearing the letter into thin strips, he rolled them into spills and concealed them among similar spills in a vase on the mantle. It was a clever hiding spot, one that no one would suspect.",1
"""Six months."" ""You sure it's her? The woman I saw was tall, fair, with reddish-gold hair."" ""That's her,"" confirmed the porter. ""They arrived in the Michaelmas quarter, precisely six months back."" He lost interest and walked away. I followed Poirot outside. ""Well, Hastings?"" my friend asked with a smirk. ""Still think charming women are always honest?"" I stayed silent. As we walked down Brompton Road, I finally asked Poirot about his plan and our destination.",1
"John left me, and a few minutes later I caught sight of him through my window strolling leisurely across the lawn with Cynthia Murdoch by his side. I overheard Mrs. Inglethorp's irritated call for Cynthia, prompting the girl to rush back to the house. Simultaneously, a figure emerged from the darkness of a nearby tree and proceeded in the same direction. This man appeared to be around forty years old, with a somber, clean-shaven face. A surge of intense emotion seemed to be consuming him. As he passed beneath my window, he glanced up, and despite the significant change in his appearance over the past fifteen years, I recognized him immediately. It was John's younger sibling, Lawrence Cavendish.",1
"Foscatini takes a seat, reaching for the telephone, when suddenly Graves attacks him from behind with a marble statue. In a rush to cover up the crime, dinner for three is arranged through the service telephone. The table is set, dishes dirtied, and food consumed - but disposing of the evidence proves more challenging. Despite his cunning intellect, Foscatini struggles to stomach three tournedos and a rice soufflé. Desperate to maintain his facade, he even indulges in a cigar and two cigarettes.",1
"Poirot and I arrived in Saint-Omer, ready to face the grim reality of Jack Renauld's imprisonment. The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, welcomed us warmly, expressing his concern for Madame Renauld's well-being. As we discussed the case, Poirot remained cautious, unwilling to reveal his true thoughts about the situation. The magistrate shared his frustrations with Jack's lack of defense, leaving us all puzzled by his silence. Despite the challenges ahead, I trusted in Poirot's abilities to uncover the truth and bring justice to those involved. We left the magistrate's office with a sense of foreboding, knowing that the mystery surrounding Jack Renauld's arrest was far from being solved.",1
"Tommy let out a quiet sigh of relief. “Ah, you wealthy folks! You speak a different language altogether! Hop on the boat. Here’s your pass. Whittington is the one you want.” “I'm heading to Whittington!” Julius muttered ominously. The locomotive was in motion as he hoisted himself onto it. “Goodbye, Tommy.” The locomotive departed from the platform. Tommy exhaled deeply. The figure Boris was approaching him on the platform. Tommy allowed him to pass before resuming the pursuit. Boris took the subway from Waterloo to Piccadilly Circus. He then strolled up Shaftesbury Avenue, eventually veering off into the intricate network of streets around Soho.",1
"“I’m instructing you on how to face reality head-on. I’m teaching you to embrace toughness and ruthlessness, qualities that have led to my own success.” “I’d rather be dead than lose my compassion,” I declared fervently. We climbed into the car and set off. I took a moment to compose myself. Then, unexpectedly, he reached for my hand. “Anne,” he murmured softly, “I need you. Will you marry me?” I was caught off guard. “Oh, no,” I faltered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t have romantic feelings for you. I’ve never seen you in that light.” “I understand. Is that the only reason?” I knew I had to be truthful. I owed him that much. “No,” I confessed, “it is not.”",1
"""I still have a good amount of cash. Mrs. Flemming's twenty-five pounds is untouched, and I also won the sweepstakes yesterday, adding another fifteen pounds to my stash. I am sitting pretty with forty pounds!"" ""Forty pounds! Goodness!"" gasped Mrs. Blair. ""I couldn't do it, Anne, and I consider myself brave in my own way. I couldn't just set off cheerfully with a handful of coins and no plan of action or destination in mind."" ""But that's the thrill of it,"" I declared, feeling energized. ""It's the sense of adventure that makes it so exhilarating."" She gazed at me, nodded thoughtfully, and then broke into a smile. ""Lucky Anne! Not many share your outlook on life.""",1
"""Did you not notice her abnormally possessive nature? Her pride and envy have vanished. She only concerns herself with her spouse and the impending doom awaiting him,"" he expressed emotionally. I gazed at him intently, recalling the previous afternoon when he debated whether to reveal the truth. I was relieved that he no longer had to decide, given his compassion for ""a woman's well-being."" ""Even now,"" I remarked, ""it's hard to accept. I was convinced it was Lawrence until the very end!"" Poirot smirked.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, everyone fast asleep. Poirot's eyes focused on the open window of Mrs. Renauld's bedroom. A cry for help pierced the silence, followed by a struggle in the room. Poirot sprang into action, trying to break down the locked door. Meanwhile, Cinderella, the acrobat, swung from the roof to save the day. The mystery unraveled as Marthe Daubreuil's lifeless body was discovered, revealing the truth behind Mr. Renauld's murder. Poirot's keen observations and deductions ultimately led to the unravelling of the complex case.",1
"Intrigued by the mysterious case of the stolen Naval plans, Poirot embarks on a daring plan to uncover the truth. As he and Hastings move into a flat in Montagu Mansions, they soon discover that there is more to their new neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, than meets the eye. With a cleverly devised scheme involving descending through the coal-lift, Poirot sets the stage for an unexpected turn of events. The following day, as Poirot shares the details of the stolen plans and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the deaths of Luigi Valdarno and Miss Elsa Hardt, Hastings realizes that they are about to embark on a thrilling adventure that will test their wits and courage to the fullest.",1
"As I observed the man, I noted his petite frame and tanned complexion, coupled with piercing blue eyes and a neatly trimmed beard. ""Freshly returned from a foreign land,"" I concluded. ""The scent of his overcoat gives away his recent journey from India. Not military, for a soldier would be clean-shaven. Could he be a tea cultivator instead?"" Suddenly, the man pivoted, as if considering retracing his path on the platform. His gaze briefly met mine before shifting to a point beyond, causing a sudden transformation in his expression - one of terror bordering on sheer panic.",1
"""Given the circumstances, I decided to postpone my trip. But when I read the distressing news in the newspaper, I rushed to offer my assistance. Perhaps you could use some help in managing things for a while."" Just then, they noticed our presence. Poirot took a step forward and, after apologizing profusely, mentioned that he had left his cane in the hallway. Somewhat reluctantly, it appeared to me, Mrs. Maltravers performed the necessary introductions. ""Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black."" A brief conversation followed, during which Poirot discovered that Captain Black was staying at the Anchor Inn.",1
"""Indeed, I was taken aback. I had assumed that Miss Anne would be actively involved here, gathering material for the Daily Gazette."" ""Kimberley,"" he muttered. The mere mention of it seemed to disturb him. ""There's nothing worth seeing there, the mines are no longer operational."" ""You know how women can be,"" I remarked vaguely. He shook his head and walked away. I seemed to have given him something to ponder. As soon as he left, my Government contact returned. ""I hope you don't mind me coming to you once more, Sir Eustace,"" he said apologetically. ""But there are a couple of things I would like to inquire about."" ""Of course, my friend,"" I responded with a smile.",1
"""Is the book here?” “Yes, sir.” It was handed over; and, after a few harsh words, the Coroner dismissed Mr. Mace. Then, with a tense quiet in the room, Alfred Inglethorp was summoned. Did he understand, I pondered, how close the noose was tightening around him? The Coroner got straight to the point. “Last Monday evening, did you buy strychnine to poison a dog?” Inglethorp replied calmly: “No, I did not. There is only an outdoor sheepdog at Styles, which is perfectly healthy.” “Are you absolutely sure you didn't purchase strychnine from Albert Mace last Monday?” “Yes, I am.”",1
"""Monsieur Henri, a long-time confidant."" The young man, with a slight build and deep complexion, nodded abruptly. Poirot surveyed the surroundings. In addition to the entrance we came through, there were two other doors. Madame clarified that one opened to the garden, while the other led to a smaller room used for research. Poirot absorbed all of this information before indicating his readiness to go back to the main room. ""Madame, were you in the company of M. Halliday alone during your conversation?"" ""Yes, sir. My two assistants were in the adjacent room.""",1
"""Unfortunately, the Prime Minister’s vehicle inexplicably veered off the main road,” Poirot interjected. “Around a bend in the road?” “Yes, but how did you surmise that?” “Oh, it’s obvious! Please, go on.” Lord Estair continued, “Without explanation, the Prime Minister’s car departed from the main road. Meanwhile, the police vehicle, oblivious to the detour, stayed on the main route. Further along the deserted path, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly halted by a group of masked individuals. The driver” Poirot mused, “That courageous O’Murphy!”",1
"I believe the threat is close at hand, so I urge you to swiftly travel to France. Notify me of your arrival time and I will arrange for a car to pick you up in Calais. Please set aside your current cases and focus solely on my affairs. I am willing to cover any expenses required. Your assistance will likely be needed for an extended duration, including a potential trip to Santiago, where I resided for many years. Your fee is entirely up to you.",1
"“She couldn’t recall her own identity, her origins, or her whereabouts. Communication in her native language was impossible.” “This is highly unusual, isn’t it?” Julius interjected. “Not at all, my friend. It’s a common reaction to trauma. Memory loss tends to follow a predictable pattern. I recommended a specialist, naturally. There’s a renowned expert in Paris who specializes in cases like hers, but Mrs. Vandemeyer rejected the idea of attracting unwanted attention.” “I understand her concerns,” Sir James remarked grimly. “I agreed with her decision.”",1
"Poirot smirked, ""I don't think so, my friend. Catching Hercule Poirot is no easy feat."" I was taken aback, ""Oh my goodness."" Poirot furrowed his brow in thought. ""There's still one thing that puzzles me."" ""What's that?"" I inquired. ""The timing, Hastings, the timing. If they were trying to lure me away, wouldn't night time be more suitable? Why choose this early hour? Could it be that something is set to occur this morning? Something they desperately want to keep from Hercule Poirot?"" He shook his head. ""Only time will tell. We stay put, my friend. No ventures outside this morning. We wait for whatever is to come.""",1
"""It appeared that Ryland was in search of an English secretary with a refined social demeanor. Poirot, in his usual fashion, suggested that I apply for the position. ""I would offer to do it myself, my friend,"" he said regretfully. ""But alas, I would struggle to conceal my true identity effectively. While my English is proficient, any excitement would surely give me away. Even if I were to part with my beloved moustaches, I fear I would still be unmistakably Hercule Poirot."" I concurred with his assessment and volunteered to undertake the task of infiltrating Ryland's inner circle. ""Chances are slim that he will hire me in any case,"" I added with a shrug.",1
"""But entirely superfluous."" ""Superfluous!"" I exclaimed, taken aback. ""Given the man was poisoned "" ""Ah,"" exclaimed Poirot, seizing a note on the table. ""From Japp. Just as I suspected."" He tossed it towards me. It was concise and straight to the point. No evidence of poison had been discovered, and there was no indication of how the man met his demise. ""You see,"" Poirot remarked, ""our inquiries would have been entirely superfluous."" ""You anticipated this?"" ""'Predicted the likely outcome of the transaction,'"" Poirot recited from a recent Bridge dilemma that had occupied much of my time. ""My friend, when you achieve that successfully, it is not called guessing.",1
"As the train pulled into Charing Cross, Jane Finn jolted awake. ""Are we there already? I never expected it!"" ""London was inevitable. The real excitement starts now. Hurry, let's grab a taxi."" Within moments, they were through the barrier, settled the fares, and climbed into a waiting taxi. ""King's Cross,"" Tuppence instructed. Suddenly, she noticed a man peering in through the window, the very same man from the neighboring carriage.",1
"“Running late, are you! Oh, dear me, I surrender!” exclaimed Mr. Beresford. “Honestly,” Tuppence added, widening her eyes, “I don’t have anything smaller than a fiver.” “You played your role perfectly, my dear fellow, but he saw right through it, didn’t he?” “Indeed,” mused Tuppence, “he wasn’t fooled. It’s funny how telling the truth never convinces anyone. I learned that today. Shall we grab lunch? Maybe the Savoy?” Tommy smiled.",1
"When Mrs. Vandemeyer turned, she remained motionless. Tuppence felt a sudden pang of fear as she approached the bed. The hand she touched was icy cold - Mrs. Vandemeyer was silent forever. Tuppence's cry drew the others to the room. Within minutes, they confirmed Mrs. Vandemeyer's death, which had likely occurred hours earlier. It appeared she had passed away in her sleep. ""What terrible luck,"" Julius lamented. The lawyer, though calm, had a strange glint in his eyes. ""Luck, you say?"" he questioned. ""It seems utterly impossible that anyone could have gained entry."" ""No,"" the lawyer conceded.",1
"Poirot suspected that the Robinsons were actually Elsa Hardt and her accomplice, using a common name to evade detection. The plan was to lure in their pursuers by offering a flat to a Mrs. Robinson. When the real Mrs. Robinson arrived, they would strike. Poirot, Hastings, and the Italian accomplice managed to capture Elsa Hardt, who revealed the location of the hidden goods. The American Secret Service agent, Mr. Burt, assisted in the arrest. Poirot, recovering from influenza, was ready to resume his detective work. Roger Havering urgently requested Poirot's presence in Derbyshire.",1
"I didn’t believe his idea was very clever, but the jury seemed eager to leave and happy to declare the death an accident instead of suicide. “I find it quite odd,” the coroner remarked, “that the initial doctor did not step forward. His details should have been recorded immediately. It was highly irregular not to do so.” I smirked inwardly. I had my suspicions about the doctor. With that in mind, I decided to pay a visit to Scotland Yard soon. However, the following day held a shock.",1
"The man hesitated, staring at the paper for a few moments before frantically jotting something down. Abruptly, he ceased writing and the pencil slipped from his grasp, clattering to the ground. The doctor retrieved the paper, his expression puzzled. ""Just the number 4 repeated several times, growing in size with each iteration. Perhaps he's attempting to communicate an address, like 14 Farraway Street,"" the doctor mused. ""This is a truly fascinating case. Could you possibly detain him until this afternoon? I must attend to some matters at the hospital, but I will return later to finalize arrangements. We mustn't overlook such an intriguing situation.""",1
"""Of course,"" I muttered weakly. ""You won't breathe a word to anyone about me coming along."" ""Certainly,"" I repeated. Despite my hesitation, having this man by my side might be for the best, though a sense of foreboding lingered. Just as I believed I had found peace! I halted my guest as he made to leave. ""It might be wise to know the name of my new assistant,"" I remarked dryly. He paused, then responded, ""Harry Rayburn suits just fine."" An odd choice of words. ""Agreed,"" I conceded for the third time.",1
"""Excuse me, sir, but was that a usual habit of his?” “No, it was not, however, old Françoise holds the common belief about the English being eccentric and capable of unpredictable actions! While going to fetch her mistress, a younger maid, Léonie, was shocked to find her tied up and gagged, and at the same time, news arrived that M. Renauld’s lifeless body had been found, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most bizarre aspects of the situation. Mr. Poirot, the body was discovered lying face down in an open grave.""",1
"Arriving at the lodge gates, John warned, ""It's quite peaceful around here, Hastings."" ""I actually prefer the quiet,"" I replied. ""It's not bad if you enjoy a leisurely lifestyle. I train with the volunteers and help out on the farms. My wife is always busy working the land. She starts milking at five in the morning and doesn't stop until lunchtime. It's a satisfying life, except for Alfred Inglethorp!"" John abruptly stopped the car, checking his watch.",1
"“Did you ever suspect John Cavendish?” I inquired. “Or was he never on your radar?” “Absolutely not,” she replied. “Even after catching that snippet of conversation between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law, and noticing her evasiveness during the inquest?” “Never.” “Did you not consider the possibilities, and realize that if it wasn't Alfred Inglethorp arguing with his wife - he did vehemently deny it during the inquest - then it had to be either Lawrence or John?”",1
"I observed him carefully, noting his official demeanor as a high-ranking member of the Secret Service. It was evident that he was on a mission to apprehend the elusive figure known as the ""Colonel."" As I pieced together the puzzle in my mind, it became increasingly apparent to me. But where did I fit into this intricate web of deceit and treachery? Were the valuable diamonds the sole motivation behind the relentless pursuit to eliminate me? I could not bring myself to believe it. There was something more at play here, something far greater than a mere heist.",1
"""I would never consider marrying someone unless I was completely in love with them. Women often find joy in doing things they dislike for the one they love. The more stubborn she is, the more satisfaction she finds."" ""I have to disagree with you on that. Usually, it's the other way around,"" he said with a hint of disdain. ""That's exactly it!"" I exclaimed excitedly. ""That's why so many marriages end in unhappiness. It's all the men's fault. They either give in to their wives and end up being despised, or they are selfish, always insisting on their own way without ever showing gratitude.""",1
"Revised text excerpt: ""If she was able to eavesdrop on that, there is no reason she wouldn't have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were careless enough to discuss their plans while seated on the bench. Recall how effortlessly you caught Marthe conversing with Jack Renauld from that very location."" ""But what reason could Marthe possibly have for killing Mr. Renauld?"" I countered. ""What reason? Greed! M. Renauld was a multi-millionaire, and upon his demise (or so she and Jack thought) half of that immense fortune would go to his son. Let's imagine the scenario from Marthe Daubreuil's perspective. ""Marthe Daubreuil listens in on the conversation between Renauld and his wife.""",1
"As I gazed into the distance, I spotted her. ""Psst, mademoiselle! Psst! Just a moment, if you please."" Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly taken aback, hurried over to the hedge at his beckoning. ""May I have a quick chat with you, mademoiselle?"" ""Of course, Monsieur Poirot."" Despite her agreement, her eyes betrayed a sense of unease. ""Do you recall chasing after me on the road when I visited your home with the examining magistrate? You inquired about any suspects in the crime."" ""And you mentioned two Chileans."" Her voice quivered slightly, and her hand instinctively reached for her chest.",1
"I didn't make it to the next evening before I managed to stumble weakly into the adjacent room. The sight of the simple elm coffin, containing the body of one of the most extraordinary men to ever walk this earth, stirred deep emotions within me. Ever since I regained consciousness, my sole focus has been on seeking revenge for Poirot's murder and relentlessly pursuing the Big Four. I had assumed that Ridgeway would share my determination, but to my astonishment, the kind doctor appeared strangely indifferent. His repeated counsel to ""return to South America"" left me puzzled and frustrated.",1
"""After the incident with Sir Eustace, I was left feeling uneasy. His peculiar sense of humor and covert jokes had put me on edge. I knew I had made a mistake by going to Marlow, but it felt natural at the time. Miss Beddingfeld's curiosity only added to my discomfort. When she finally pushed me to reveal my secret, I hesitated. But in three short sentences, I confessed. It was not what she expected. As I walked back to the hotel, a wire arrived, directing me to proceed to Johannesburg. Signed by Harry, not Andy. Sitting down to think, I knew my life was about to change.""",1
"Born in England, he had traveled extensively around the globe. From hunting big game in Africa to living on a ranch in California, he had also conducted business in the South Sea Islands. Serving as a secretary to a prominent railway tycoon in New York, he even spent time with a hospitable Arab tribe in the desert. With precision, he identified M. Hautet. ""Are you the investigating judge on this case? A pleasure to make your acquaintance, M. le juge. This situation is truly distressing. How is Mrs. Renauld holding up? Is she managing to cope with the ordeal? It must have been a tremendous shock for her.""",1
"As Lord Yardly and I stood in the dimly lit room, a sudden darkness enveloped us. The sound of a door slamming echoed through the silence, followed by a chilling scream that sent shivers down our spines. ""Maude!"" Lord Yardly exclaimed, his voice filled with fear. Panic set in as we fumbled in the dark, attempting to reach the source of the disturbance. Finally, we located the door and flung it open. The scene before us was horrifying - Lady Yardly lay motionless on the cold floor, a red mark marring her pale throat where her necklace had been violently torn away. Unsure if she was alive or dead, we hovered over her, waiting for any sign of life. Slowly, her eyes fluttered open, revealing the fear and pain hidden within.",1
"Tuppence hurriedly scribbled a note to Mr. Carter, detailing Tommy's whereabouts and pleading for help in tracking him down. The mere thought of Carter's assistance lifted her mood, and she eagerly inquired about Julius Hersheimmer. The response came swiftly - Julius had returned recently but left again without delay. Tuppence felt a surge of hope at the prospect of seeing Julius, hoping he might have a solution for locating Tommy. As she penned the note in Julius's sitting room, the door suddenly flung open.",1
"However, the conversation shifted when the topic of jewels arose. Mrs. Blair and Miss Beddingfeld both turned to Colonel Race with excitement, exclaiming ""Diamonds!"" in unison. They bombarded Race with questions about his experiences in Kimberley, eager to learn more about the mines and the treatment of the native workers. Despite my own visit to Kimberley, I found myself unable to join in the conversation as Race expertly fielded their inquiries.",1
"""Very well! That's all I needed to know. Much obliged."" Annie nervously chuckled and left the room. My excitement couldn't be contained. ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""I must say, this is a remarkable discovery."" ""What discovery?"" Poirot inquired. ""The fact that it was the cocoa, not the coffee, that was poisoned. It all makes sense now! The effects were delayed until the early morning because the cocoa was consumed in the dead of night."" ""So you believe that the cocoa - remember what I told you, Hastings - was laced with strychnine?"" ""Absolutely! That white powder on the tray, what else could it be?"" Poirot calmly responded, ""It could have been salt.""",1
"""Ah!” Poirot observed her intently. “Miss Howard, I have just one question for you. Please, answer truthfully.” “I never lie,” Miss Howard responded. “Here it is. Do you still maintain that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?” “What are you implying?” she questioned sharply. “Your charming explanations won’t sway me at all. I will concede that he didn’t purchase strychnine at the pharmacy. So what? Perhaps he soaked fly paper, as I mentioned from the start.” “That would be arsenic, not strychnine,” Poirot pointed out calmly.",1
"I had just returned to Europe after spending over a year on a ranch in Argentina. As the familiar shore came into view, memories of my time in South America flooded back. Despite the success my wife and I had found there, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease as I traveled to London. In just a few months, I would be reunited with an old friend, Hercule Poirot. My plan was to surprise him, catching the little man with an egg-shaped head and green eyes off guard.",1
"""And when the moment arrived, my little coup de théâtre was all set!"" ""You're truly amazing, Poirot; absolutely amazing!"" ""I was happy to do it, as well. I had a great admiration for the countess. It would have been a shame if she had died in the explosion."" ""I've been hesitant to ask about the Big Four."" ""All the bodies have been found now. Number Four's body was completely unrecognizable, the head shattered. I wish, I rather wish it wasn't so. I wanted to be certain but let's not dwell on that. Take a look at this."" He passed me a newspaper with a marked paragraph.",1
"“He was a marvelous little chap. He always claimed that successful detective work boiled down to method. While my approach was inspired by his, I have certainly taken it to new heights. He was a peculiar individual, quite the fashionable man, yet incredibly astute.” “I enjoy a well-crafted mystery myself,” commented Miss Howard. “Although, there is a lot of rubbish out there. The culprit revealed in the final chapter. “There are numerous unsolved crimes,” I countered. “Not by the authorities, but by those intimately involved. The ones closest to the situation. You can’t easily deceive them. They would see through it.”",1
"“You think she intentionally returned?” “That appears to be the case, sir. She ascended the stairs as I was opening the door.” “Hm, so she must be associated with the group; however, as a woman, she likely didn’t want to witness harm come to a young man. Nonetheless, her actions suggest she is involved with them.” “I struggle to believe she is truly part of their organization, sir. She appeared quite unique.” “Attractive, I assume?” Mr. Carter inquired, his grin causing Tommy to redden. He reluctantly acknowledged Annette’s beauty.",1
"A person locked away in a mental institution can sometimes lose their sanity, they say. It was as if I was living in a daze. Pretending to be someone else had become my reality. Eventually, I stopped feeling anything at all. Time passed by in a blur. ""But then, everything started to shift. Mrs. Vandemeyer arrived from the city. She and the physician probed me with questions, tried different therapies. The idea of being sent to a specialist in Paris was mentioned. But they ultimately decided against it. I caught wind of conversations hinting that my loved ones were searching for me.",1
"“I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again.",1
"""However, she found solace in his lack of dismissal towards her fears. Surprisingly, I had never imagined Poirot to possess such a strong belief in superstitions. Bringing up the topic on our way back, his demeanor was serious. 'Indeed, Hastings. I have faith in these matters. Superstition holds significant power.' 'So, what's our next move?' 'Always practical, dear Hastings! Well, first things first, we will send a cable to New York for more information on the death of young Mr. Bleibner.' With that, he promptly dispatched the cable. The response was detailed and to the point, revealing that young Rupert Bleibner had been struggling for years.""",1
"Poirot shot me a scathing look. ""My dear Hastings, what a brilliant mind you possess!"" he sneered. ""Don't you understand that I have expressly forbidden such a loaf - a loaf so haphazard and misshapen that no self-respecting baker would dare to bake it!"" Trying to change the subject, I asked casually, ""Anything noteworthy in the mail today?"" Poirot shook his head in disappointment. ""I have yet to peruse my correspondence, but these days nothing of significance ever seems to arrive. The masterminds, the methodical criminals, they are simply nonexistent. The recent cases I have taken on have been utterly mundane.""",1
"Poirot and Japp were discussing the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Davenheim. The conversation turned to the possibility of Mr. Davenheim hiding in plain sight, with Poirot suggesting that he might be hiding in a prison. This revelation shocked both Japp and Hastings, as they realized that Mr. Davenheim's clever plan involved creating a false identity as Billy Kellett to throw off the police. It was a brilliant scheme that kept everyone fooled until Poirot saw through the disguise.",1
"""You won't forget the names, will you?"" Albert repeated smoothly. ""You trust me, miss, it'll all work out. But what about you? Aren't you scared to rely on her?"" ""No, no, that's fine. But hurry and make the call."" With a deep sigh, Tuppence stepped into the Mansions and hurried to the entrance of No. 20. She wasn't sure how she would keep Mrs. Vandemeyer occupied until the two men showed up, but she knew it had to be done, and she had to do it alone. What had prompted this sudden departure? Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect something? Speculations were pointless. Tuppence rang the bell confidently.",1
"Then, in a sudden burst of blue flame and a deafening crash, my world plunged into darkness. When I finally regained consciousness, the first thing I saw was the comforting presence of Dr. Ridgeway standing over me. A look of relief washed over his face as he reassured me to stay calm. ""Don't worry,"" he said softly, ""you're safe. There has been an incident."" Panic gripped me as I whispered, ""Poirot?"" Dr. Ridgeway's eyes met mine, and with a solemn expression, he revealed the truth I dreaded to hear about our dear friend Poirot.",1
"As I strolled through the expansive villa, surrounded by rows of captivating books and picturesque landscapes, I couldn't help but feel restless at the stagnant pace of our days. Poirot, on the other hand, seemed perfectly content with the tranquility that enveloped us. Our peaceful routine remained undisturbed until one fateful morning in late June. The unexpected arrival of a car disrupted our quiet reverie, prompting me to hasten downstairs in search of answers. There, I discovered Poirot engaged in conversation with a charming young man, not much older than myself. He proceeded to make the introductions.",1
"In the hallway, Giraud stood facing his captive. ""Good afternoon, M. Giraud,"" Poirot greeted. Giraud pointed towards Jack. ""He tried to escape, but I caught him. He's being held for his father's murder."" Poirot turned to Jack, who stood against the wall, pale and silent. ""What do you have to say for yourself?"" Jack remained silent. I was shocked. I had hoped for a denial, but Jack's silence was damning. Poirot questioned Giraud's reasons for the arrest. As they entered the salon, Giraud boasted about his detective skills. Poirot listened attentively, then pointed out a flaw in Giraud's theory. Intrigued, I followed Poirot out of the room. As they emerged, Mrs. Renauld appeared on the stairs, shocked to see her son in custody.",1
"We returned to the bridge, followed by a woman burdened with all the household items stacked precariously on her head, including a frying pan. Suzanne regretted not having her camera, but Colonel Race assured her that opportunities would arise. As we reached the bridge, Colonel Race proposed exploring the rainbow forest, questioning whether we were afraid of getting wet. Suzanne and I agreed to join him, while Sir Eustace headed back to the hotel. However, the rainbow forest did not meet my expectations.",1
"""This is Captain Harvey,"" said Poirot, ""one of the most famous members of your Intelligence Service."" ""Not famous at all,"" replied the young man with a laugh. ""Not famous except to those in the know. Most of Captain Harvey's friends and acquaintances see him as an amiable but brainless young man, only interested in fox trots or whatever the latest dance craze may be."" Poirot and I shared a chuckle. ""Well, well, time for business,"" Poirot continued. ""You believe the time has come, then?"" ""Absolutely, sir.",1
"""Friday, we're headed to Yardly Chase to visit Lord and Lady Yardly,"" she said, stirring a faint memory in my mind. There was a scandal a few years back involving their trip to the States. Lord Yardly was rumored to have indulged in wild escapades with some ladies, but there was more to it. Whispers connected Lady Yardly to a Hollywood star - Gregory B. Rolf. Miss Marvell leaned in, ""I have a secret to share, Monsieur Poirot,"" she whispered.",1
""" The letter, penned by Tuppence's familiar hand, read: ""DEAR JULIUS, ""It's essential to clarify things. I can't consider marriage until we find Tommy. Let's postpone that discussion. ""With warm regards, ""TUPPENCE."" Tommy returned the letter, a glint in his eyes. His emotions had shifted drastically. He now viewed Tuppence as a paragon of virtue and selflessness. After all, hadn't she turned down Julius without a second thought? Admittedly, the letter hinted at wavering, but he was willing to overlook that.",1
"""Absolutely not,"" I stated firmly. ""My great-aunt Jane always used to claim that a true lady remains unfazed by any event,"" I whispered wistfully. ""I strive to embody her teachings."" Observing Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew's thoughts written plainly on his countenance, I felt compelled to continue speaking. ""Your skill in disguise is truly remarkable,"" I complimented sincerely. ""Throughout your time as Miss Pettigrew, I never once suspected, not even when you dropped your pencil in astonishment at my appearance on the train in Cape Town."" He drummed his fingers on the desk with the pencil clutched in his hand.",1
"Poirot's conversation with the doctor turned to the ancient beliefs of Egypt, causing tension among the group. Despite the doctor's skepticism, Poirot's interest in the supernatural was evident. As they explored the excavations, a sense of unease lingered in the air. Hassan, a servant, warned Poirot of evil spirits present and urged the young master to leave. The sighting of a shadowy figure resembling Anubis, the god of departing souls, heightened the group's fear. Dr. Ames and Sir Guy attempted to catch the mysterious figure but found no trace of its existence. Poirot, unfazed by the events, focused on ensuring his safety in his own unique way.",1
"I couldn't shake off the final words of Mrs. Inglethorp. What secrets did they hold? What revelations were lost with her untimely death? The doctors finally made their way down the stairs, Dr. Wilkins brimming with importance and barely contained excitement. Dr. Bauerstein, on the other hand, remained stoic in the shadows, his expression unreadable. It was Dr. Wilkins who spoke up, turning to John with a request: ""Mr. Cavendish, we require your permission for an autopsy."" John's response was solemn, a tinge of pain flickering across his features as he asked, ""Is it truly necessary?""",1
"""The Russian's face remained expressionless, a mask of fear. ""But why did they release us?"" questioned Tuppence, her eyes narrowing with suspicion. ""I imagine Monsieur Kramenin's charm had something to do with it,"" suggested Julius with a sly grin. The Russian could no longer contain his emotions. ""Damn you, damn you! They now know I double-crossed them. I won't last long in this country."" ""Agreed,"" nodded Julius. ""I suggest you flee to Russia immediately."" ""Then let me leave,"" pleaded the Russian. ""I have fulfilled my end of the bargain.""",1
"Poirot examined it closely before removing it from the lock. The words ""Key to Roll Top Desk"" were scribbled on it in messy handwriting, a stark contrast to the tidy writing on the other keys. ""This is unfamiliar,"" Poirot remarked with a furrowed brow. ""I would wager that this does not belong to Mr. Marsh. But who else has been inside the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I am not mistaken, is a young woman of precision and organization."" At that moment, Baker entered the room in response to the bell. ""Could you please bring madame your wife and assist with some inquiries?"" Baker left and quickly returned with Mrs.",1
"""I've heard tales of master criminals before, but never encountered one in person. You're familiar with Captain Kent's account. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"" ""Indeed, my dear friend. Kindly provide me with Mrs. Halliday's contact information and a brief introduction, if you would be so kind."" And so it happened that the next day we set off for Chetwynd Lodge, located near the small town of Chobham in Surrey. Mrs. Halliday welcomed us immediately, a tall, blonde woman, displaying signs of nervousness and excitement. Accompanying her was her young daughter, a charming five-year-old. Poirot clarified the reason for our visit.",1
"""That would be four, correct? He may believe they are conspiring against him."" ""Indeed, indeed,"" Poirot replied in a distracted tone. ""What about meals? Have you taken any measures in that regard?"" ""I try my best. However, there are times when Mrs. Templeton insists on serving him his meals herself, and times when I am not present."" ""I see. And you are not confident enough to involve the authorities?"" The nurse's expression revealed her shock at the mere suggestion. ""What I have personally done, M. Poirot, is this. Mr. Templeton suffered a severe episode after consuming a bowl of soup.""",1
"""Listen to your elders without interruption. I have a proposal for you. Your life in exchange for the diamonds. Understand that your life is completely under my control."" ""And what about Harry?"" ""I am too compassionate to separate young lovers. He will be released as well, with the condition that neither of you will interfere with me in the future."" ""How can I trust that you will uphold your end of the deal?"" ""You have no guarantee, my dear. You must have faith in me and hope for the best. Unless, of course, you are feeling heroic and would prefer annihilation, which is a different story.""",1
"""Baker was sent to the neighboring town to get two printed will-forms by Mr. Marsh. They signed one, but he made a mistake and had them sign again later that day. After signing the second time, Mr. Marsh went out to pay tradesmen's books. There were workmen from a Plymouth firm who had been in the house two years ago for repairs, but they couldn't remember the details. Poirot suspected a second will and a hiding place, so they decided to go to Plymouth to investigate further.""",1
"""She never speaks of her past, or even mentions her husband. It is unclear whether he is alive or dead. There is an air of mystery surrounding her,"" I acknowledged, feeling my curiosity piqued. ""And the daughter?"" I inquired. ""A remarkably beautiful young woman, humble, religious, everything one could hope for. One can't help but feel sorry for her, because even if she is unaware of the past, any man seeking her hand in marriage would inevitably uncover the truth, and then..."" The detective shrugged dismissively. ""But it wouldn't be her fault!"" I protested, my anger mounting. ""No.""",1
"""So all the acquaintances and supporters of the great Monsieur Hercule Poirot will be in mourning. However, no amount of sorrow can reverse the hands of time."" ""Expressed quite elegantly,"" remarked Poirot, inclining his head. ""And what if I were to agree?"" ""In that scenario, I am authorized to provide you with reparation."" He removed a wallet from his pocket, and tossed ten banknotes onto the surface. They were valued at ten thousand francs each. ""This is just to demonstrate our sincerity,"" he explained. ""You will receive ten times that sum."" ""Heavens above,"" I exclaimed, jumping to my feet, ""the audacity of your assumption!"" ""Please remain seated, Hastings,"" commanded Poirot in his authoritative tone.",1
"Jack barely caught his train in Paris after rushing from the library to retrieve his forgotten bag. Out of breath and angry, his face flushed with color, he narrowly made it in time. A dispute that left him fuming was overheard, but the details were lost in the chaos of yelling voices. Poirot, unruffled by the commotion, chose to wait in the cool salon for the return of the examining magistrate. Meanwhile, I decided to investigate on my own and stumbled upon Cinderella, who was unexpectedly nosing around the crime scene. Her morbid curiosity about the murder at the Villa Geneviève both intrigued and repulsed me. I couldn't help but wonder what the world was coming to, with women like her seeking thrills from such gruesome events.",1
"""If only you understood how deceptively simple it is to accidentally poison someone, you wouldn't find it amusing. Come, let's enjoy some tea. We have a variety of hidden treasures in that cabinet. No, Lawrence, that's the poison cabinet. The large cabinet, that's correct."" We had a delightful tea time, lending Cynthia a hand with the dishes afterwards. Just as we finished putting away the final teaspoon, a knock echoed at the door. Cynthia and Nibs' faces immediately turned to stone, adopting a serious and unwelcoming demeanor. ""Enter,"" Cynthia commanded, her voice sharp and authoritative.",1
"""Absolutely,"" Poirot mused, setting down the brush. ""It is crucial not to let oneself become fixated on a single idea. I have found myself teetering on the brink of that trap. Imagine, my dear friend, that even in this instance, I am on the verge of falling into it. Those two marks you pointed out, a downward stroke and a line intersecting it, could they not be interpreted as the start of a 4?"" ""Oh, Poirot, you jest,"" I exclaimed, chuckling. ""It's preposterous! I detect the influence of the Big Four in every corner. It is wise to exercise one's intellect in a completely different environment. Look! Japp is approaching us.""",1
"""Never one to pay attention to legs, he would sooner die than admit it. He finds my fascination with such matters frivolous. Enjoying irritating Pagett, I added with malice: “Since you've met her, why not invite her to join us for dinner tomorrow night at the Fancy Dress dance. And don't forget to pick out a fancy costume for me at the barber.” “You wouldn't actually attend in fancy dress, would you?” Pagett exclaimed, horrified. It was clear that such behavior didn't align with his perception of my dignity. He appeared shocked and dismayed.""",1
"""And have you ever crossed paths with Li Chang Yen?""   ""Before M. Poirot approached me, I believed I was the sole individual in England who had. Let me be clear, M. Desjardeaux, in China today, Li Chang Yen is the only man of importance. He may, and I stress may, possess the most brilliant mind in the world currently.""   M. Desjardeaux appeared dazed for a moment. However, he quickly composed himself.   ""There could be merit to your words, M. Poirot,"" he retorted icily. ""But when it comes to Madame Olivier, you are unequivocally mistaken.""",1
"“Never have I loved you like this!” Her lips softly grazed my cheek before finding mine, showering me with kisses filled with a passion that seemed unreal. The intensity of the moment, the sheer astonishment of it, will be etched in my memory forever. A noise from the doorway interrupted us, causing us to glance up. Poirot stood there, watching us intently. Without a second thought, I sprang towards him and restrained his arms. ""Hurry,"" I whispered to the woman. ""Leave now. Run as fast as you can. I'll handle him."" With a swift glance in my direction, she dashed out of the room. I held Poirot firmly, not letting him budge. ""My friend,"" remarked Poirot calmly, ""you are quite skilled at this type of thing.""",1
"""New York!"" ""Lucy,"" I replied, ""soon you'll be tired of California and excitement."" ""I could use a fancy new pair of shoes,"" Lucy confessed longingly. ""Should I join you to see Jack Thompson tomorrow?"" ""I'd rather go by myself. He's more comfortable talking one-on-one,"" I explained. And that's how I found myself outside the cafe the next day, wrestling with an uncooperative umbrella that just wouldn't open, while Lucy lounged on the sofa with a magazine and a cup of tea.",1
"The man referred to as Number One had been ousted from the group. ""Feeling better?"" inquired the German, taking away the now empty glass. ""Much obliged,"" Tommy replied with a grin. ""Ah, my dear boy, your thick skull has served you well. Conrad packed quite a punch."" He gestured towards the sinister doorkeeper with a nod. Conrad chuckled. Tommy strained to turn his head. ""Ah, so you're Conrad,"" he remarked. ""Seems my sturdy skull did you a favor as well. Looking at you, I almost regret sparing you from the noose."" Conrad growled, while the bearded man interjected calmly: ""He was never in any danger of that.""",1
"As the night drew to a close, I managed to convince her to let me walk her to the edge of town. We retraced our path, passing by the cemetery once more before veering off onto a different road. When we reached the first row of shops, she paused and extended her hand. ""Thank you for coming with me,"" she said. ""Are you sure you'll be alright now?"" I inquired. ""Yes, I'll be fine. I hope you won't face any repercussions for showing me around,"" she replied. I assured her that it was not a concern. ""Well then, goodbye."" ""Au revoir,"" I interjected. ""If you're sticking around, we'll cross paths once more.""",1
"""If Miss Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against Alfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions, which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.” He paused a minute, then went on. “Now, to my way of thinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard’s being the murderess.""",1
"""I have uncovered the truth,"" she declared confidently. ""You were not in Cannes on January 8th as you claimed, but rather in Marlow. And when Madame Nadina betrayed you, you conspired to eliminate her. The evidence points directly to you as the culprit behind the crime."" Sir Eustace raised an eyebrow. ""And who is your source for these accusations? The man currently evading the police? His testimony will surely not hold up in court."" She smirked. ""We have corroborating evidence. Someone else knew of Nadina's meeting with you at the Mill House."" Sir Eustace's expression shifted, betraying his surprise.",1
"""He arrived back at the hotel around eleven o'clock and headed straight to his room, checking for any mail on the way. The next day, he exited the hotel and vanished without a trace."" ""When did he depart the hotel? Could it have been his usual time to head to Professor Bourgoneau's lab?"" ""It's a mystery. No one noticed him leaving. However, the absence of breakfast suggests he left early."" ""Alternatively, he may have slipped out again after returning the night before?"" ""Doubtful. His bed showed signs of use, and the night porter would have noticed anyone leaving at that time.",1
"” Adventuresses should never be too rigid in their approaches. The plan succeeded. A servant in powdered wig accepted the card and took it away. Soon a timid secretary showed up. I engaged in a verbal sparring match with him and emerged victorious. He left in defeat. Shortly after, he returned and implored me to follow him. I complied. I found myself in a spacious chamber, a frightened shorthand typist hurried past me as if a ghostly apparition. The door closed behind me, leaving me alone with Lord Nasby. A formidable figure. Large head. Broad face. Thick moustache. Stout belly. I composed myself. I had not intended to focus on Lord Nasby's physique. He was already shouting at me.”",1
"""And yet, had my keen eyes not caught sight of him, Hercule Poirot may have met his demise, a calamity for all. And you, my friend, though not a national tragedy."" ""Thank you,"" I replied coolly. ""So, what's the plan?"" ""Plan?"" exclaimed Poirot. ""We must think. Yes, now is the time to use our little grey cells. This M. Halliday, was he truly in Paris? Yes, Professor Bourgoneau, who knows him, confirmed seeing and speaking with him."" ""What exactly are you suggesting?"" I asked. ""That was on Friday morning.",1
"A sense of overwhelming dread seemed to be prevailing; the man's face contorted in fear. ""The bringer of destruction,"" he muttered. Then, succumbing to a sudden spasm, he collapsed in a faint. ""Dear God,"" Poirot murmured, ""I was correct after all. I was right."" ""Do you believe so?"" He cut in. ""Bring him to the bed in my chamber. Time is of the essence if I am to make my train. Not that I desire to make it. Oh, if only I could miss it without guilt! But I have given my word. Let us go, Hastings!"" Entrusting our enigmatic guest to Mrs. Pearson, we departed, narrowly catching our train by a hair's breadth.",1
"""Our foes need to be convinced that we are headed back to England, and that won't happen unless they witness us boarding the train and departing."" ""Are we planning to sneak away at the last second?"" ""No, Hastings. Our adversaries won't settle for anything less than a genuine departure."" ""But the train doesn't make any stops until Calais?"" ""It will make a stop if the right price is paid."" ""Oh, come on, Poirot, you can't possibly bribe an express train to stop, they would never agree."" ""My dear Hastings, have you ever noticed the small lever for the signal d'arrêt fine for misuse, I believe it's 100 francs?"" ""You're planning to use that?"" ""Actually, a friend of mine, Pierre Combeau, will take care of it.""",1
"""The evidence in both cases clearly points to the same conclusion."" ""So, you're suggesting that Madame Beroldy escaped justice? That she was, in fact, involved in her husband's murder?"" I gazed at him in disbelief. ""Absolutely! Don't you agree?"" Poirot paced to the far end of the room, absentmindedly adjusting a chair before speaking slowly. ""Indeed, that is my belief. However, it's not a certainty, my dear friend. Legally speaking, Madame Beroldy is not guilty."" ""Of that specific crime, maybe. But not of others.""",1
"“The voice on the phone was desperate. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor, they’ve killed me!’ Then it faded, leaving me shaken. ‘Who is this?’ I asked. ‘Who is this?’ A faint whisper replied, ‘Foscatine, Regent’s Court.’” The doctor gasped. “Count Foscatini! He lives in Regent’s Court. I must hurry. What could have transpired?” Poirot inquired, “One of your patients?” The doctor nodded, “I treated him recently for a minor ailment. An Italian, fluent in English.”",1
"""It’s largely thanks to him and his generous donations that this project is progressing. He even influenced the design of it."" Poirot nodded in contemplation. Then he stated, ""The location chosen to bury the body was not ideal, was it? If the men had started digging, everything would have been uncovered."" ""Precisely,"" Giraud exclaimed in triumph. ""That indicates they were unfamiliar with the area. It's a strong form of circumstantial evidence."" ""Indeed,"" Poirot responded with uncertainty. ""No one familiar with the area would bury a body there unless they intended for it to be found.""",1
"""Marthe Daubreuil's beauty was undeniable, captivating Jack effortlessly. Despite his lingering attachment to another woman, his loyalty to Marthe remained unshaken. It was clear that once he discovered the truth, his feelings would turn to disgust. As for Giraud, his nerves got the best of him and he had to retreat back to Paris. Poirot's prediction proved to be accurate when Jack was finally ready to face reality, with Poirot guiding him through the harsh truth.""",1
"He concealed his thoughts so cleverly behind those impenetrable dark eyes. He unnerved me a bit. He had always unnerved me. I never could figure him out. We silently ascended until we arrived at the location where Rhodes is protected by massive rocks. A peculiar, eerie location, far from civilization, that sings an endless song of rugged magnificence. We lingered there for a while in quietude. Then descended once again, but veering slightly from the trail. At times it was a difficult climb and at one point we encountered a steep incline or cliff that was nearly vertical. Colonel Race led the way, then offered a hand to assist me.",1
"""Always I made sure of it myself."" ""And last evening?"" ""I secured it just like always."" ""You are certain of that?"" ""I vow it by the saints, sir."" ""What time was that?""

Monsieur was still in his study."" ""So, if anyone unlocked the door later, it must have been M. Renauld himself?"" Françoise simply shrugged.",1
"""I noticed the letters were not delivered by post,"" she remarked. ""No, they were hand-delivered by a Chinaman. It's unsettling,"" he replied.“Why is that?”""Because Gregory purchased the stone from a Chinese man in San Francisco three years back.""“So, you suspect the diamond in question is ‘The Western Star’?” she inquired.“Yes, that's correct. Gregory recalls there was a mysterious tale linked to the stone, but the Chinese man refused to share any details. He appeared terrified and eager to part with it,” he explained.",1
"I sensed Harry's gaze before he even spoke. ""You resemble a witch, Anne,"" he finally uttered, his tone carrying an unfamiliar weight. His hand extended, barely brushing my hair, sending a shiver down my spine. Abruptly, he stood up with a curse. ""You need to depart by tomorrow, do you understand?"" he exclaimed. ""I can't endure this any longer. I am merely human. You have to go, Anne. It's imperative. You're no simpleton. Deep down, you realize this is unsustainable."" ""I guess not,"" I replied, deliberating each word.",1
"'Curious about my presence in your garden?' he inquired. 'An explanation is warranted,' came the response. 'I must clarify, the spoons were not my target.' A grin appeared. 'Your initial assumption, incorrect. My intentions shifted. By the way, you're American, correct?' After sharing my name, I inquired about his identity. 'I am Dr. Hall, owner of this private nursing facility.' Unaware of this fact, I kept it to myself. Grateful for the insight, I trusted him but held back the full truth.",1
"""Is there any connection between the four that we are missing?"" ""I'm not following."" ""Let me be direct. Did those four men do anything that could be seen as disrespectful to Men-her-Ra?"" The doctor stared at Poirot in disbelief. ""You can't be serious, Monsieur Poirot. You're not actually buying into that nonsense, are you?"" Willard was growing frustrated. Poirot, with his green cat-like eyes, remained calm and unmoving. ""So you don't believe it, doctor?"" ""Absolutely not. I trust in science, not superstition,"" the doctor stated firmly.",1
"But the suffering of the heart, monsieur, does it not weigh heavily? Day after day, I witnessed Madame's gradual decline in health. She was a mere shadow of the woman who had first graced our presence a month earlier. Monsieur, too, was not immune to change. His demeanor hinted at deep-seated troubles, teetering on the edge of a nerve-wracking crisis. And who could blame him, given the scandalous nature of the affair? No sense of discretion or restraint. Certainly not the English way!” My blood boiled at the injustice, yet the magistrate pressed on with his interrogation, unwavering in his pursuit of the truth. “You claim that M.",1

Poirot shifted his gaze to John. “If you permit me to summon your groundskeeper, I will substantiate my claim.” “Certainly, but I fail to see ” Poirot gestured to silence him. “Just heed my request.

"""Unbelievable,"" whispered the Frenchman. ""Ryland involved in something like that? It seems too absurd."" ""Allow me to share with you some of the exploits of this notorious Big Four."" Poirot's storytelling was captivating. Even though I was familiar with every detail, the recounting of our adventures and narrow escapes sent shivers down my spine once again. M. Desjardeaux gazed silently at Mr. Crowther as Poirot concluded. The latter responded to the unspoken question. ""Indeed, M. Desjardeaux, it appears that the 'Big Four' is a reality. Initially mocked by Scotland Yard, they have now been forced to acknowledge the truth of the matter.""",1
"""I prayed fervently that we would never be under her control again. Shortly after, we found ourselves outside the mansion, quickly making our way through the garden.

Just as all hope seemed lost, I emerge at the last moment, instilling chaos and securing victory in a way that is entirely my own!"" It dawned on me that Poirot possessed a vanity that was unyielding, impervious to any challenge. I pointed out that on a few occasions, our opponents had bested us.

The doctor's name was displayed on a brass plate attached to the gate. As we walked up the path and rang the bell, luck was on our side. We caught Dr. Bernard during his consulting hour, with no patients in queue at that moment. Dr. Bernard, an elderly man with a slight stoop and genial demeanor, welcomed us. Poirot, introducing himself, outlined the purpose of our visit, emphasizing the necessity for Insurance Companies to conduct a thorough investigation in such cases.""",1
"The man's impeccable appearance was truly remarkable. It seemed that even a tiny speck of dust would disturb him more than a gunshot wound. Despite his dandy and now limping demeanor, he had once been a highly esteemed figure in the Belgian police force, known for his exceptional detective skills and success in solving complex cases. He showed me the modest home he shared with his Belgian colleagues, inviting me to visit him soon.",1
"Beresford was tasked by the British Government to recover the documents. Sir James Peel Edgerton, an influential English Member of Parliament, played a key role in uncovering your whereabouts. Now, please proceed with sharing the full story. Did Danvers entrust you with the documents?"" ""Yes, he believed I could safeguard them, prioritizing the safety of women and children,"" I replied. ""Exactly as we suspected,"" noted Sir James. ""He emphasized their critical importance, suggesting they could significantly impact the Allies' efforts.""",1
"“Last time we met,” I began, “you were walking back with your sister, such a well-behaved child. Speaking of which, how is she doing?” A gleaming smile was my answer. “Thank you for asking! My sister is in good health.” “Is she accompanying you today?” “No,” the minx replied haughtily. “She decided to stay in town.” I chuckled. “I highly doubt you even have a sister. And if you do, her name must be Harris!” “Do you recall mine?” she inquired, a smirk playing on her lips. “Cinderella. But now you'll reveal your true name, won't you?” She shook her head mischievously. “Not even for why you're here?” “Ah, that! I assume you've heard about individuals in my line of work taking a break.”",1
"I turned away in disgust at the girl's ghoulish excitement. It made me wonder about the modern woman's obsession with morbid sensation. Despite her beauty, I couldn't shake my disapproval. The lady challenged me, saying women are no longer the delicate creatures of the past. She convinced me to show her around, hinting at the possibility of a big scoop for the papers. I hesitated, but her soft hand in mine was my undoing. We went first to where the body was found, then cautiously approached the Villa. I led her to the back where the shed was located, hoping to avoid any unwanted encounters. I left her hidden in the shrubbery as I entered the house, the voices inside growing louder.",1
"""Are you still intent on keeping me around?"" ""I have no desire for your companionship. You're free to leave at any time. I assumed you'd prefer a ride back to London."" ""You may never even make it to London,"" growled the other. ""Release me here and now."" ""Of course. Stop the car, George. This gentleman won't be returning with us. If I ever visit Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I'll be expecting a warm reception, and..."" But Julius was cut off mid-sentence, and as the car came to a stop, the Russian had already jumped out and vanished into the darkness. ""Quite eager to part ways with us,"" remarked Julius, as the car resumed its journey.",1
"Suzanne and I were strategizing about our targets. Mr. Chichester heading to Durban, Sir Eustace to Cape Town and then Rhodesia. Colonel Race was also on his way to Rhodesia. The plan was to keep an eye on them all. However, danger struck when I was attacked on deck. My mysterious rescuer turned out to be the man with the scar. Another shadow joined in, revealing the identity of my assailant - Guy Pagett. The discovery left us all stunned. Suspicion hung heavy in the air, with secrets waiting to be revealed.",1
"Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.” Black was straightforward enough over the matter. “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what” “What has it got to do with Mr.",1
"""It wasn’t merely the monetary worth of the discovery that captivated them, Eardsley had wealth in his future and Lucas was accustomed to poverty. Rather, it was the pure joy of finding something new.” There was a brief silence before he continued, almost hesitantly: “I hope you don’t object to me recounting the story in this manner, almost as if I wasn’t a part of it. That’s how it feels now, reflecting on those two youngsters. It’s easy to overlook the fact that one of them happened to be Harry Rayburn.""",1
"“Clearly, this man is extremely wealthy,” remarked the other person with a calculating look. “I suggest you meet with him, Ivan. Discover his intentions.” The secretary followed orders, quietly shutting the door behind him. After a short time, he came back. “He refuses to disclose his reasons, insisting it is of a personal nature and he must speak with you.” “A man of considerable wealth,” whispered Kramenin. “Escort him up, dear Ivan.” Once again, the secretary exited the room and returned with Julius in tow. “Are you Mr. Kramenin?” Julius asked abruptly. The Russian, fixing his venomous gaze on him, nodded. “Nice to make your acquaintance,” the American replied.",1
"""I must have made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: “Oh, yes, he did! Not that it matters now now that we’ve come to the parting of the ways.”   “What do you mean?”   She answered quietly: “I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.”   “You and John are not going to live here?”   “John may live here, but I shall not.”   “You are going to leave him?”   “Yes.”   “But why?”   She paused a long time, and said at last: “Perhaps because I want to be free!”   And, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of vast open plains, uncharted territories, undiscovered worlds and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. ”",1
"Vandemeyer was about to leave the country, and the staff had already departed. Sir James and his companions had visited her when she fell ill, choosing to stay the night with her. Did they have any knowledge of family members? No, but Sir James directed him to Mrs. Vandemeyer's lawyer. A nurse came soon after to care for her, while the rest departed the ominous premises. ""What's next?"" Julius inquired, a sense of hopelessness in his demeanor. ""I suppose we're finished for good,"" Sir James pondered, stroking his chin contemplatively.",1
"In a matter of minutes, the petite physician hurried over to them. ""Dr. Hall, could you spare a moment?"" Sir James inquired cheerfully. ""Allow me to introduce you to Miss Cowley. And Mr. Hersheimmer, I believe you are already acquainted."" The doctor greeted Julius with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. ""Ah, yes, the young man from the tree incident! How is the ankle?"" ""Thanks to your expert care, doc, it's as good as new,"" Julius replied. ""And the heart condition? Ha ha!"" ""Still unresolved,"" Julius stated shortly. ""To be direct, could we speak with you in private?"" Sir James requested. ""Of course.""",1
"I can only speculate on what prompted this abrupt shift in attitude. My hypothesis, however, is that Mrs. Inglethorp's sudden need for stamps played a crucial role. Initially lacking any stamps in her own desk, she requested Dorcas to retrieve some. With her husband's desk securely locked in the opposite corner of the room, she felt compelled to search for stamps and attempted to use her own keys to unlock it. It is my belief that one of her keys did indeed unlock the desk.",1
"No one answered the doorbell. They pressed it repeatedly, but the house remained eerily quiet. After circling the perimeter, they found all the windows tightly closed. Based on what they saw, the house seemed deserted. ""Looks like a dead end,"" Julius remarked. Slowly, they made their way back to the entrance. ""There should be a nearby village,"" the young American suggested. ""Let's ask around there. Surely someone will have information about this place and if it's been occupied recently."" ""Agreed, let's do that."" Walking up the road, they soon reached a small cluster of houses.",1
"I wonder about this Chichester character who seems so innocent. Perhaps Pagett will have some insight. He always seems to know everything. The evening was quite eventful, with Mrs. Blair's refusal to dress up and Race's sudden chattiness after some champagne. I danced with various ladies, including Anne Beddingfeld, who looked stunning in her gipsy costume. As the night went on, I shared some entertaining lion stories, much to the amusement of the guests. It was a delightful evening, despite Pagett's absence and Reeves' presence. The South African Labour party member might come in handy for some information I seek. Overall, it was a night full of surprises and laughter.",1
"""It was no easy task, not by a long shot! The rain had turned the branches incredibly slippery, and I struggled to keep my footing, but slowly and steadily I made my way up until I reached the window. ""But my excitement soon turned to disappointment. I had positioned myself too far to the left. All I could catch a glimpse of was the side of the room. A sliver of curtain, and a piece of wallpaper was the extent of my view. It was of no use to me, but just as I was about to retreat and climb back down in defeat, a movement inside caught my eye and a shadow appeared on the wall - it was unmistakably Whittington! ""That sight fueled my determination even more.""",1
"I fulfilled my assignment successfully, making sure to collect payment upfront. I meticulously planned every detail, knowing this would be my final job before leaving the business. As for your reference to burning bridges, I must admit I am at a loss. I am not a revolutionary leader, but rather a distinguished English tourist who stumbled upon a secret in a local antique store and was subsequently abducted. Soon enough, I will likely be discovered bound and in a desperate state of fear and hunger, once the timing is right.",1
"“Listen up! I need to give you a heads up, whether you want it or not. That guy is capable of murder without a second thought. He's trouble. You can argue all you want, but keep in mind what I'm saying. He's trouble!” “What was her response?” Miss Howard pulled a face full of emotion. “‘Beloved Alfred’ ‘darling Alfred’ ‘vicious accusations’ ‘false accusations’ ‘vicious woman’ for pointing fingers at her ‘beloved husband!’ It's best for me to leave her place sooner rather than later. So I’m out.” “Right now?” “Immediately!” We gazed at her in silence for a moment.",1
"""He detailed the strategies for housing the locals, the investigations launched, and the various safeguards implemented by De Beers. ""So, it's nearly impossible to steal diamonds?"" inquired Mrs. Blair, her disappointment palpable. ""Nothing is ever truly impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do happen, like the incident where a Kafir concealed a stone in his wound."" ""But on a larger scale?"" ""There was one instance, not long ago. Just before the War, actually. You recall that case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?"" I nodded. ""Please, share the story,"" urged Miss Beddingfeld.",1
"""So we have come to the conclusion that Madame Renauld fabricated the truth out of love for a man, specifically Georges Conneau. Do you agree with this assessment?"" ""Yes,"" I confessed. ""It does make sense."" ""Good! Madame Renauld's affection lies with Georges Conneau. But who is Georges Conneau?"" ""The vagrant."" ""Do we have any proof that Madame Renauld cared for the vagrant?"" ""No, but..."" ""In that case, let go of theories that lack evidence. Instead, consider who Madame Renauld truly loved."" I shook my head in confusion. ""But of course, you already know.""",1
"The suspect in the theft of the papers, Luigi Valdarno, was found dead in New York with no papers on him. He had been associated with a mysterious woman, Miss Elsa Hardt, who vanished around the same time. The American Secret Service suspected her to be an international spy.

"Lord Yardly was shocked to see the diamond known as ""The Star of the East."" Poirot assured him that it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen in order to preserve it. Poirot then revealed that the diamond was originally in the possession of Mr. Rolf, who had been blackmailing Lady Yardly. Rolf had substituted a fake diamond for the real one, and orchestrated a double robbery to cover his tracks. Lady Yardly played her part in the robbery by pretending to be a victim.",1
"""Listen, you have no idea who he is,"" she gasped. Suddenly, a scream escaped her lips as she jumped up in fear. Her trembling hand pointed behind Tuppence. Then, she collapsed to the floor in a dead faint. Tuppence turned around to see what had alarmed her. Standing in the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius Hersheimmer. SIR James pushed past Julius and rushed to the fallen woman. ""Heart,"" he exclaimed urgently. ""The sudden sight of us must have shocked her. Get some brandy quickly, or she'll slip away."" Julius hurried to the washstand.",1
"“I could have sworn it was the master, the resemblance was uncanny.” Mrs. Maltravers jumped in fear, reminding me of the old belief that spirits of suicides are restless. She seemed to share the same thought, as moments later she grabbed Poirot's arm in a panic. ""Did you not hear that? Three taps on the window? That was his signature signal when he roamed the premises."" ""It was just the ivy brushing against the glass,"" I interjected. However, an unsettling fear began to grip us all. The parlourmaid was visibly shaken, and after dinner, Mrs. Maltravers begged Poirot to delay his departure. She was clearly petrified at the thought of being alone. We all gathered in the cozy morning-room.",1
"""One learns to value life and death with ease.” “Indeed,” I replied, recalling Harry Rayburn. He had shared that sentiment. “But one should not mistreat the vulnerable?” “There are varying opinions on what constitutes ‘vulnerability,’ Miss Anne.” His tone turned serious, catching me off guard. It dawned on me that I had little insight into the man walking beside me. “I was referring to children and animals, perhaps.” “I can assure you I’ve never been unkind to children or animals. Do you consider women as ‘vulnerable’?” I paused. “No, I don’t believe I do, although they may be, I suppose.”",1
"“Excuse me, if it’s already spoken for.” “Oh, I apologize, ma'am. I've been bothered quite a bit by those journalists. Can't catch a break. No, the house isn't rented and probably won't be now.” “Are the pipes faulty?” I questioned quietly. “Goodness, no, ma'am, the pipes are fine! But surely you've heard about that foreign woman who was murdered here?” “I think I remember reading something about it in the news,” I replied casually. My lack of concern intrigued the kind lady. Had I shown any curiosity, she likely would have clammed up.",1
"""I've made a reappearance,"" I informed him gravely. ""How's everything, Mr. Pagett?"" ""All good, looking forward to getting back to work with Sir Eustace,"" he replied. ""There's something I need to ask you,"" I began cautiously. ""It's crucial, more than you realize. What were you doing in Marlow on January 8th?"" His reaction was immediate. ""Miss Beddingfeld, I..."" ""You were there, right?"" ""I had my reasons for being in the area,"" he admitted. ""Care to share those reasons with me?"" ""Hasn't Sir Eustace already filled you in?"" ""Sir Eustace? Does he know?"" ""I'm pretty sure he does.""",1
"He appeared kind and fatherly, treating me as a naive girl facing a cruel world. There was no use arguing. I knew my father, a great but poor man, left me with a disappointing inheritance. Mr. Flemming suggested I stay with them, an opportunity I eagerly accepted. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me warmly, as I tried to make myself look like the stereotypical orphan. Despite my doubts about my appearance, I was determined to find a job. My reflection in the mirror didn't seem to match the compliments I had received.",1
"""Yet the letter from Mr. Renauld? It clearly alludes to a hidden truth involving Santiago?"" ""Certainly, a concealed aspect of M. Renauld's past seems evident. However, I believe the mention of Santiago is merely a diversion, a tactic to mislead us. Perhaps it was intentionally used to divert M. Renauld's suspicions away from a closer threat. Rest assured, Hastings, the danger looming over him did not originate in Santiago, but rather much closer, within France."" His words carried a weight of seriousness and certainty that left me no room for doubt.",1
"""Absolutely dreadful! Scotland Yard officers swarming the premises like bees in a hive! Media frenzy with headlines screaming across the nation - journalists have no shame. And to top it off, a crowd gathered at the lodge gates this morning, like some free exhibition of horrors. Quite unsettling, wouldn't you agree?"" ""Don't worry, John,"" I reassured him. ""This chaos will eventually pass."" ""Will it really? It may linger long enough to forever tarnish our reputation.""",1
"""Hmm."" Poirot appeared to have run out of questions. I moved closer to him, as John and the attorney deliberated on the issue of examining Mrs. Inglethorp's documents. ""Do you believe Mrs. Inglethorp left all her wealth to Miss Howard in a will?"" I whispered, intrigued. Poirot grinned. ""No."" ""Then why did you inquire?"" ""Shh!"" John Cavendish had directed his attention to Poirot. ""Will you join us, Monsieur Poirot? We are reviewing my mother's papers. Mr. Inglethorp is happy to entrust everything to Mr. Wells and me.""

"""There are just half a dozen English and American women in total, and they are all significantly senior to the woman you seek. You will not locate her here, sir."" His certainty made me question myself. ""Yet the woman informed me she was residing here."" ""Sir, you must be mistaken or perhaps the woman is, as another man came by earlier asking for her."" ""Excuse me?"" I exclaimed, taken aback. ""Indeed, sir. A man who depicted her exactly as you have.""",1
"""Poirot wasted no time in confronting Captain Black as soon as he arrived at the inn. Without delay, he brought him up to our room, where we had been waiting. ""I have informed Captain Black of our purpose here,"" Poirot stated.

You were present just before the incident occurred, providing valuable insight that we seek.""",1
"""Tommy grabbed his arm, a look of concern on his face. “Any news on Tuppence?” Julius shook his head, handing over a freshly arrived telegram. Tommy’s eyes widened as he read the message: “Jane Finn located. Urgent - come to Manchester Midland Hotel. PEEL EDGERTON.” Folding up the telegram, Julius remarked, “Strange. I thought that lawyer had given up!” “I just arrived half an hour ago,” Julius explained, leading the way out of the station. “I assumed you’d receive this before I left London, so I wired Sir James. He’s arranged for our rooms and will join us for dinner at eight.”",1

""I can think of a few reasons,"" Tommy retorted.   ""Listen, you've been bombarding me with questions. How about I ask one for a change? Why didn't you finish me off immediately, before I woke up?""   The German paused, giving Tommy the opening he needed.   ""Because you have no idea how much I know and where I got that information.

"Efforts to locate the missing individual proved futile, despite Signor Ascanio's insistence on his innocence and lack of association with the victim. The Daily Newsmonger kept the public informed of the unfolding events surrounding the arrest of Signor Ascanio for the murder of Count Foscatini. Rumors swirled about the mysterious second man allegedly involved in the crime, but his whereabouts remained a mystery. Signor Ascanio's arrival at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent just two days prior to the murder only added to the intrigue of the case.",1
"I recited the numbers as they appeared before me. “1 71 22.” “Look,” Suzanne pointed out, “it’s similar, but not quite. It’s still one o’clock, and the 22nd, but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” Our eyes locked, thrilled by our revelation and consumed by anticipation as if we had unraveled the entire enigma. Then reality hit me hard. “But, Suzanne, nothing significant occurred here at one o’clock on the 22nd.” Her expression mirrored disappointment. “No, nothing did.” Another thought crossed my mind. “This isn’t the cabin you originally reserved, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you were initially assigned?” “No, the purser switched me to it.” “I wonder if it was pre-booked before departure for someone who never showed up.”",1
"However, despite the gossip, there were many who claimed that young Conneau was not the only one who held Madame Beroldy's affections. Approximately three months after the Beroldys arrived in Paris, another notable figure entered the picture. Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a wealthy American, found himself captivated by the charming and enigmatic Madame Beroldy. His admiration for her was clear, yet always maintained a sense of respect. As time passed, Madame Beroldy began to confide in a few close friends, expressing her concerns for her husband's well-being.",1
"""Following the arrival of the hesitant archdeacon, who appeared slightly overwhelmed by the group he was surrounded by, he was relieved to see his daughter being recognized for her achievements. Despite feeling anxious, he couldn't help but glance nervously at her intermittently. Tuppence, however, conducted herself impeccably. She refrained from crossing her legs, carefully monitored her words, and resolutely declined to smoke. Dr. Hall entered next, with the American Ambassador trailing behind.

I know my responsibility. My decision is final. Do not assume that any concern about exposure, or marital scandal will stop me.' Then I sensed they were approaching, so I made a swift exit."" ""Are you certain it was Mr.",1
"Inglethorp!"" Poirot considered a ""man of method"" to be the highest compliment. As he spoke, I could sense a change in my friend's demeanor. ""There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, mon ami? There might have been? Yes."" His gaze swept the room before he continued, ""this boudoir reveals nothing more. It has not provided much insight. Only this."" He retrieved a crumpled envelope from his pocket and handed it to me. The envelope was plain and dirty, with a few words scribbled haphazardly across it. Here is a replica of the message.",1
"With quivering hands, they carefully unfolded the mysterious sheet. To their surprise, it was completely empty! Looking at each other in bewilderment, Julius hesitantly suggested, ""A decoy, perhaps?"" But Tommy was not convinced. Then, a spark of realization hit Tommy, ""I know! Invisible ink!"" ""Do you really think so?"" asked Julius skeptically. ""It's worth a shot. Heat usually reveals it. Let's start a fire."" Within moments, a small fire was crackling with twigs and leaves.

I find marriage delightful, even with Clarence!” I dismissed her casual attitude. “What concerns me,” I stated firmly, “is Colonel Race's involvement in all of this. He is definitely part of the puzzle.” “Do you truly believe it was mere coincidence, his recounting that tale?” “Absolutely not,” I asserted. “He was observing us all intently. You recall, some of the diamonds were recovered, but not all.""",1

When I awoke, I found myself being dragged between two individuals, their arms propping me up while a gag silenced my cries. Despite the blackness surrounding us, it became clear we were still inside the hotel, navigating through the chaos of voices in various languages clamoring for answers about the power outage.

First the owners, then the maid. The place should be clear now."" ""What's the plan?"" I inquired nervously. Poirot swiftly headed to the scullery, pulling on the coal-lift rope.

"She had a subtle dimple in her round chin and her half parted lips held a mysterious smile. There was an exaggeratedly feminine quality about her, both yielding and seductive.

Taxis always seem scarce when you're in a hurry, but we managed to find one and headed towards Regent's Park. Regent's Court, a modern apartment building near St. John's Wood Road, was our destination. The building was equipped with all the latest technology. The hallway was empty.

One of them, Mr. Vavasour, sported a short white beard while the other, Mr. Shaw, was cleanly shaven. “I hear you specialize in discreet inquiries,” remarked Mr. Vavasour. “That is correct. We are also working closely with Scotland Yard on this matter. Inspector McNeil is overseeing the investigation, a highly skilled detective, as I understand it.”",1
"In the small, sealed room with a heavy, soundproof door, he was completely isolated. No matter how loudly he yelled, no one would come to his aid. It felt like a tomb. Tommy forced himself to focus, sitting on the bed to collect his thoughts. His hunger and headache were overwhelming in the oppressive silence. ""At least,"" he thought, ""I'll come face to face with the notorious Mr. Brown and maybe even the elusive Jane Finn.""",1
"Inglethorp’s bell wire had been expertly severed, leading to a critical discovery. Mademoiselle Cynthia had made plans to stay with friends on Monday evening, leaving Mrs. Inglethorp isolated in the right wing of the estate. With no one to turn to for help, Mrs. Inglethorp's fate seemed sealed. However, an unexpected twist unfolded. Due to Mrs. Inglethorp's eagerness to attend the village entertainment, she neglected to take her medicine. The following day, she dined out, unknowingly delaying the fatal dose by a full twenty-four hours. This unforeseen turn of events proved to be the undoing of the murderer, as the final piece of evidence fell into the detective's possession.",1
"""Mr. Davenheim was known to be out sending a letter, leaving him alone in the study!"" ""Perhaps he took advantage of the situation,"" I proposed. ""But how about the tools? It's not common for city dwellers to carry burglary tools just in case! And it would be impossible to break into that safe with just a pocket knife, of course!"" ""What about Suspect Two?"" ""You mentioned that Lowen harbored resentment towards Mr. Davenheim. What you're really saying is that he had outsmarted him once or twice. And presumably, those dealings were done to benefit himself. Typically, you don't hold a grudge against someone you've outsmarted - it's usually the other way around.""",1
"Colonel Race signaled with his hand. Arthur Minks, also known as the Rev. Edward Chichester and Miss Pettigrew, hesitantly stepped forward. Despite his pallor and nervous demeanor, he recounted, “I encountered Nadina in Paris the evening prior to her departure for England. At that time, I was assuming the identity of a Russian Count. She confided in me about her intentions. Although I cautioned her against it, fully aware of the individual she was dealing with, she disregarded my warning. A wireless message lay on the nearby table, which I proceeded to peruse. Subsequently, I contemplated making an attempt for the diamonds myself. However, in Johannesburg, I was approached by Mr. Rayburn.""",1
"""The birds have escaped just as we suspected. Let's investigate further."" Exploring the abandoned residence felt surreal to Tommy. All the familiar details remained unchanged - the disorderly prison room, the shattered jug in the attic, the spacious meeting area with its extended table. However, any documents had vanished, presumably either eradicated or removed. Annette was nowhere to be found. ""Your account of the young woman has left me perplexed,"" Mr. Carter remarked.",1
"""I forgot that you didn’t know about Tuppence,” said Sir James quietly. The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully. Something in his voice made Tommy look up, wondering if this man had seen something they had missed. “I wish you’d been there, sir, to go over the house,” Tommy spoke impulsively. Sir James sat in silence for a moment before asking, “And since then? What have you been doing?” Tommy realized the lawyer was unaware of the situation and slowly explained.",1
"""A clandestine rendezvous for instructions!"" ""Do not hiss in my direction, Pagett,"" I remarked, taking a step back, ""and please regulate your breath. Your suggestion is preposterous. What reason would they have for arranging a covert meeting in the dead of night? If they had anything to discuss, they could easily converse over a cup of tea in a nonchalant and ordinary manner."" Despite my arguments, it was clear that Pagett remained unconvinced. ""Something definitely occurred last night, Sir Eustace,"" he insisted, ""otherwise why would Rayburn viciously attack me."" ""You are positive it was Rayburn?"" Pagett seemed entirely certain of that detail. It was the one aspect of his account that lacked ambiguity.",1
"“I love you? How is that possible, given everything you know about me?” “I'm not sure,” I replied, feeling a sense of exhaustion wash over me. “Love is a force beyond control. I've attempted to resist it from the moment we first crossed paths. But love, it seems, is more powerful than my will.” Unexpectedly, she collapsed to the ground once more, consumed by uncontrollable sobs. “I can't go on like this!” she wailed. “I'm lost, with no direction. Please, someone, have mercy on me and show me the way!” Once again, I knelt beside her, offering what comfort I could muster.",1
"""Came up against a brick wall at the entrance, but that stubborn French gendarme was not budging. Even if I brought out Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots all at once, it wouldn’t make a difference to him! It’s a stroke of luck running into you like this. Come on, give me the grand tour.” “Hold on a second, I can’t do that. It’s off limits to everyone. They enforce the rules strictly.” “Aren’t you two big shots?” I was reluctant to let go of my sense of importance. “What’s driving your curiosity?” I asked hesitantly. “And what exactly do you want to see.”",1
"""Could there really be two girls with a name like that?"" pondered Tuppence. Mr. Whittington slammed his fist on the desk. ""Quit playing games! What's your price for the information?"" The mention of money caught Tuppence's attention, especially after a meager breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Though her current role was more of an adventuress than an adventurer, she couldn't ignore the potential opportunities.",1
"""Looks like he made a bet in the servants' quarters that he could pass for the old man in front of you, Captain Hastings, and would give him a bunch of espionage details about a Big Four gang."" ""No way!"" I exclaimed. ""Believe it or not. I escorted our gentleman directly to Hatton Chase, and the real Ryland was there in bed and fast asleep, with the butler, the cook, and who knows how many others willing to confirm the bet. Just a foolish prank, nothing more, and his valet is with him."" ""So that explains why he stayed hidden,"" whispered Poirot. After Japp left, we exchanged glances. ""We understand, Hastings,"" Poirot finally said. ""Abe Ryland is Number Two of the Big Four.""",1
"As I finally managed to free myself from the tangle of limbs, my target had already slipped through the doorway. A waiter, burdened with a tower of plates, collided with me unexpectedly, causing yet another obstacle in my pursuit. When I reached the exit, the slender man with the dark beard had vanished without a trace. Despite the waiter's profuse apologies and the composed demeanor of the overweight man at the nearby table, I couldn't shake the feeling that these incidents were anything but accidental. The presence of the Big Four's operatives lurked in every shadow, yet I chose to ignore the cautionary signs that were undoubtedly placed in my path.",1
"""Excuse me, but could you please unlock Mr. Opalsen's room for me?"" Poirot asked the chambermaid. She led the way to the room, unlocking it with her pass-key. Poirot showed her a card, asking if she had seen it before, but she hadn't. Poirot then asked the valet the same question, with no luck. As Poirot prepared to leave for London, he asked Hastings to brush off some French chalk powder from his coat sleeve. The next day, Poirot revealed that the chambermaid and valet were the culprits behind the theft of the necklace, using a clever plan involving the French chalk.",1
"""I have only two more days left with the radium, sir. My experiments will be complete by then,"" the woman said.  Poirot's eyes lit up. ""And Inez Veroneau is informed of this? Excellent, our associates will return. Not a word about me to anyone, madam. Rest assured, I will safeguard your radium. Do you possess a key to the door connecting the laboratory to the garden?""  ""Yes, sir. Here it is. I have a spare for myself. Additionally, here is the key to the garden door that opens into the alleyway between this villa and the adjacent one.""  ""Thank you, madam.",1
"Tuppence took a brief moment to appreciate her own cleverness before replying gently, ""I wouldn't want to argue with you, Mr. Whittington."" ""So, the question as always, how much?"" Tuppence found herself in a difficult position. She had managed to deceive Whittington so far, but suggesting an obviously unrealistic amount might raise his suspicions. Suddenly, an idea came to her. ""What if we agree on a small initial payment, with a more detailed discussion to follow?"" Whittington shot her a menacing look. ""Is this blackmail?"" Tuppence responded with a charming smile. ""Oh, no! How about we consider it payment for future services?"" Whittington grunted in response.",1
"""I let out a breath of relief. ""You'll send it right away?"" I pressed. He grinned and shook his head. ""It will be sent when M. Hercule Poirot is within my grasp. Not a moment sooner."" ""But you gave your word."" ""Should this plan falter, I might have to rely on our little persuasion bird to motivate you further."" Rage washed over me. ""Dear God! If you "" He waved a lengthy, slender yellow hand. ""Rest assured, I have faith it will not fail. And once M. Poirot is in our possession, I will uphold my promise."" ""If you betray me."" ""I've sworn on the honor of my ancestors. You have nothing to fear. Take a break here. My staff will attend to your needs while I'm away."" I found myself alone in this opulent subterranean sanctuary.""",1
"“There’s a rather impressive collection in that room. Do they see much use?” “Not so much these days, though occasionally we host what the boys refer to as a ‘fancy dress night.’ Quite amusing, if I may say so. Mr. Lawrence, in particular, is a riot. Utterly hilarious! I still recall the evening he appeared as the Shah of Persia, or something of the sort. A regal Eastern monarch, he claimed. He wielded a large letter opener and warned, ‘Dorcas, mind your manners and show proper respect.’”",1
"""Race, please, share with us the details,"" he prompted. ""Of course, I will divulge the tale. I'm sure you are all familiar with Sir Laurence Eardsley, the prominent South African tycoon? Although his wealth stemmed from gold mines, his son is the focus of this narrative. Prior to the War, rumors circulated about a potential new Kimberley hidden in the rocky terrain of the British Guiana rainforest. According to reports, two daring explorers had recently journeyed back from that region of South America, showcasing an extraordinary assortment of uncut diamonds, including some notably large ones.""",1
"""They don’t want to discourage me altogether. On the other hand, they don’t want to make it too easy. I’m a pawn in their game, Albert, that’s what I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that promising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who’s blundered in just at the right moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!” Tommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had elaborated a careful plan for the following evening.",1
"“Absolutely the hand of Mr. Brown!” Mr. Carter declared, taking a moment to pause. “You see what you are up against? Likely the most brilliant criminal mind of our time. It’s a concern, you know. You’re both so young. I would hate for anything to happen to you.” “We’ll be fine,” Tuppence insisted confidently. “I’ll watch out for her,” Tommy added. “And I’ll watch out for you,” Tuppence shot back, bristling at the protective tone. “Well, then, watch out for each other,” Mr. Carter suggested with a smile. “Now, let’s refocus on the matter at hand. There’s a hidden aspect to this treaty that we have yet to uncover.”",1
"""I have an elderly uncle who's quite well-off, but he's no good,"" Tommy explained. ""He once tried to adopt me, but I turned him down."" Tuppence recalled, ""I think I heard about that. You declined because of your mother."" Tommy blushed. ""Yes, it wouldn't have been fair to her. She was all I had. The old man despised her and wanted me away from her. Pure malice."" ""Your mother has passed away, right?"" Tuppence asked softly. Tommy confirmed with a nod, causing Tuppence's eyes to glisten with emotion.",1
"""I believe we can ease her distress. Shall we ascend?” “Of course.” Tommy’s heart raced as they accompanied the doctor upstairs. Jane Finn finally! The sought-after, the enigmatic, the elusive Jane Finn! Success had seemed so unlikely! And here in this residence, her memory nearly miraculously restored, lay the girl who held England's fate in her hands. Tommy let out a half sigh. If only Tuppence could have been there with him to witness the triumphant end of their shared endeavor! But he pushed thoughts of Tuppence away. His trust in Sir James was strengthening. He was a man who would surely uncover Tuppence’s location.",1
"""I wanted to ask how you knew about those two?"" ""My friend, I understand human nature. When you combine a young boy like Renauld with a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, the outcome is almost certain. And then, the argument! It was either money or a woman, and recalling Léonie's account of the boy's rage, I deduced the latter. So I took a chance and I was correct."" ""So that's why you cautioned me against falling for the lady? You already suspected that she had feelings for young Renauld?"" Poirot grinned. ""At least I noticed that she had worried eyes.""",1
"""For example, if the killers sought revenge, why not simply stab Renauld while he slept and be done with it?"" ""They were after the 'secret',"" I pointed out. Poirot flicked a speck of dust off his coat sleeve with a dissatisfied expression. ""But where is this 'secret'? It must be some distance away, as they made him get dressed. Yet his body was discovered murdered nearby, almost within earshot of the house. Furthermore, it seems too convenient for a weapon like the dagger to be casually lying around, easily accessible.""",1
"""I have secured them and, in my view, it is best to keep them locked up for now."" The physicians left soon after. An idea had been brewing in my mind, and I sensed that the time was ripe to introduce it. However, I hesitated a bit. Knowing John's aversion to any form of attention and his laid-back outlook on life, I was unsure of how he would react. Convincing him of the validity of my proposal might prove to be challenging. On the contrary, Lawrence, with his unconventional nature and vivid imagination, seemed like a potential ally. It was evident that the moment had arrived for me to take charge.",1
"I saw that I would be intercepted before reaching the platform I sought. Glancing at the clock, it showed one minute until eleven. If my scheme worked, I could pull it off. I had used the main entrance on Adderly Street to access the station. Now, I swiftly exited through a side door. Across from me stood the post office's side entrance, the primary one being on Adderly Street. As predicted, instead of pursuing me inside, my pursuer ran down the street to intercept me at the main entrance, or to signal the policeman to do so.",1
"As we were still reeling from the doctor's bombshell, a telegram arrived at the Villa. It was a message from Poirot, informing me of his imminent return on the 12:28 train to Merlinville. With a quick glance at my watch, I realized I had just enough time to reach the station and greet him. It was crucial that Poirot be briefed on the latest shocking turn of events in the investigation. Clearly, he had wasted no time in obtaining the information he sought in Paris.",1
"A large, faded chintz-covered settee was placed against the wall, while the window seats were also covered in the same pattern. Poirot, with his tiny cigarette, emphasized the need to carefully search the room for clues, especially in the desk. The key to the desk had a dirty envelope with a handwritten label, which Poirot found suspicious. The Bakers, sympathetic to Miss Violet, recalled the events surrounding the will signing. Poirot's investigation led to the discovery of a hiding place created by workmen from Plymouth, where a cavity was made beneath a brick in the fireplace. The cavity revealed crucial evidence, and Poirot wasted no time in examining it further.",1
"""I remember the purser assuring me that cabin."" ""Pursers are always so preoccupied, don't you think?"" I replied vaguely. ""They're bound to overlook things from time to time."" Mr. Chichester remained silent. ""Is this your initial journey to Africa?"" I asked casually. ""To South Africa, yes. However, I've spent the past couple of years among the cannibal tribes in the heart of East Africa."" ""How exciting! Have you encountered many close calls?"" ""Close calls?"" ""Of being devoured, I mean?"" ""You shouldn't joke about such serious matters, Miss Beddingfeld.""",1
"Who is he? His identity remains a mystery. What does he look like? That remains unknown as well. How many times have we crossed paths with him? Five encounters, if memory serves me right. But can either of us confidently claim that we could identify him if we were to see him again? I pondered over the five distinct individuals who, inexplicably, turned out to be the same person. The stout keeper of the asylum, the man with the buttoned overcoat in Paris, James the footman, the reserved young doctor involved in the Yellow Jasmine case, and the enigmatic Russian Professor. None of them bore any resemblance to one another. ""No,"" I admitted, feeling defeated.",1
"I struck up a conversation with Mr. Chichester, hoping to glean some information. He mentioned his time in Africa, but I couldn't help but notice his lack of sunburn. As he fumbled with a piece of paper, claiming it was part of a sermon, my suspicions grew. Later, during a conversation about Italy, Mr. Pagett seemed uneasy and quickly excused himself. Sir Eustace joked about his secretary possibly committing a dark deed in Florence. Despite his respectable appearance, the idea lingered in the air. As the group dispersed, Mr. Chichester's clumsy action caught my attention once again. Colonel Race then approached me, commenting on my elusive nature at the previous night's dance. We discussed plans for the evening, hinting at a dance together.",1
"""And you were correct."" I gazed helplessly at Poirot, and he acknowledged my look. ""My dear Hastings is, as you Brits say, enjoying the seaside. Have a seat, and I will detail the entire case that has concluded so satisfactorily."" ""Concluded?"" ""Indeed. They have been apprehended."" ""Who has been apprehended?"" ""The chambermaid and the valet, of course! Did you not suspect? Especially after my mention of French chalk?"" ""You mentioned it was used by cabinet-makers."" ""Indeed, to help drawers slide smoothly. Someone wanted that drawer to move in silence. Who else but the chambermaid? The plan was so clever that it eluded even Hercule Poirot at first glance.""",1
"""Without fail, Poirot's intuition proved correct. Soon after, the famous American movie star entered the room, prompting us to stand up in respect. Mary Marvell was undeniably one of the most beloved actresses in Hollywood. She had recently arrived in England with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, who was also a well-known actor. Their wedding had occurred just a year earlier in the United States, marking their inaugural trip to England. The couple had been warmly welcomed by the public. Mary Marvell's stunning attire, luxurious furs, and exquisite jewelry, particularly a diamond known as ""the Western Star,"" had captivated everyone's attention.""",1
"""I can't wait to ditch him in Cape Town,"" she said. ""He's staying?"" ""Yes, he'll have a blast playing detective after Rayburn. It's right up Pagett's alley. He loves a good mystery. But I'm serious about my invitation. Will you join us? Mrs. Blair will be there to chaperone, and you can take breaks to explore."" ""Thank you, Sir Eustace,"" I replied, ""but I think I'm heading to Durban tonight."" ""Don't be stubborn. Remember, there are plenty of lions in Rhodesia. You'll enjoy the lions.""",1
"""Mrs. Davenheim is a rather unintelligent woman, a nonentity,"" pondered Poirot. ""Had he any enemies?"" ""Plenty of financial rivals,"" replied Hastings. ""A figure was seen near the rose-garden,"" mentioned Hastings. ""Beyond lies a lake with a boathouse,"" added Hastings. Japp walked in bursting with news. ""We found his clothes, identical to what he wore that day,"" announced Japp. ""Lowen was seen near the study,"" continued Japp. ""Mr. Davenheim's ring was pawned by Billy Kellett,"" Japp explained. ""Kellett saw a man with a big moustache,"" shared Japp.",1
"“That's Dr. Bauerstein,” John remarked tersely. “And who might Dr. Bauerstein be?” “He's a London specialist, staying in the village for a rest cure following a severe nervous breakdown. He's renowned for his expertise in poisons, one of the foremost authorities in the field, I hear.” “And he happens to be a close friend of Mary's,” Cynthia added with her usual enthusiasm. John Cavendish furrowed his brow and shifted the conversation. “Care to take a walk, Hastings? This entire ordeal has been utterly dreadful. Evelyn Howard may have had a sharp tongue, but she was an unwavering friend.” With that, he led the way through the plantation, and we made our way to the village, traversing the woods that lined the estate.",1
"I detest the idea of being hungry, though I am not concerned for my safety. Smuts will handle the revolution capably. But oh, how I long for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will remember to bring a bottle of whisky when he comes tomorrow? I threw on my hat and headed out, planning to purchase a few souvenirs. The curio shops in Jo’burg are quite charming. While examining a window full of luxurious karosses, a man exiting the shop bumped into me. To my surprise, it was Race. He didn't seem pleased to see me, but I insisted he accompany me back to the hotel. I tire of only having Miss Pettigrew to converse with. ""I had no clue you were in Jo’burg,"" I said conversationally. ""When did you arrive?""",1
"After listing off dates, prices, and names of unfamiliar places, they finally finished checking and counting. ""Excellent,"" declared Chichester, the scraping of his chair indicating his departure. ""I will bring these to show the 'Colonel'."" ""When are you leaving?"" ""Ten o'clock tomorrow morning works for me."" ""Do you wish to visit the girl before your departure?"" ""No. It's strictly forbidden for anyone to see her until the 'Colonel' arrives. Is she doing well?"" ""I peeked in on her during dinner. I believe she was fast asleep.""",1
"""They're a dangerous group, Annette. If you assist me, I can remove you from their influence. And you might receive a substantial sum of money."" But the young woman simply shook her head. ""I cannot, sir; I am terrified of them."" She turned away. ""Wouldn't you do anything to help a fellow woman?"" pleaded Tommy. ""She's around your age as well. Will you not rescue her from their grasp?"" ""You're referring to Jane Finn?"" ""Indeed."" ""It's her you're searching for here? Right?"" ""Precisely."" The woman gazed at him, then brushed her hand over her brow. ""Jane Finn. That name is always in my ears. It sounds familiar.""",1
"Poirot, the one and only Hercule Poirot, was found dead! The match-box, purposefully disarranged, was a clever trap that would surely grab his attention, causing him to rearrange it and unknowingly trigger an explosion. Despite the fact that I was the one who set off the chain of events, I couldn't shake the overwhelming sense of guilt. According to Doctor Ridgeway, it was nothing short of a miracle that I survived with just a minor head injury. Even though it felt like I regained consciousness right away, it took a full day before I fully came to.",1
"Lord Estair was visibly shaken as he entered Poirot's office. ""I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy,"" he said. Poirot assured him, ""You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!"" Lord Estair then revealed the shocking news - the Prime Minister had been kidnapped just before the crucial Allied Conference. As Poirot delved deeper into the details, it became clear that time was of the essence. The race was on to rescue the Prime Minister before the conference began the following evening. The situation was dire, the stakes were high, and Poirot knew that failure was not an option.",1
"Poirot examined the crime scene meticulously, his attention caught by a piece of lead-piping near the spade. Giraud dismissed it as irrelevant, but Poirot's curiosity was piqued. He then proceeded to explore the locked shed, much to Giraud's annoyance. The detective seemed focused on trivial details, such as a whitewashed line around the grave, which he questioned M. Bex about. Despite Poirot's unconventional methods, Giraud was impressed by his efficiency. As they left the scene, Giraud continued his thorough search, while Poirot hinted at a deeper mystery surrounding the case.",1
"""Perhaps if the ring were found nearby, one could argue that Davenheim himself had accidentally dropped it,"" Japp suggested. ""But why bother removing it from the body at all?"" I exclaimed. ""There could be a specific reason for that,"" Japp replied. ""Did you know that just past the lake, there's a small gate that leads to the hill? And within a three-minute walk, you'll find what? A lime kiln.""""Goodness!"" I gasped. ""So you're saying that the lime used to dispose of the body wouldn't harm the metal of the ring?""""Exactly,"" Japp confirmed. ""It appears to me,"" I remarked, ""that this clarifies everything. What a ghastly crime!"" Without a word, we both turned to Poirot.",1
"""There was a piece of evidence in the case, seemingly insignificant but enough to link the killer to the crime. It was crucial for the killer to destroy it before it was uncovered and its importance recognized. That's why he decided to take the dangerous step of breaking into the place. However, the case was locked, forcing him to break it open and reveal his presence. The fact that he was willing to take such a risk indicated that the evidence was of significant value."" ""But what could it have been?"" ""Ah!"" exclaimed Poirot, showing frustration.""",1
"Poirot hesitated, gazing towards the building, as the young boy eagerly chatted beside him, gesturing. The moment had arrived for me to take action. I stepped into the corridor. With a subtle signal from the towering Chinaman, a servant unlocked the entrance. ""Don't forget the consequences of failure,"" my adversary whispered quietly. Outside, I stood on the staircase, motioning for Poirot to join me. He hurried over. ""Ah! I see you are unharmed, my dear friend. I was starting to worry. Were you able to gain entry? Is the residence deserted?"" ""Indeed,"" I replied, striving to keep my tone casual.",1
"In the cozy study, we found a charming couple - the man with a weathered face resembling a withered apple, and his wife exuding a sense of calm with her ample frame. Exhausted from the journey and the long drive, we had quickly retired to bed after a delicious meal of roast chicken, apple pie, and thick Devonshire cream. After a satisfying breakfast, we gathered in the small, wood-paneled room that once belonged to the late Mr. Marsh. A roll-top desk, meticulously organized with papers, adorned one wall, while a large leather armchair, clearly the favorite spot of its former owner, sat prominently in the room.",1
"""Not in here,"" Tuppence pointed out, gesturing towards the tantalus in the dining-room. ""Second door on the left down the hall."" Together, Sir James and Tuppence carefully moved Mrs. Vandemeyer and laid her onto the bed. They attempted to revive her by splashing water on her face, but saw no immediate response. The lawyer checked her pulse. ""It's touch and go,"" he murmured. ""I hope that young man brings the brandy soon."" Just then, Julius came back into the room with a glass of brandy, handing it to Sir James. Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer's head while the lawyer tried to get her to drink a little of the brandy. Finally, the woman weakly opened her eyes.",1
"All these notions raced through her mind in an instant, revealing a slim chance, albeit a risky one, that she could seize upon. Without hesitation, she staggered off the couch and dropped to her knees in front of Mrs. Vandemeyer, grabbing at her dress desperately. “I refuse to believe it,” she cried. “It must be poison, I'm certain of it. Please, spare me from drinking it” her tone escalated to a scream “spare me!” Mrs. Vandemeyer, holding a glass, peered down with a sneer at the sudden breakdown. “Get up, you foolish girl! Stop babbling nonsense.""",1
"He knew that maintaining the charade of a chess match was futile. Desperate to evade the inevitable showdown, he made every effort to deter Wilson. But when his attempts proved fruitless, Wilson's fate was sealed. It was imperative that Wilson never uncovered the truth - the renowned Savaronoff was utterly clueless when it came to chess. Aware of Wilson's preference for the Ruy Lopez opening, Number Four orchestrated a fatal strike by the third move, before any defensive strategies could be employed.",1
"""Obviously,” Giraud began, “I quickly uncovered the true nature of that Chilian deception. Two individuals were involved, but they were not enigmatic foreigners! It was all a smokescreen.” “Impressive work so far, my dear Giraud,” Poirot murmured. “Especially after their clever ploy with the match and cigarette butt.” Giraud glared, then continued: “Someone must have been implicated in the crime to have dug the grave. No one actually gains from the crime, but someone believed they would. I learned of Jack Renauld’s dispute with his father, and the threats he made. The motive was clear.”",1
"“Tell me, did you let Madame Daubreuil into the house last night?” “No, sir, it was the night before.” “But Françoise just said Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, sir. A woman did visit Mr. Renauld last night, but it wasn't Madame Daubreuil.” The magistrate pressed further, but the girl was adamant. She was positive it wasn't Madame Daubreuil. This woman was dark, but shorter and much younger. Her identification was unwavering. “Had you ever seen her before?” “Never, sir.” Then, the girl hesitated and added: “But I believe she was English.”",1
"Madame Daubreuil and her daughter were an intriguing pair. The daughter, innocent and pure, caught in the web of her mother's secrets. Madame Daubreuil, charming and enigmatic, with a past shrouded in mystery. As the examining magistrate probed for answers, the tension in the room grew palpable. The daughter's loyalty to her mother unwavering, while Madame Daubreuil's composure never faltered. The air was thick with unspoken truths and hidden motives. It was clear that beneath their facade of civility, lurked a darkness waiting to be revealed.",1
"""Indeed,"" Poirot remarked with a hint of disdain. ""Even in Santiago, they possess that knowledge. Even the most inexperienced English Miss is aware of it, thanks to the extensive publicity the Bertillon system has received in the media. Nevertheless, the absence of finger-prints intrigues me greatly. It is astonishingly simple to plant another person's prints. And the authorities are satisfied."" He sighed. ""I suspect our culprit lacks a systematic approach, or perhaps was rushed. Time will tell."" With that, he gently returned the body to its initial pose.",1
"Rayburn was crouched next to the man sprawled out near the saloon entrance. I rushed over, out of breath, and asked, ""Did you have to hit him?"" Rayburn's response was cold, ""No need. He was already like this when I found him. Or maybe he's faking. Let's find out who he is."" Anxious, I edged closer. It was clear that the man who attacked me was much larger than Chichester. Unlike Chichester, who was weak and flabby, this man seemed capable of using brute force. Rayburn lit a match, and we both gasped in shock.",1
"""Why was the Mill House chosen as the murder scene? Could Pagett have been made a scapegoat for the stolen diamonds in Kimberley if I had not intervened? Do you think he is innocent?"" ""It seems that way, but we need to uncover his activities in Marlow. If he can explain that, we might be on the right track."" Standing up, he said, ""It's late. Get some rest, Anne. I'll take you to the boat just before dawn. You need to catch the train in Livingstone. A friend will keep you safe until it's time to leave. Head to Bulawayo and catch the train to Beira.""",1
"""I've kept quiet for years, knowing I had this weapon in reserve. But now things have changed. I want my price, and it won't come cheap. It's quite a staggering amount,"" she declared. ""Incredible,"" the Count remarked. ""Do you really carry these diamonds with you at all times?"" His gaze swept across the messy room. Nadina chuckled softly. ""Don't assume anything. I'm not that foolish. The diamonds are hidden in a secure location where no one would think to look for them.""",1
"What cunning! He anticipated every move a detective might make, steps that I, a foolish fool, actually made. He prepares two wills, has the staff sign both, then confidently presents his will on the back of a crumpled receipt, using a pen filled with his own unique ink. Under false pretenses, he convinces the baker and his spouse to add their signatures below his, then attaches it to his desk key, smirking to himself. Should his niece uncover his deception, she will prove her worth and expensive education, earning her rightful claim to his fortune.",1
"""Have you noticed Pagett's shiner? I'm done with secretaries unless I find a nice girl with liquid eyes. What about you, Miss Anne? Will you come with me to Rhodesia?"" Sir Eustace asked. ""Thank you, but I must leave for Durban tonight,"" I replied. Despite my refusal, Sir Eustace insisted, mentioning lions in Rhodesia. As he called for Pagett, I hurried Suzanne to make plans. Suzanne expressed disappointment at not being able to go to Rhodesia, but I assured her she was still going. We discussed keeping an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race, with Suzanne even suggesting confiding in the latter. I objected, wary of the consequences of involving others in our adventure.",1
"I had informed the stewardess of my cold and insensitivity to smells. She appeared distressed, but I stood my ground. The evening dragged on, and I retired to bed, ready for any emergency. Vague thoughts crossed my mind, but I was certain that something would happen at one o’clock. The cabin was filled with silence as my fellow passengers settled in for the night. Suddenly, my door burst open, and a panicked man stumbled inside, pleading for help. With only seconds to spare, I swiftly concealed him behind my trunk and washed basin, transforming my appearance into that of a lady preparing for bed. When the door opened again, I was surprised to find a night stewardess standing there, looking for the source of the earlier noise.",1
"""Is that your plan, Tuppence?” “It’s easy to mock, but I sense there may be some truth to it.” “How do you intend to make contact with your potential employers?” “Advertisement,” Tuppence said quickly. “Do you have a piece of paper and a pen? Men always seem to. Just like we always have hairpins and makeup.” Tommy handed her a worn green notebook, and Tuppence started writing. “Shall we write: ‘Former military officer, experienced in combat ’” “Absolutely not.” “Fine, my dear boy.""",1
"We made our way there on camels, the creatures kneeling patiently as we prepared to mount. Surrounding us were several boys, led by a talkative dragoman. I won't dwell on the sight of Poirot on a camel. His journey began with groans and ended with screams, gestures, and prayers to the Virgin Mary and all the saints. Eventually, he gave up and traveled the rest of the way on a small donkey. I have to say, riding a trotting camel is no laughing matter. I was sore for days.",1
"""Ah, yes, indeed. That is where we must focus our efforts,"" he stated before turning towards the door. Just as he was about to leave, he hesitated and turned back to the woman seated in the room. ""Madam, did your late husband ever mention anything about 'The Big Four'?"" ""The Big Four,"" she echoed, deep in thought. ""No, I don't recall him ever mentioning that."" That was the extent of the information we could gather from Mrs. Halliday. We quickly made our way back to the city, and the very next day found us headed towards the European mainland. Poirot couldn't help but chuckle as he remarked, ""This Big Four certainly keeps me on my toes, my friend. I feel like I'm constantly running around, just like our dear old 'human foxhound'.""",1
"""Currently, I am swamped with work,"" Pagett announced. ""Oh, before you go,"" I called out, ""what did Mrs. Blair have in those suitcases?"" ""Just some fur rugs and a few fur hats, I believe."" ""Yes, that sounds right,"" I agreed. ""She picked them up on the train. They are rather unique hats, so I understand why you couldn't place them. Any other items of interest?"" ""A few rolls of film and numerous baskets,"" Pagett responded. ""Of course,"" I nodded. ""Mrs. Blair tends to buy things in bulk.""",1
"""An elderly man stood by the mantelpiece, his shoulders slightly stooped. Dr. Durand was his name. “Most extraordinary,” M. Hautet remarked after the commissary spoke. “Do you have the letter, Monsieur?” Poirot handed it over, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. A secret is mentioned. What a pity he did not provide more details. We are grateful for your help, M. Poirot. Will you assist in our investigations? Or must you return to London?” “M. le juge, I intend to stay. I may not have arrived in time to save my client, but I feel compelled by honor to uncover the killer.""",1
"Poirot revealed the shocking truth to Jack Renauld about his father's past, leading Jack to make a life-changing decision. Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and secretary, leaving behind a girl who loves him dearly. Poirot encouraged Jack to be honest with the girl and let her decide. Despite his doubts, Jack realized that true love conquers all and decided to pursue a future with her. As for Captain Hastings, his future plans remain uncertain, but the story ends with a light-hearted moment between him and a familiar face.",1
"""His persuasion led me to switch allegiance."" Sir Eustace glanced his way. He remained silent, yet Minks appeared to visibly crumble. ""Rats deserting a sinking ship,"" noted Sir Eustace. ""I despise rats. Sooner or later, I exterminate pests."" ""There's something I must disclose, Sir Eustace,"" I interjected. ""The tin you tossed out the window didn't hold the diamonds. It contained ordinary pebbles. The diamonds are securely hidden. In truth, they reside in the large giraffe's belly.""",1
"He ushered them through the old house to the scene of the crime - Mr. Paynter's office. The room was spacious, adorned with shelves of books and large, luxurious armchairs. Poirot's gaze immediately fell upon the window facing the gravel terrace. ""The window, was it left open?"" he inquired. ""That is the crux of the matter. The doctor exited through the door, simply pulling it closed. Yet, the following day, it was discovered locked. But by whom? Mr. Paynter? Ah Ling insists the window was shut tight. Dr.",1
"""I pondered, Why not? The ceaseless unraveling of senseless puzzles is wearing thin. I have garnered ample renown. I shall pocket this sum and establish myself close to my longtime comrade."" Poirot's gesture deeply moved me. ""Thus, I agreed,"" he revealed, ""and within sixty minutes, I must depart to board the ship-bound train. An amusing twist of fate, wouldn't you say? Nevertheless, I confess, Hastings, if the sum had not been so substantial, I may have hesitated, as of late I've initiated a personal inquiry.""",1
"“Could it have been Mrs. Inglethorp herself?” “There is another angle. Perhaps she simply neglected to secure the door to the passage before retiring for the night, only to rise later, in the early hours, and lock it then.” “Poirot, are you being serious?” “I am not asserting it as fact, but it is a possibility. Now, moving on to another aspect, how do you interpret the snippet of dialogue you caught between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?” “I had overlooked that,” I mused. “It remains as cryptic as ever. It is difficult to believe that someone like Mrs. Cavendish, with her pride and reserved nature, would meddle so forcefully in a matter that was clearly not her concern.” “Exactly.",1
"""Inglethorp’s sudden demise left many wondering about the fate of her wealth."" The attorney paused briefly before responding, ""The truth will become common knowledge soon enough. If Mr. Cavendish has no objections..."" John quickly interjected, ""None at all. I see no reason to evade your inquiry. In her final will, executed in August of the previous year, she bestowed her entire estate upon her stepson, Mr. John Cavendish, following a series of minor bequests to staff members, among others."" ""Wasn't that decision rather biased against her other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?"" ""I don't believe so.""",1
"He simply took her away! Upon her arrival in England, she was completely devastated, yet somehow still alive.” Poirot solemnly shook his head. I tried to keep a straight face. Suddenly, he froze and pointed dramatically at the toast rack. “Ah, for example, this is too much!” he exclaimed. “What's wrong?” “This piece of toast. Do you not notice it?” He grabbed the culprit from the rack and displayed it for me to see. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? No. Is it even round? No. Does it have any shape that is remotely pleasing to the eye? What kind of symmetry is this? None.” “It's sliced from a cottage loaf,” I explained calmly.",1
"Tommy anxiously awaited Albert's return at the inn. When Albert finally showed up, he revealed that while Tommy was being chased out of the window, something had been thrown out as well. Albert handed Tommy a piece of paper with just three words scribbled on it: ""Same time tomorrow."" Tommy was thrilled by this development. Albert went on to explain how he had written a message on a paper, wrapped it around a stone, and thrown it through the window. Tommy couldn't help but groan at Albert's audacious move.",1
"""I can't erase the memory. You're amazing. I get it now."" ""Remember when I said you could confide in Papa Poirot safely? You doubted me."" ""It all makes sense now,"" Lawrence remarked. ""The drugged cocoa, after the poisoned coffee, explains the delay."" ""True. But was the coffee really poisoned? That's the question. Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it."" ""What?"" Everyone was shocked. ""Yes. I mentioned a stain on Mrs. Inglethorp's carpet.""",1
"My aunt, who resides in the countryside, has been gravely ill for quite some time now. She’s calling out for me in her final moments.” Tommy gave a nod of approval. “Could you notify the appropriate authorities and rendezvous with me at Charing Cross in sixty minutes?” “I’ll be there, sir. You can rely on me.” As Tommy anticipated, loyal Albert proved to be a valuable companion. The two settled in at the inn in Gatehouse. Albert was tasked with gathering intel, which he did without any issues. Astley Priors was owned by Dr. Adams.",1
"""But he seemed kind, and incredibly intelligent. I wouldn’t hesitate to approach him and confess everything to him.” To her surprise, Julius immediately dismissed the idea. “Listen,” he said firmly, “we can’t involve any lawyers in this. That man wouldn’t be of any help to us.” “I believe he could,” Tuppence stubbornly insisted. “No chance. I’ll be back in thirty minutes.” Julius returned after thirty-five minutes. He grabbed Tuppence's arm and led her to the window. “There it is.” “Oh!” Tuppence exclaimed with a hint of admiration in her voice as she looked down at the massive car. “It's quite the speed demon,” Julius boasted.",1
"Madame Beroldy was a young and attractive woman, known for her charismatic personality. Rumors circulated about her mysterious background, with some claiming she was the illegitimate child of a Russian Grand Duke while others insisted it was an Austrian Archduke.

Her presence in the quarter caused quite a commotion, leaving many intrigued by the enigma that surrounded her.",1
"""But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I exclaimed. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, right?” “Yes, sir, but…” Poirot leaned in. “But what?” “M. Renauld was murdered this morning.” Poirot swiftly exited the car, his eyes filled with intensity. He grabbed the man by the shoulder. “What did you say? Murdered? When? How?” The police officer stood firm. “I cannot provide any answers, sir.” “Understood. I see.” Poirot pondered for a moment. “The Police Commissioner, he is inside?” “Yes, sir.” Poirot handed over a card, quickly jotting down a few words on it.",1
"I wondered why Poirot had come to London. Was it a last-minute choice or something he had planned earlier? Returning to Styles, I felt lost without Poirot's guidance. Did he know about the arrest in advance? Was he somehow involved? These questions plagued me. What should I do next? Should I inform everyone at Styles about the arrest, or keep it quiet? Despite my reluctance to admit it, I couldn't shake the worry about Mary Cavendish's reaction. Her potential shock troubled me deeply, pushing aside any doubts I had about her.",1
"""In the same way, he made it clear that he left the coffee in the hallway. Although overlooked during the inquest, this detail now holds great importance. Our task is to determine who brought the coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp or who passed by while it sat there. Based on your information, only two individuals can be ruled out as having any connection to the coffee: Mrs. Cavendish and Mademoiselle Cynthia."" ""Agreed,"" I replied, feeling a sense of relief. Mary Cavendish was undoubtedly innocent. ""By clearing Alfred Inglethorp,"" Poirot added, ""I have been forced to reveal my hand earlier than planned.""",1
"I had come across it before I realized my error. The piece was concise. I can recall every detail perfectly, and there was nothing in it that would cause any distress."" ""You want me to recite it?"" I prompted. ""Yes."" She hesitated for a moment and then slowly repeated, as I discreetly transcribed the words, the following: ""DEAR SIR, The most important thing now, I believe, is to inspect the estate. If you are adamant about including the quarry, then seventeen thousand appears fair. 11% commission is excessive, 4% is sufficient. ""Sincerely, ""ARTHUR LEVERSHAM.""

"Who was this mysterious young man who barged into my cabin unannounced? He was a complete stranger to me, not a crew member nor a fellow passenger. The real question remained: who was responsible for stabbing him, and for what reason? And what significance did Cabin No. 17 hold in this puzzling situation? As I pondered these questions, it became clear that something sinister was unfolding aboard the Kilmorden Castle. My list of suspects grew as I mentally noted those who required closer scrutiny.",1
"I was enjoying an evening with my friend, Gerald Parker. The conversation turned to house-hunting in London, a topic Parker was passionate about. He had moved from one flat to another, always finding new places. Mrs. Robinson shared that she and her husband had finally found a flat in Montagu Mansions for a surprisingly low price. Parker was astonished by the good deal, suspecting there must be a catch. Mrs. Robinson seemed uneasy, mentioning some strange things about the place that made her wonder if it was haunted. Parker dismissed the idea, but Mrs. Robinson was not convinced.",1

I went along with it at first because it made it easier for me to persuade you to lure Harry Rayburn here.""",1
"I headed out after lunch, wearing my best hat (a hand-me-down from Suzanne) and my least wrinkled white linen. Taking a quick train to Muizenberg, I arrived in just thirty minutes. The journey was pleasant as we circled around the foot of Table Mountain, passing by some beautiful flowers. Due to my poor geography skills, I had never fully grasped that Cape Town is situated on a peninsula. So, I was taken aback when I stepped off the train and found myself staring at the sea once again. The sight of people enjoying the water was truly delightful.",1
"“I demanded it,” gasped Tuppence. “She was just being escorted home to some high-ranking official.”   “How did you manage that?”   “I paid a visit to his residence,” said Julius. “I mentioned that in my opinion, a vehicle like that was valued at twenty thousand dollars. Then I made it clear that it held a personal value of around fifty thousand dollars to me if he exited the car.”   “And then?” said Tuppence, intrigued.   “And then,” replied Julius, “he exited the car, that’s all.”   The following two days passed without incident. Tuppence had received a succinct response to her plea from Mr. Carter. He highlighted that the Young Adventurers had taken on the task voluntarily, fully aware of the risks involved.",1

But let it go!"" With a casual shrug, he let go of whatever troubled him. I could have warned him that his fixation on the coffee would lead nowhere, but I held my words. Despite his age, Poirot was once a renowned figure in his prime.",1
"""Are you serious?"" ""Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds."" ""How long had he been dead?"" Dr. Durand provided the answer. ""I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have occurred at least seven, and possibly ten hours earlier."" ""Hm, so between midnight and 3 a.m."" ""Precisely, and Madame Renauld’s testimony places it after 2 a.m. which further narrows down the time frame. Death was instant and clearly not self-inflicted.""",1
"""The identity of your friends will determine our next steps."" Without a word, the man pulled out a cigarette case, removed four cigarettes, and placed them on the table before swiftly returning them to the case and back into his pocket.

""They propose, sir, that you utilize your remarkable skills in solving real crimes and return to your previous line of work, focusing on the mysteries of high society in London."" ""A rather peaceful proposition,"" noted Poirot. ""And if I decline?"" The man gestured expressively. ""We would, naturally, be greatly disappointed,"" he replied.",1
"At the window, a large roll-top desk was covered in scattered papers where the master of the house sat. Upon their arrival, he stood up. ""Do you have a message for me? Ah,"" he greeted Tuppence with a smile, ""it's you, isn't it? Bringing a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer, I presume?"" ""Not quite,"" Tuppence replied. ""Actually, I only used that as an excuse to gain entry. Oh, and this is Mr. Hersheimmer, Sir James Peel Edgerton."" ""Nice to meet you,"" the American said, extending his hand. ""Please, have a seat,"" Sir James offered, pulling out two chairs.",1
"As I glanced at him, a sense of deja vu washed over me. His face triggered a memory, but I dismissed it quickly. Glancing down at my watch, I realized time was slipping away. With a swift turn, I headed towards Cape Town. Spotting a tram about to depart, I sprinted to catch it. Footsteps echoed behind me, growing louder. I leaped onto the tram, closely followed by the other runner. It was him - the man from the night before, the one with the distinctive nose. The pieces fell into place - the encounter at the station, the untied shoe on the road. The puzzle was coming together in a rather unexpected way.",1
"The flowers arrangements had defied the usual seasons, mixing blooms that belonged to different times of the year. The guest list was exclusive and compact. Among the attendees were the American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had introduced his long-time friend, Sir William Beresford, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, the daring duo of Miss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and of course, the esteemed guest of honor, Miss Jane Finn. Julius had gone to great lengths to ensure Jane made a grand entrance. A mysterious knock on the door of the apartment shared by Tuppence and the American girl had set the events in motion.",1
"""And lo and behold, within the fireplace lay the very same quartet of coal knobs I had meticulously scattered there. Poirot caught sight of my observation. ""Ah, but of course, that was a stroke of genius on your part, along with the volumes.

After some persuasion, he revealed that the lady in question seemed unafraid, suggesting it was all part of a harmless prank or bet. Slowly but surely, I extracted all the details from him.""",1
"Tommy gently caressed his own head, lost in a world of fantasy. Suddenly, a brilliant notion sparked in his mind. Instead of just imagining, why not make it real? It was clear that Conrad was the true occupant of the residence. The rest, aside from the bearded German, only visited as a meeting point. So, why not lay in wait for Conrad behind the door, and upon his arrival, swiftly strike him with a chair or one of the old paintings. Of course, caution would be taken not to inflict severe harm.",1
"She felt trapped from all sides, a sense of dread creeping in. ""If they believe we're heading to Sir James,"" she confided in Jane, ""it will throw them off. Let them think we're going to Mr. Carter instead. His estate lies somewhere north of London."" As they crossed Holborn, a traffic jam brought their taxi to a halt. seizing the opportunity, Tuppence urged, ""Hurry, open the door on the right!"" Without hesitation, the two of them exited into the busy street. Within moments, they found themselves in a new taxi, heading back towards Carlton House Terrace. ""That should confuse them,"" Tuppence remarked smugly.",1
"With growing irritation, he struggled to make out any additional details; catching only snippets of conversation when voices rose, fueling his curiosity even more. His gaze lingered on the door handle, contemplating the possibility of turning it slowly and discreetly enough to avoid detection. After careful consideration, he concluded that it was indeed feasible. Gradually, barely shifting it an inch at a time, he maneuvered the handle with utmost caution, hardly daring to breathe. As he inched it further, he wondered if it would ever reach its limit. Finally, it refused to turn any more.",1
"Somebody always talks! ""Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. He carried the precious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that particular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing.

"""Did you know,"" I suddenly interjected, ""that Guy Pagett was present in Marlow when the murder took place?"" ""That changes everything. I was under the impression he was in Cannes with Sir Eustace."" ""He was believed to be in Florence but it turns out he never actually traveled there. My hunch is that he was indeed in Marlow, although I lack concrete evidence."" ""It's unbelievable that I never suspected Pagett until the night he attempted to push you off the boat. He's quite the talented actor."" ""Indeed, he is."" ""This would explain why the Mill House was selected. Pagett likely had the ability to enter and exit without being noticed.""",1
"An incredible change had overtaken my companion. His eyes sparkled with anticipation, his chest expanded with pride. ""I've been foolish, my companions! But now I see the light."" Major Norman hurried to the exit. ""I'll fetch the car."" ""That won't be necessary. I won't be using it. Thankfully, the storm has passed."" ""Are you planning to walk, sir?"" ""No, my dear friend. I am not St. Peter. I choose to voyage across the ocean by ship."" ""Across the ocean?"" ""Indeed. To proceed systematically, one must start from the beginning. And the genesis of this case was in England. Therefore, we must return to England.""",1
"Tuppence pondered the contents of that safe again, wondering if anything had been found. The events of last night replayed in her mind, each detail carefully examined. Sir James's cryptic words seemed to be connected somehow. Suddenly, a wave of realization hit her, draining the color from her face. Her eyes widened in shock as she muttered, ""It can't be true. I must be losing my mind to even consider such a possibility."" Despite its monstrous nature, the idea seemed to make sense of everything. After a brief pause, she sat down to compose a note, carefully choosing each word.",1
"""The crime must have taken place approximately two hours later, giving anyone who left on that train a solid alibi!"" ""Brilliant, Hastings! You've got it!"" I jumped to my feet. ""We need to check with the station. They surely couldn't have missed two strangers leaving on that train! Let's go immediately!"" ""Do you really think so, Hastings?"" ""Absolutely. We should head there right now."" Poirot gently held me back with a touch on my arm. ""Go ahead if you must, my friend, but if you do, I wouldn't bother asking about those two strangers.""",1
"""I know where the diamonds are,"" I declared confidently. Sir Eustace's eyes widened in surprise. ""Where?"" he demanded eagerly. ""In a safe place, far away from here,"" I replied mysteriously. ""But I can take you to them, if you agree to let Harry and I go free."" Sir Eustace hesitated, then nodded. ""Deal,"" he said. I led the way out of the room, with Sir Eustace following closely behind. As we walked down the corridor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of triumph. I had outsmarted the cunning criminal and saved the day. The diamonds were safe, and Harry and I were free at last. It was a satisfying end to a dangerous game of cat and mouse.",1
"""Please, don't be upset! Let me focus on my coffee, while you enjoy your cocoa. Deal?"" His quirky sense of humor made me chuckle, and we headed to the drawing-room. The coffee-cups and tray were exactly as we had left them. Poirot asked me to recount the events from the previous night, paying close attention to the position of the cups. ""Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray and poured. Then she joined you and Mademoiselle Cynthia by the window. Here are the three cups.""",1
"I have always been inclined to view work as something that should be taken on with a light and airy touch, if at all! Guy Pagett, on the other hand, is a man of seriousness and dedication. His lack of frivolity makes him a challenging companion. When I suggested he go to Florence, he eagerly accepted, despite the unusual timing. His devotion to guidebooks and galleries made it a worthwhile investment for me. However, our peace was shattered when he informed me of a murder in my house, involving a foreign woman. This unexpected turn of events has led me to reconsider my plans and embark on a new journey.",1
"""I was in the neighborhood, yes. Sir Eustace has not already told you? I hoped he had not recognized me, but from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is only too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, with an abnormal sense of humor. It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts.""",1
"""Furthermore, there is additional evidence that, prior to his demise, he was engaged in a romantic entanglement with a French woman, known as Madame Daubreuil, who resides in the neighboring Villa. Can you believe that this is the same man who, as you claim, had no interest in women's company?"" The secretary's gaze sharpened. ""Wait a minute, Judge. You're on the wrong track. I was acquainted with Paul Renauld. What you are suggesting is simply not possible. There must be some other explanation."" The judge shrugged. ""Then what alternative explanation do you propose?"" ""On what basis do you conclude it was a romantic relationship?"" ""Madame Daubreuil would frequently visit him here in the evenings.""",1
"Nonetheless, the case came back to me with surprising clarity. It had caused quite a stir in the past, extensively covered in the English newspapers. Remembering the key details required little effort on my part. In my current state of exhilaration, everything seemed to fall into place. I must confess, I tend to act on impulse, a habit that Poirot often criticizes. However, in this particular instance, I believe my hastiness was justified. The way in which this new revelation aligned with Poirot’s perspective was truly remarkable. Without hesitation, I turned to Poirot and exclaimed, “Congratulations, Poirot.""",1
"""You know, I have feelings for someone else,"" I admitted. His response was a simple, ""I understand."" I hesitated before confessing, ""It didn't start out that way when we met on the Kilmorden."" His next words carried a weight I had never felt before, ""I see."" His expression was stern, a stark contrast to his usual demeanor. ""What are you trying to say?"" I asked, my voice wavering. His gaze was intense, commanding. ""I now know what needs to be done,"" he declared. His declaration sent a chill down my spine, his resolve both mysterious and unsettling.",1
"I attended a somber and heartfelt service, where an overwhelming amount of flowers were displayed. People from all walks of life contributed, highlighting the impact my friend had in his new home.

"Bronsen was obligated to contact me. They would bide their time until the contact was made and then strike forcefully. There was no point in denying the obvious truth. ""Indeed,"" I replied. ""I did receive a message."" ""You must bring him, understood? Bring him immediately."" I clenched my jaws, feeling helpless. I ascended the stairs once more.

Unfortunately, the letters had been destroyed, leaving them with no further clues. Lady Yardly decided to leave, entrusting Captain Hastings with the information to relay to Poirot. When Poirot returned, he seemed intrigued by the developments and decided to involve Lord Yardly in the investigation.

Lord Yardly, a cheerful and somewhat simple man, was puzzled by the situation, seeking answers from Poirot.",1

With no other choice, I cautiously made my way up to the attic, tightly securing my restraints before laying back down on the cold floor. I stayed still, anticipating the possibility of being discovered. Thankfully, no one came to investigate. After what seemed like an eternity, I cautiously descended the staircase, only to find the Kafir standing watch by the door, his gentle humming filling the air. Feeling trapped, I retreated back to the attic once more. It was evident that the Kafir was determined to keep a close eye on me throughout the night.

They claim you disembarked from the 11:40 train."" Jack Renauld hesitated briefly, then resolved to speak. ""And if I did? Surely you're not suggesting I had a hand in my father's demise?"" His tone was proud, chin lifted. ""I demand to know why you are here."" ""It's quite straightforward. I came to visit my betrothed, Mademoiselle Daubreuil.""",1
"I followed him willingly as we approached the Mansions, a stately group of buildings meticulously maintained. A porter, adorned in uniform, was basking in the sunlight at the entrance. Poirot inquired of him: ""Excuse me, do Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?"" The porter, a curt man with a hint of suspicion, barely glanced in our direction and replied gruffly: ""No. 4. Second floor."" ""Thank you. And may I ask how long they have been living here?"" ""Six months."" Shocked, I took a step forward, only to be met with Poirot's sly smile. ""That can't be right,"" I protested. ""You must be mistaken.""",1
"""Absolutely,"" I stated, thoroughly entertained. ""You truly believe that if you found yourself involved in a crime, perhaps a homicide, you would immediately recognize the perpetrator?"" ""Without a doubt. I may not be able to demonstrate it to a group of attorneys. However, I am confident that I would recognize them. I would sense it in my fingertips if they approached me."" ""It could potentially be a 'she',"" I proposed. ""Possibly. But murder is a brutal crime. I associate it more with a man."" ""Not necessarily in a situation involving poisoning,"" Mrs. Cavendish interjected with her distinct voice. ""Dr.",1
"""As we returned to the flat, Poirot's expression changed. He leaned in and whispered, 'A man of method is at play here.' I couldn't help but ask, 'The murderer, or Count Foscatini?' Poirot's response was cryptic, 'The latter was certainly meticulous. Even in his plea for help and prediction of his demise, he made sure to delicately place the telephone receiver back in its cradle.' His words sparked a realization in me, 'You suspect poison?' I gasped. Poirot's smile was enigmatic. We entered the flat to find the local inspector and two constables waiting for us.""",1
"He was covered in a thick layer of dust and mud, his gaunt face a stark contrast. After a brief moment of staring, he collapsed. Poirot rushed to his side, then turned to me urgently. ""Quick, brandy."" I poured some into a glass and handed it to him. Poirot administered a small amount, then we lifted him onto the couch. Within minutes, he regained consciousness, his gaze vacant. ""What do you need, sir?"" Poirot inquired. The man's lips parted, his voice mechanical. ""M. Hercule Poirot, 14 Farraway Street."" ""That is me,"" Poirot confirmed. The man repeated, still uncomprehending: ""M.""",1
"""Something in her testimony has made me realize my error. Dorcas was right all along. The argument did occur in the afternoon, around four o’clock, just as she had stated.” I observed him intently. His fixation on this detail had always puzzled me. “Indeed, many strange things came to light today,” Poirot added. “And what about Dr. Bauerstein? Why was he fully dressed and awake at such an early hour? It baffles me that no one found this suspicious.” “I believe he suffers from insomnia,” I suggested hesitantly. “Which could be a plausible explanation, or a cover-up for something more sinister,” Poirot pointed out. “It is a convenient excuse that reveals nothing. I will be keeping a close watch on our cunning Dr.""",1
"""They were impressed by his serious demeanor, making Tuppence feel less embarrassed about her nerves. Suddenly, Julius pointed out Tuppence's clever son. He decided to go down and reassure the young boy. Tuppence inquired about how Julius gained access. He explained that Albert had called him, prompting him to rush over with Sir James. The boy had been anxiously waiting for them, concerned about Tuppence's well-being. He had been eavesdropping outside the flat door, but heard nothing.""",1
"”Poirot handed me an old, worn-out book with the title, Ancient Rites and Rituals of the Occult. Without a word, he swiftly left the tent. The doctor turned to me, puzzled. “What’s his scheme now?” I chuckled at the familiar phrase coming from someone else’s mouth. “I’m not quite sure,” I admitted. “I think he’s planning to banish the dark forces somehow.” Determined to find out more, I sought out Poirot and discovered him deep in conversation with the gaunt young man who used to work for the deceased Mr. Bleibner. “No,” Mr.",1
"""And, without naming names, there is an individual in this residence who none of us could tolerate! A dark day it was when he first set foot inside."" Poirot patiently waited for her anger to dissipate, then, adopting a professional demeanor, inquired: ""Now, regarding this altercation? When did you first become aware of it?"" ""Sir, I happened to be walking down the hallway yesterday."" ""At what time?"" ""I cannot pinpoint the exact time, but it was definitely not during tea-time. Possibly around four o’clock or slightly after.""",1
"""And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no such person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says."" ""It was Dickens,"" I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. ""But what do you mean, Poirot?"" ""I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.""",1
"""When she finally confessed to the murder, I thought it was the end of it. But something didn't sit right with me. I revisited the case and came to the same conclusion - it had to be either Bella Duveen or Marthe Daubreuil. The letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie gave me the breakthrough I needed. The missing dagger, stolen by Dulcie Duveen, revealed the true culprit. With some discreet guidance, the pieces fell into place and Marthe Daubreuil's true colors were exposed. It was a risky move, but it paid off. The events unfolded just as I had anticipated, and Marthe Daubreuil's attempt to claim the Renauld fortune was thwarted.""",1
"Inglethorp always ordered a large quantity of medicine from Coot’s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. The amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem was so significant that she would have needed to consume nearly the entire bottle. The idea that the tonic played a role in her death is absurd. One juryman proposed that the chemist responsible for making the medicine could have made a mistake. The doctor acknowledged that this was a possibility.",1
"""They suspected it would be pointless to argue. “I can’t figure out,” the Prime-Minister interjected, “how that photo ended up in Mr. Hersheimmer’s drawer?” “Maybe it never left,” the lawyer proposed calmly. “But the fake inspector? Inspector Brown?” “Hmm,” Sir James pondered. Standing up, he said, “I shouldn’t keep you. Carry on with the country’s matters. I need to focus on my investigation.” Julius Hersheimmer came back from Manchester two days later. A message from Tommy awaited him: “DEAR HERSHEIMMER, “Apologies for losing my cool. Farewell if we don’t meet again.""",1
"""Pardon me, sir?"" Poirot inquired. ""Do you possess knowledge of your mother's true identity?"" Marthe stared at him briefly before breaking down in tears, her head sinking onto her arms. ""There, there,"" consoled Poirot, giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. ""Compose yourself, my dear, it seems you are aware. Now, a follow-up question, were you acquainted with M. Renauld?"" Marthe lifted her head, looking at him with confusion. ""M. Renauld,"" she repeated, puzzled. ""Ah, I perceive you are unaware of that. Allow me to explain."" Poirot proceeded to dissect the case, similar to how he had briefed me before our journey to England. Marthe listened intently, captivated by his every word.",1
"Poirot turned to us, his tone serious. ""Each criminal has his own method,"" he began, addressing us collectively. ""The police can often make a shrewd guess at the offender simply by the peculiar method he has employed."" Giraud, unimpressed, snorted at the suggestion of masked men. ""There have been many affairs,"" he retorted. ""These crimes all resemble each other more or less."" Poirot, undeterred, continued, ""There is such a thing as the individual touch.""",1
"I found myself enveloped in the mysterious aura of the Orient, full of twists, deceit, and danger. Out of nowhere, my companion pushed aside two barrels, revealing a narrow tunnel-like entrance in the wall. With a silent gesture, he urged me to proceed. The passage was cramped and I had to crouch as we made our way through. Eventually, it opened up into a corridor, leading us to yet another hidden cellar. Without hesitation, the man I followed knocked four times on a particular section of the wall. To my amazement, a secret door swung open, exposing a narrow doorway beyond.",1
"""Was it hallucinations or did he truly believe he was outside?"" Poirot's smile was enigmatic. ""Tell me, Japp, was it an accident or a calculated murder?"" The Inspector shifted uncomfortably. ""Without the bizarre curry incident, I would lean towards accident. It makes no sense to subject a conscious man to such torture, he would have surely screamed bloody murder."" Poirot's eyes widened. ""Ah, what a fool I've been. Utter imbecile! You have outsmarted me, Japp."" The Inspector was surprised by the rare praise, as Poirot was known for his self-congratulatory nature. A hint of redness crept up Japp's neck as he mumbled something about there still being room for doubt.",1
"""Money, that's what I'm after,"" Tuppence said with a smile. Whittington grunted in response, begrudgingly impressed. ""You played the part well. I thought you were just a simple-minded girl,"" he admitted. Tuppence philosophized, ""Life is full of unexpected turns."" Whittington persisted, ""Someone must have spilled. Not Rita, you claim. Then who? Come in."" A discreet knock interrupted their conversation as the clerk entered, placing a document within Whittington's reach.",1
"""Exploring this unfamiliar world had a certain allure, especially when I witnessed her animated expression light up while she spoke. Our journey took us through Amiens, triggering a flood of memories. It seemed as though my companion could read my thoughts. “Reflecting on the War?” I nodded in response. “You served, I presume?” “Yes, I did. I got injured once, and after the Somme, I was discharged. I had a temporary role in the Army for a while. Now, I work as a private secretary for an M.P.” “Impressive!” “Not really. It’s quite mundane, to be honest. I usually wrap up my work in a couple of hours each day. It’s not very stimulating either.",1
"Poirot's eyes narrowed as he stared at Dr. Ames, his green cat-like gaze unwavering. ""Do you not believe in Ancient Egypt, monsieur le docteur?"" he asked softly. Dr. Ames, taken aback, stammered for a response. Poirot, without waiting for an answer, inquired about the thoughts of the native workmen. ""I guess they're getting scared,"" Dr. Ames admitted. ""But they've no reason to be."" Poirot's expression remained inscrutable as Sir Guy expressed disbelief in Poirot's ideas. With a swift movement, Poirot produced a tattered book titled The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans. Without a word, he left the tent, leaving the doctor puzzled.",1
"""But his behavior at that moment was undeniably strange. Leaning in, he intentionally sprinkled salt around my plate in four separate piles. ""Please forgive me,"" he murmured sadly. ""Assisting someone with salt is said to bring them sorrow. It may be an inevitable fate. I pray that it is not. I hope you understand."" Then, with a meaningful gesture, he repeated the same action with the salt on his own plate. The symbolism of the number 4 was impossible to ignore. I studied him intently.""",1
"I could come back, unnoticed, and wreak havoc in their community. Nothing stood in the way of my immediate departure. I sent cables, secured my passage, and one week later I was boarding the Ansonia headed for Buenos Ayres. Just as the ship pulled away from the dock, a steward delivered a message to me. It was handed to him by a large man in a fur coat who had left the ship just before the gangway was raised. I read the note. It was short and direct. ""You made the right choice,"" it read. It was signed with a large number 4.",1
"I was certain that we were dealing with a representative of the infamous Big Four. Poirot seemed unimpressed by my theory initially, but changed his mind when I pointed out the man loitering near the hotel from my window. I advised Poirot to skip dinner, but he insisted on joining me. We arrived at the dining area late and were seated next to a window. Suddenly, a commotion caught our attention as china crashed to the ground. A plate of haricots verts had spilled on a man at the neighboring table. The head waiter rushed over, apologizing profusely.",1
"""He might have had,"" I answered thoughtfully, recalling our discussion after returning from the Matoppos. ""He’s a very powerful personality,"" I continued, ""but not at all my idea of the 'Colonel.' And, in any case, the notion is preposterous. He’s with the Secret Service."" ""But how can we be sure of that? It’s so easy to insinuate such things. No one refutes it, and the gossip spreads until it's accepted as absolute truth. It justifies all sorts of questionable actions. Anne, what’s your opinion on Race?"" ""I have mixed feelings,"" I replied.",1
"“I couldn’t sleep. I was restless, disturbed, had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream,” he explained. “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I inquired. He looked embarrassed. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death,” he responded with a tinge of bitterness.",1
"""Looks like another little picnic is in the cards soon,"" he mused, a faint smile playing on his lips. Annette's concern was palpable. ""Are you hurt?"" she asked urgently. ""Just a scratch,"" he reassured her. Suddenly, the girl leaped up. ""Stop the car! Let me out! They're after me, not you. Don't risk your lives for me. I won't allow it. Let me go!"" Frantically, she tried to open the door. Julius steadied her, meeting her eyes. There was no hint of a foreign accent in her voice. ""Relax, kid,"" he said softly. ""Your memory seems pretty sharp to me.""",1
"“But I need more information to fully understand the situation. So, let's start from the beginning. You mentioned going to Florence.” “Actually, I never went to Florence. That's the truth of it.” “Then where did you go?” “I went back home to Marlow.” “Why on earth would you go back to Marlow?” “To check on my wife. She was unwell and expecting” “Your wife? I had no idea you were married.” “Yes, Sir Eustace, that's the truth. I kept that from you.” “How long have you been married?” “Just a little over eight years. I was married for only six months when I started working as your secretary.”",1
"Ignoring the spiky pen and thick, black treacle provided by a generous Government, Tuppence instead reached for Tommy’s pencil, quickly jotting down: “No need for advertisement. Will clarify tomorrow.” She sent the note to Tommy at his club, where he faced potential resignation in just one month if luck didn't intervene. “Maybe he'll bite,” she whispered to herself. “At least it's worth a shot.” With a sense of purpose, she handed it to the clerk and headed home, pausing at a bakery to purchase three penny buns.",1
"I couldn't fathom why a conspirator would choose to represent thirteen in such an indirect way in real life. If the intention was to convey thirteen, why not simply write ""13""? The spacing between the digits was deliberate. So, I subtracted twenty-two from one hundred and seventy-one, arriving at one hundred and fifty-nine. After repeating the calculation, the result was a hundred and forty-nine. These mathematical exercises, while beneficial for sharpening the mind, proved fruitless in unraveling the mystery at hand. Setting aside arithmetic, I turned my attention to the words inscribed: Kilmorden Castle.",1
"After recounting the previous incidents, he continued: “Following a tip-off, Superintendent Summerhaye and I conducted a search of the suspect’s living quarters, while he was temporarily away from the residence. Inside his dresser, concealed beneath layers of clothing, we discovered: firstly, a set of gold-rimmed pince-nez spectacles identical to those belonging to Mr. Inglethorp” these were presented “secondly, this vial.” The vial was the same one identified earlier by the pharmacist’s assistant, a small container made of blue glass, holding a small amount of a white crystalline substance, and labeled: “Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.",1
"“Within the sprawling estate of your late uncle, lies a hidden fortune in cash or perhaps a secret will, with a deadline of one year for you to uncover it.” “Indeed, Monsieur Poirot; I trust in your superior skills to succeed where I have failed.” “Ah, how kind of you. Rest assured, my mind is ready for the challenge. Have you searched for it at all?” “Just a quick look around; but I have faith in my uncle's cunning to make it a difficult puzzle to solve.""",1
"""Yet, I know he can be found there. You may not comprehend now, but I will reveal everything in due time. Trust me, this trip to Paris is crucial. I won't be gone for long. Most likely, I'll be back by tomorrow. I don't suggest you come along. Stay here and watch over Giraud. Also, spend time with M. Renauld's son. And if you wish, try to win over Mademoiselle Marthe's affections. Though, I doubt you'll have much luck."" The final comment didn't sit well with me. ""Speaking of which,"" I mentioned.",1
"As soon as Quentin entered the room, his patient, Mr. Paynter, began to describe his unusual symptoms. Paynter claimed that he was not actually feeling sick, but rather had been alarmed by the taste of curry at dinner. He quickly disposed of the dish and asked Quentin to investigate.",1
"“You're telling me he was murdered yesterday morning?” “I connected it to the theft of the dagger,” Giraud clarified. “It's possible he was killed later in the day.” “Later in the day? Nonsense! This guy has been deceased for a minimum of forty-eight hours, maybe even longer.” We exchanged bewildered looks. The doctor's statement was so unexpected that we were momentarily stunned. A man was fatally stabbed with a dagger that had been reported stolen just a day ago, yet Dr. Durand insisted he had been dead for at least forty-eight hours! The situation was unbelievably bizarre.",1
"""He showed up today after being called by your husband."" With that, he removed the letter penned by M. Renauld from his coat pocket and passed it to the woman. She perused it with what seemed like genuine surprise. ""I was completely unaware of this. It seems he was well aware of the danger."" ""Madam, I must ask you to be honest with me. Is there any event from your husband's time in South America that could provide a clue to his murder?"" Mrs. Renauld pondered for a moment, then shook her head. ""I can't think of anything.""",1
"""I believe that covers everything, Sir Eustace, apart from a variety of miscellaneous items, such as a motor-veil and various gloves."" ""If you had any sense, Pagett, you would have realized right away that those items couldn't possibly be mine.""""I suspected that some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.""""Speaking of which, why did you choose such a questionable character to be my secretary?"" I recounted the intense questioning I had endured. Instantly regretting it, I noticed a familiar gleam in his eye. I quickly shifted the topic of conversation.",1
"""It seemed obvious, however, that Julius was willing to accept the absence of the other person. ""This seems like a simple situation,"" he commented. ""Just a game of hide-and-seek, nothing more."" ""I hope so,"" replied Sir James. ""Of course. What else could it be?"" ""You're still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. By the time you reach my age, you'll have learned an important lesson. 'Never underestimate your opponent.'"" Tommy was struck by the seriousness of his words, but Julius remained unfazed. ""Do you think Mr. Brown will intervene? If he does, I'm prepared."" He patted his pocket.",1
"She described how he had become involved in various political plots and mentioned certain crucial documents that had been given to him for safekeeping, involving a significant European ""secret"". Madame Beroldy had entrusted him with these papers to mislead those chasing them, but she felt anxious after spotting key figures from the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. Then, on November 28th, disaster struck. The maid who regularly tended to the Beroldys' home discovered the apartment door left ajar, ajar.",1
"""I appreciate your concern,"" I responded, trying to mask my frustration. ""Miss Emery, the governess, is resigning."" Mrs. Thompson, the employer, hesitated before asking, ""Since your search hasn't yielded results, would you consider staying on permanently?"" Surprised by the offer, I realized it was out of kindness rather than genuine desire. Overwhelmed with guilt for judging her unfairly, I rose from my seat and embraced her. ""You're too kind,"" I whispered gratefully. ""But I have plans to leave for South Africa this weekend."" My unexpected show of affection caught Mrs. Thompson off guard, unaccustomed to such displays.",1
"""My theory was quite absurd, suggesting that she had planned to poison him and somehow Mrs. Inglethorp consumed it by mistake. However, the method of execution remains a mystery. The whole scenario is preposterous and utterly far-fetched."" ""Nevertheless, you are correct in one aspect. It's prudent to suspect everyone until you can rationally and satisfactorily establish their innocence. So, what possible motives exist for Miss Howard to intentionally poison Mrs. Inglethorp?"" ""She adored her!"" I protested. ""Tut, tut!"" Poirot exclaimed impatiently. ""Your arguments are naive.""",1
"I couldn't stand not knowing the woman's name, so I decided to take a casual walk inside to search. Perhaps she was in the lounge. Merlinville was a small town with the beach as the main attraction. A casino was under construction, but not open yet. After scanning the beach with no luck, I concluded she must be in the hotel. Upon entering, I scanned the small lounge but didn't spot her. I checked other rooms, but she was nowhere to be found.",1
"Vandemeyer’s room was a mess, clothes strewn everywhere, a half-packed suitcase on the floor. Tuppence gathered her courage, her voice trembling slightly as she spoke. “You can’t shoot me,” she said firmly. “The whole building would hear.” Mrs. Vandemeyer just smiled. “As long as you stay quiet, you’ll be fine. You’re smart.”",1
"""Maybe,"" he remarked, pausing as a knock echoed through the room, ""this could be the opportunity we've been waiting for; it might just be our mysterious visitor."" I couldn't hide my disappointment as Inspector Japp and an unfamiliar man walked in. ""Good evening,"" greeted the Inspector. ""Let me introduce Captain Kent from the United States Secret Service."" Captain Kent, a stoic and towering American, had a face so expressionless it could have been chiseled from stone. ""Nice to make your acquaintance, gentlemen,"" he said quietly, giving a stiff handshake.",1
"""Tell me what happened in your own words,"" the detective demanded. The suspect, of average height, had a face that was far from pleasing. He had the air of a criminal. ""I swear I'm innocent,"" he pleaded. ""Someone planted those glass figurines in my belongings. It was a setup. I went straight home after arriving, just like I told you. I had no idea until Betsy screamed. I swear, I had nothing to do with it."" The detective stood up. ""If you can't be honest with me, then we're finished.""",1
"His corpse was discovered in the shed adjacent to the crime scene, having succumbed at least two days prior. It is highly likely that he suffered a stabbing wound akin to M. Renauld, although not necessarily to the rear."" I was taken aback and taken aback I was. Throughout my experience with Poirot, he had never executed something as astonishing as this. And, almost inevitably, a suspicion crept into my thoughts. ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""you're teasing me. You must have already been informed."" He fixed his sincere gaze on me disapprovingly. ""Would I stoop to such deceit? I can assure you that I am completely uninformed.""",1
"""I appreciate your honesty.""  ""Can't I consider you a friend as well?"" ""I'm not a reliable friend."" ""What makes you say that?"" ""It's the truth. I can be charming one day and completely indifferent the next."" I don't know what came over me, but I felt irritated, and I spoke impulsively and somewhat rudely: ""Yet you always seem to be charming with Dr. Bauerstein!"" Immediately, I wished I could take back my words. Her expression hardened. It was as if a steel barrier had descended, hiding the true woman from view.",1
"He made his way to the boathouse, changed into his disguise that had been cleverly stashed away, disposed of his original clothes in the water, and proceeded with his scheme by selling the ring in a conspicuous manner, then instigating a scuffle with a police officer, ensuring his retreat to the sanctuary of Bow Street, a place no one would think to search for him! ""It's inconceivable,"" Japp muttered. ""Just ask Madame,"" my companion replied with a grin. The following morning, a certified letter awaited Poirot at his spot at the table. Upon opening it, a five-pound note slipped out. A look of concern creased my companion's forehead.",1
"""Don’t worry, Mr. Poirot will guide me,"" she reassured the group as they exited the room. Poirot gestured for me to follow him upstairs. He grasped my arm and pulled me aside. ""Hurry, go to the opposite wing. Wait on this side of the baize door. Stay put until I return."" With that, he quickly rejoined the detectives. I obeyed his orders, standing by the baize door, curious about the mystery awaiting me.",1
"A message from Poirot greeted me as I sat down to breakfast the next day: “It is clear that the man with the black beard was not Havering, only you or Japp would entertain such a notion. Send me details about the housekeeper and her attire this morning, as well as Mrs. Havering's. Skip the interior photographs - they lack artistry.” I found Poirot's tone needlessly sarcastic. It seemed to me that he might be envious of my advantage in being on site to handle the investigation. While his request for clothing descriptions struck me as absurd, I obliged as best as a mere man could.",1
"Tuppence was determined to give it a try, despite her nerves. Meeting Julius on her afternoon out, she convinced him to join her in confronting the lion in his den. Julius needed some coaxing, but Tuppence stood her ground. ""It can't hurt,"" she reasoned. Eventually, Julius relented, and they set off to Carlton House Terrace in their car. As they arrived, a flawless butler greeted them at the door, making Tuppence feel slightly anxious. Maybe it was audacious of her, after all.",1
"Cavendish. “Apologies, madame, for bringing up distressing memories, but I have a slight notion,” Poirot’s “notions” were gaining a reputation “and would like to pose a few questions.” “To me? Of course.” “You are too kind, madame. What I wish to inquire about is this: the door connecting Mrs. Inglethorp’s room to Mademoiselle Cynthia’s, it was locked, correct?” “Indeed it was locked,” responded Mary Cavendish, somewhat taken aback. “I mentioned that at the inquest.” “Locked?” “Yes.” She appeared puzzled. “I mean,” clarified Poirot, “you are certain it was locked, and not just bolted?” “Ah, I understand now. No, I am not sure.",1
"""Wherever we have encountered his footprints, he has consistently taken on a supporting role. Another individual steps into the spotlight. Yet without fail, we uncover the presence of a seemingly insignificant figure, like a servant or a clerk, lingering in the shadows, while the enigmatic Mr. Brown slips through our fingers once more.""  Tuppence gasped. ""I can't help but wonder...""  ""What is it?""   ""I recall in Mr. Whittington's office. The clerk, he referred to him as Brown. Could it be?""  Carter pondered, nodding. ""It's quite possible. It's peculiar that the name is frequently referenced. A quirk of a mastermind.""",1
"Tommy's mind raced as he stared into her wide hazel eyes, the color of sunbeams. ""Are you Jane Finn?"" he blurted out. The girl, named Annette, shook her head softly. ""My name is Annette, monsieur,"" she replied in broken English. ""Française?"" Tommy asked. ""Oui, monsieur,"" she confirmed. Tommy chuckled. ""I don't speak French for long,"" he admitted. ""Is that breakfast?"" The girl nodded. Tommy got up from the bed to examine the tray - a loaf, margarine, and coffee. ""Not quite the Ritz,"" he muttered.",1
"""No need to be upset, Anne. I was just joking around. Come sit here. Putting jokes aside, I believe you've stumbled upon something crucial. We've always assumed Pagett had an alibi. Now we know he doesn't."" ""Exactly,"" I replied. ""We need to keep a close watch on him."" ""And on everyone else too,"" she added with a hint of regret. ""Actually, that's one of the topics I wanted to discuss with you. That, and our finances. Please, don't act all high and mighty. I understand you value your pride and independence, but you need to consider some practicality in this matter.""",1
"“Let's go and check the coffee cups,” he said.  “My dear Poirot! What's the point now that we know about the cocoa?” I replied.  “That dreadful cocoa!” Poirot exclaimed. He chuckled, seemingly amused, throwing his hands up in mock despair, a gesture that I found quite distasteful.  “And besides,” I added coolly, “since Mrs. Inglethorp took her coffee to her room, I fail to see what you hope to uncover, unless you anticipate finding a vial of poison on the coffee tray!”  Poirot's demeanor quickly turned serious. “Let's focus, my friend,” he said, linking arms with me.",1
"Poirot was the one to reveal the shocking truth to Jack Renauld about his father's past as a fugitive from justice. After learning the truth, Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and his secretary Stonor. Jack struggled with the idea of asking the girl who loved him to join him, but Poirot encouraged him to be honest and see what she would say. In the end, Jack found the courage to approach her as a man ready for a new beginning. As for Captain Hastings, he preferred to reminisce about a morning in the garden rather than join the Renaulds on their journey.",1
"Monsieur Hautet turned to us and spoke, ""Our task here is completed. Monsieur Renauld, I invite you to review the evidence as it is presented to you. I have intentionally kept the proceedings informal. While some may call my methods original, I firmly believe in the value of thinking outside the box. The investigation is now in the capable hands of the esteemed Monsieur Giraud. I have full confidence that he will excel in his pursuit of justice. Madame, please accept my sincere condolences. Gentlemen, I bid you farewell.""",1
"""Shortly thereafter, I heard a commotion in the residence that seemed to have spooked them, leading to my husband being forcibly taken into my quarters in a state of undress."" ""Excuse me,"" Poirot interjected, ""is there no other way out of the dressing room?"" ""No, sir, only a door connecting to my room. They rushed my husband inside, the shorter man leading the way, the taller one following closely with a dagger in hand. Paul attempted to reach me, his eyes filled with anguish. He pleaded with his abductors. 'I need to talk to her,' he insisted.""",1
"At this point, I am certain that you have transformed from Anne Beddingfeld to Lady Eardsley, residing in Park Lane. I want to assure you that I hold no grudge against you. Starting anew at my age is a challenge, but between us, I had a small savings set aside for such circumstances. It has proven to be quite helpful as I am building a new network. And if you happen to encounter your peculiar friend, Arthur Minks, please inform him that he is not forgotten. It will surely catch him off guard.

"""He's heading out of Cape Town today, to meet Sir Eustace in Johannesburg,"" she mentioned casually. I nodded, processing the information. ""And the children, where are they?"" I inquired. ""Most likely with Sir Eustace,"" she replied. After contemplating for a moment, I finally spoke up, ""It's a tricky situation, but I believe it's best to hold off for now."" Suzanne grinned at me knowingly, ""You're not one for inactivity, are you, Anne?"" I chuckled, ""Not my preferred state, no."" Determined to take action, I decided to retrieve a train schedule to determine when Guy Pagett's train would be passing through Kimberley. It was scheduled to arrive at 5.",1

By carefully crafting the structure of the story and the interactions between the characters, I aim to create a gripping tale that keeps the reader guessing until the very end.",1
"""There was a brief period when we were not all in the same place, prompting the need to summon Monsieur Lawrence to the balcony."" ""I had overlooked that,"" I confessed. ""It was a fleeting moment."" ""Fleeting, yet significant."" ""Significant in what way?"" Poirot's smile took on a cryptic quality. ""Significant enough for a man with a background in medicine to indulge in a common interest and curiosity."" Our gazes locked. Poirot's were pleasantly unfocused. He rose from his seat and began to hum a tune. I observed him warily.",1
"I had just finished my morning shower and was daydreaming about breakfast when I heard Japp's voice coming from the living room. Quickly throwing on a bathrobe, I made my way in. ""You've really outdone yourself this time,"" Japp exclaimed. ""It's quite disappointing, M. Poirot. I've never seen you make a mistake like this before."" Poirot's expression was priceless. Japp continued, ""We were so focused on the Black Hand case, only to discover it was the footman all along."" ""The footman?"" I exclaimed in disbelief. ""Yes, James, or whatever he goes by.""",1
"""I have no intention of dressing you in frocks. I'm more inclined to rip them off of you. You belong to me, understand? If I let you go, I might lose you. I'm bringing you with me tonight, no matter what anyone says."" He embraced me tightly, kissing me deeply. ""I can't be without you any longer, Anne. I despise this wealth. Let Race take it. Come with me. Let's leave."" ""But my toothbrush?"" I hesitated. ""You can buy a new one. I know I'm crazy, but please, come with me!"" He stormed off in a rage.",1
"“Regardless,” she continued, sparring with an invisible adversary, “I doubt he knows. He would never admit it. I’ve consistently rejected sentimentality, yet here I am, more sentimental than anyone. How foolish girls can be! That’s always been my belief. I may end up sleeping with his picture under my pillow, dreaming of him all night. It’s terrible to realize you’ve betrayed your own principles.” Tuppence sadly shook her head, reflecting on her lapse. “I don’t know what to tell Julius, honestly. I feel so foolish! I’ll need to provide an explanation; he’s so American and thorough, he won’t accept anything less.”",1
"""Get going immediately.” “Make sure to bundle up, sir,” the young aviator advised. “I can offer you a coat, if needed.” Poirot checked his bulky timepiece. He muttered under his breath: “Just enough time, just enough.” Then, he raised his head and courteously nodded to the young man. “I appreciate it, sir. However, I am not the one you will be flying. This gentleman here is your passenger.” With those words, he stepped aside, allowing a figure to emerge from the shadows. It was the second male captive who had departed in the alternate vehicle, and as his face was illuminated, I couldn't help but gasp in disbelief.",1
"I have no patience for foreigners in general, but according to the newspapers, these brave Belgians are not your typical foreigners. He certainly carries himself like a well-mannered gentleman,"" I said to myself as I listened to Dorcas. She was a true example of the traditional servant, a dying breed. I decided to head down to the village to find Poirot, but before I could even leave, I crossed paths with him on his way to the house. Without hesitation, I relayed Dorcas's message to him.",1
"""I halted the lively chat to assert my refusal to become a victim, causing Ingles to depart soon after. We walked in silence until Poirot unexpectedly mentioned bringing his brother into the situation. ""Your brother?"" I exclaimed, taken aback. ""I had no idea you had a brother."" ""You astonish me, Hastings.""",1
"""Consider this,"" I began, leaning in closer to my colleague. ""The evidence strongly suggests that Madame Daubreuil was not the mastermind behind it all. Instead, we must entertain the possibility that Georges Conneau orchestrated the entire scheme. Yes, that's it. Georges Conneau and Madame Renauld working together to commit the crime. But lurking in the shadows, there is a mysterious individual, operating under an unknown alias. Let's retrace our steps in the Renauld Case, starting from the very beginning. Do you have your notebook handy? Excellent. Now, what is the initial event we should document?"" ""The letter you received?"" ""While that was our first clue, it doesn't mark the true genesis of this investigation.",1
"I couldn't just take her word for it, especially since she was the one who claimed the door was locked. There was too much chaos for anyone to know for sure if she had actually bolted it. I decided to investigate further. The torn fragment I found matched perfectly with a piece missing from Mrs. Cavendish's armlet. Additionally, during the inquest, Mrs. Cavendish mentioned hearing a table fall in her room from her own bed. To confirm her story, I stationed my friend Monsieur Hastings near her door in the left wing of the building.",1
"The timing of 'the Western Star' showing up on the same day caught my attention immediately. Everything seems to be going smoothly for Lord Yardly as he gets ready to retire. But then the threat of the diamond being sold emerges. The switch will eventually be uncovered. She undoubtedly sends an urgent message to Gregory Rolf, who has recently returned to England. He reassures her by guaranteeing to handle everything and plans for a two-fold theft.",1
"""Damn it all, man,"" shouted Gregory Rolf, leaning in, ""do you see it now?"" The man glanced up at him and flinched. ""No, sir,"" he replied. ""I can't say that I do."" And in truth, there was nothing remotely exotic about the sincere brown eyes staring back at us. The detective grunted. ""Confident fellow. Expected the eyes to draw attention, so he took a bold approach to throw off suspicion. Must have shadowed you from the hotel and struck as soon as you were out of sight."" ""And what of the jewel case?"" I inquired. ""It was discovered in a hotel corridor.""",1
"“Have you calmed down now and are you ready to share what's really going on?” I inquired. He hesitated, then replied, “I'm afraid I can't indulge your curiosity at the moment.” Disappointed, I pressed, “And why is that?” He smirked sardonically. “If you want something spread around, just tell a woman. Otherwise, keep quiet.” Feeling slighted, I retorted, “Are you implying I can't keep a secret?” His response was noncommittal. Rising from his seat, he remarked, “In any case, you'll likely have plenty to say about tonight's events.” Outraged, I exclaimed, “How dare you!”",1
"But the burning question that consumed his thoughts was whether he could successfully escape his restraints. Carefully, he began to slide the sharp blade back and forth against the rope that held his hands together. Despite the searing pain as the knife pierced his skin, he persisted in his efforts. Gradually, the cord loosened, allowing him to free his hands. Once liberated, he struggled to stand due to the stiffness in his limbs. After tending to his wounded wrist, he settled on the bed to contemplate his next move.",1
"""But, naturally, it all falls into place if he's an heir who has vanished. Is it a title, Mr. Poirot?"" ""Regrettably, just an inheritance,"" Poirot stated without hesitation. ""However, it could come down to identification. That's why it's crucial for us to locate someone who was very familiar with him. You were close to him, correct, mademoiselle."" ""I have no issue sharing that with you, Mr. Poirot. You are a gentleman. You understand how to properly cater to a lady, unlike some of these disrespectful youngsters nowadays. Completely rude, if you ask me. As I was mentioning, you being a Frenchman, won't be offended.""",1
"He couldn't remember the last time he had worn them. Where were they stored? Sometimes in one spot, sometimes in another. The shovel was typically in the small tool shed. Was it secured? Naturally it was locked. Where was the key hidden? Ah, it was in the door naturally! There was nothing worth stealing. Who would anticipate a gang of thieves, of murderers? Such events never occurred during Madame la Vicomtesse's era. Mr. Hautet indicating he was done, the elderly man left, grumbling all the way.",1
"What was the reason she stayed there? Was it in the hopes of encountering Jack Renauld? I had informed her (believing it at the time) that he was traveling to Buenos Ayres by sea. Perhaps she knew that the Anzora had not departed. But in order to be aware of that, she must have seen Jack. Was this what Poirot was investigating? Had Jack Renauld, coming back to meet Marthe Daubreuil, unexpectedly run into Bella Duveen, the woman he had callously abandoned? It was starting to make sense. If that was the situation, it could provide Jack with the alibi he was searching for. However, his silence in that case appeared to be quite puzzling.",1
"""Is this for my father?"" He asked, his voice filled with emotion and indignation. ""Yes, we discovered it in his coat pocket."" ""Do you know who sent it?"" He paused, glancing briefly at his mother. The magistrate caught on. ""Not yet. Any thoughts on the sender?"" ""I'm clueless,"" M. Hautet admitted. ""A truly baffling case. Well, I guess we can eliminate the letter as a lead now. Your thoughts, M. Giraud?"" ""It's a dead end,"" the detective confirmed.",1
"“How can I deal with a secretary like that? His face is an unpleasant shade of yellow, not a good match for a black eye. I'm done with secretaries unless I find a nice girl, someone with gentle eyes who will comfort me when I'm upset. What do you say, Miss Anne? Are you up for the job?"" ""How often will I need to comfort you?"" I inquired, chuckling. ""All day long,"" Sir Eustace flirtatiously replied. ""I won't get much work done if that's the case,"" I teased. ""That's alright. This workload is all Pagett's doing. He's working me to the bone.""",1
"A clever plan, well-executed. The idea of using bromides was truly brilliant! However, caution is key. We must be extremely careful. Suddenly, the letter ends abruptly. It's clear the writer was stopped mid-thought, but there's no doubt about who it was. We are all familiar with this handwriting. A piercing cry, close to a scream, shattered the quiet. ""You fiend! How did you manage to obtain it?"" A chair was flung to the ground. Poirot deftly dodged to the side. With a swift motion, his attacker tumbled to the floor with a loud thud.",1
"He refused to leave her behind. Suddenly, there was a commotion above, a cry from the German, followed by Annette's voice, loud and clear: ""Mon Dieu, he's free! And fast! Who could have guessed?"" Tommy remained frozen in place. Was that a signal for him to depart? It seemed like it. Then, even louder, the words descended upon him: ""This house is cursed. I long for Marguerite. For Marguerite. For Marguerite!"" Tommy dashed back towards the staircase. She was urging him to flee without her. But why? He had to find a way to bring her along, no matter what. But his hopes plummeted. Conrad was hurtling down the stairs, letting out a fierce roar as he caught sight of Tommy.",1
"“Ah!” exclaimed the elderly man, studying him intensely. “You must be my nephew, correct? Not the most impressive appearance, but you seem to have accomplished quite a bit. Your mother must have raised you well. How about we bury the hatchet, hmm? You are my successor, and going forward I plan to provide you with a stipend and consider Chalmers Park your residence.” “I appreciate that, sir, it’s very generous of you.” “Where is this young woman I’ve heard so much about?” Tommy presented Tuppence. “Ah!” remarked Sir William, observing her. “Women nowadays are not like they were in my youth.” “Actually, they are,” retorted Tuppence.",1
"“Shall we go to the Ritz?” “No, let’s go to the Piccadilly instead. It’s closer. We won’t need another taxi. Hurry up.” “Are you joking? Or are you actually losing your mind?” Tommy asked. “The latter. I’ve inherited some money, and it’s been overwhelming! An esteemed doctor suggests unlimited Hors d’œuvre, Lobster à l’américane, Chicken Newberg, and Pêche Melba for this type of mental distress! Let’s go indulge!” “Tuppence, what’s gotten into you?” “Oh, you skeptic!” Tuppence rummaged through her bag.",1
"""They shut it down. Just yesterday. They’re wrapping up the company, they claim. Never even knew it existed. But the office is up for rent.” “Th thank you,” stammered Tuppence. “Do you happen to have Mr. Whittington’s address?” “Sorry, no idea. They vanished in a hurry.” “Thanks a lot,” said Tommy. “Let’s go, Tuppence.” They returned to the street, exchanging a perplexed look. “Well, that’s a setback,” Tommy finally said. “And I had no clue,” lamented Tuppence. “Don’t worry, old chap, nothing we can do about it.” “You sure about that!” Tuppence’s chin jutted out defiantly.",1
"We shut the door behind us as Harry positioned himself next to the window with a view of the landing-stage. A boat was approaching, drawing closer. ""Who goes there?"" Harry's voice echoed loudly. Our suspicions about our uninvited guests were quickly confirmed. Bullets rained down around us, but miraculously we remained unscathed. Harry gripped the rifle tightly, firing with deadly accuracy. Two cries and a splash followed. ""That should give them pause,"" he muttered, grabbing a second rifle. ""Stay clear, Anne, and reload swiftly.""",1
"""Wells raised an eyebrow and said coolly, “Do you truly believe it’s just a coincidence, Cavendish?”   “What are you insinuating?”   “You mentioned that your mother had a heated argument with someone yesterday afternoon,” Wells continued.   “What are you insinuating?” John's voice quivered, his face draining of color.   “Following that argument, your mother hastily drafted a new will. The details of that will remain a mystery. She divulged nothing about its contents. Presumably, she intended to discuss it with me this morning, but circumstances prevented her.""",1
"I am completely agitated. The dreadful breakfast I had was accompanied by dreadful company. Slow Dutch waitresses served me subpar fish after making me wait. The ordeal of waking up at 5 a.m. to see a doctor upon arrival at the port is exhausting. But now, a serious issue has arisen. I presented Milray’s sealed letter to the Prime Minister, only to find a blank sheet inside. Pagett, a constant source of annoyance, seems pleased by my predicament. Despite my reluctance, I had to entertain his theory about Rayburn. The situation is escalating, and I am eager to leave for Rhodesia. I have made it clear to Pagett that he will not be joining me on this journey. My reputation as an English Member of Parliament is at stake.",1
"""In the presence of Brown?"" ""Yes, right here."" ""You don't get it? I am Mr. Brown,"" he stated confidently. Their expressions turned to shock and disbelief as they gazed at him. The features of his face seemed to have transformed entirely. It was as if a completely different person had materialized before them. He grinned maliciously. ""Neither of you will survive this encounter! You claimed victory earlier, but it is I who have truly triumphed. The confidential treaty is now in my possession."" His grin widened as he locked eyes with Tuppence. ""Would you like to hear my prediction? Eventually, law enforcement will storm in, only to discover three casualties at the hands of Mr. Brown.""",1
"""Consider the potential losses. I respect the man personally."" However, I was unable to view it from Poirot's philosophical perspective. ""And this is the individual Mrs. Cavendish has been traveling with extensively!"" I exclaimed with a sense of outrage. ""Indeed. I believe he has found her to be quite helpful,"" Poirot commented. ""As long as rumors linked their names, the doctor's other indiscretions went unnoticed."" ""So you believe he never truly loved her?"" I inquired eagerly, perhaps too eagerly given the situation.",1
"""I believe that was done quite some time ago,” I interjected. “No, as it is still noticeably moist and carries the aroma of coffee. There are four, a small piece of dark green material, just a couple of threads, but identifiable.” “Ah!” I exclaimed. “That is what you enclosed in the envelope.” “Correct. It could be a fragment from one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s own gowns, and possibly insignificant. Time will tell. Five, this!” With a theatrical motion, he indicated a substantial stain of melted candle wax on the floor next to the desk.",1
"I asked her, ""Don't you think this is sufficient? It's going to be quite horrifying and distasteful."" There was a strange expression on her face that I struggled to understand. Suddenly, she burst into laughter. ""I have a taste for the macabre,"" she declared. ""Let's go."" We made our way to the shed in complete silence. As I opened the door, we stepped inside. Approaching the body, I delicately uncovered it just as M. Bex had shown me the day before. A soft gasp escaped from the girl's lips, causing me to glance in her direction.",1
"""It was not part of the plan to draw attention to her presence in the area, but Albert was visibly excited. ""Miss, she's leaving!"" ""Who?"" Tuppence asked urgently. ""The criminal. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She's getting ready to leave, and she just asked me to get her a taxi."" ""What?"" Tuppence grabbed his arm. ""It's true, miss. I thought maybe you weren't aware of it."" ""Albert,"" Tuppence exclaimed, ""you're a hero. If it weren't for you, we would have missed her."" Albert blushed with pride at the compliment.""",1
"“Believe it or not, I had a dream where we stumbled upon Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and you accused her of killing Mr. Renauld,” I said. “That wasn’t a dream. It actually happened,” Poirot confirmed.“But Bella Duveen confessed to the murder, didn’t she?” “No, my dear Hastings, she did not. She took the blame to protect her lover from the death penalty.”“What?” “Think back to Jack Renauld’s account. They both arrived at the crime scene simultaneously, each mistaking the other for the killer. The girl, horrified, fled with a scream.”",1
"""Anne, it appears you've encountered your match. But remember, the path of righteousness doesn't always lead to victory."" Suddenly, the sound of splintering wood filled the air as footsteps thundered up the staircase. Harry swiftly unlocked the door. Colonel Race burst into the room, a look of relief washing over his features. ""You're safe, Anne. I was worried,"" he reassured her before turning his gaze to Sir Eustace. ""I've been on your trail for a while, Pedler, and now I've finally caught up with you."" Sir Eustace chuckled lightly, ""It seems everyone has lost their minds. These youngsters have been waving guns at me and hurling the most absurd accusations.""",1
"The news of his impending death had reached him. I won't delve into what happened next, as you are already aware. I had hoped to retrieve the documents from their secret location before it was too late, but I was apprehended. In a desperate attempt, I cried out that he was making a run for it, declaring my desire to return to Marguerite. The name Marguerite echoed three times in the room, a deliberate ploy on my part. I was counting on Mr. Beresford to connect it with the painting, a clue that had caught his attention on the very first day. It was this hesitation that made me question whether he could be trusted."" After a brief pause, she continued.",1
"""The man is incredibly lazy, hardly lifting a finger. Yet his skills rival my own, a remarkable feat."" ""Does he bear a resemblance to you?"" ""Somewhat, but lacking in charm. And he sports no facial hair."" ""Is he your senior, or junior?"" ""We share the same birthday."" ""Twins,"" I exclaimed. ""Precisely, Hastings. Your deductions are consistently on point. Now, back home we go. Time to focus on the Duchess's stolen necklace."" However, the Duchess's necklace would have to wait a little longer.",1
"Poirot sat calmly reading his mail. Among the usual requests, a peculiar letter caught his attention. It was a plea for help from a man in France, fearing for his life. The urgency of the situation was evident in the hastily scrawled postscript, begging Poirot to come quickly. Intrigued by the mystery, Poirot wasted no time in making plans to travel to France to meet this desperate man in need of his detective skills. The clock was ticking, and there was no time to waste.",1
"Upon questioning the prisoner about the will's destruction, it became apparent that his legal background informed him of its automatic revocation upon his stepmother's remarriage. He intended to present evidence regarding the will's destruction, hinting at a new perspective on the case. Additionally, he planned to highlight that evidence incriminating Lawrence Cavendish was just as compelling, if not more so, than that against his brother. It was now time to bring the prisoner to the stand.",1
"""To realize that Julius was in the same house as her for a brief period."" ""I was a complete fool,"" Julius muttered sadly. Tuppence tried to comfort him, ""You couldn't have known."" She then turned to Sir James for confirmation. ""I recommend not dwelling on it,"" he said kindly. ""No point in crying over spilled milk."" ""The important thing is to figure out our next move,"" Tuppence added pragmatically. Sir James just shrugged. ""You could try advertising for the nurse who was with the girl. It's the only option I can think of, but I don't have high hopes. Otherwise, there's nothing else we can do."" ""Nothing at all?"" Tuppence asked, feeling disheartened.",1
"Lord Estair confirmed that the Prime Minister was under police protection, with his chauffeur being an Irishman from County Clare named O’Murphy. The Prime Minister's car deviated from the main road and was ambushed by masked men, but managed to escape with only a slight wound. Despite the incident, the Prime Minister continued on to Charing Cross and then departed for France. However, the police later found the Prime Minister's car parked outside a suspicious restaurant in Soho, known to be frequented by German agents.",1
"""The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve."" The chauffeur thanked him and started the car once more. My gaze was captivated by the woman who remained standing, her hand resting on the gate, observing us. A true epitome of beauty, she was impossible to overlook. Towering in stature, possessing the allure of a youthful deity, her shimmering golden locks glistening in the sunlight, I silently acknowledged her as one of the most exquisite women I had ever beheld. As we ascended the rugged path, I glanced back in her direction. ""Goodness, Poirot,"" I remarked, ""did you catch sight of that stunning young woman?""",1
"I grow weary of having only Miss Pettigrew for company. “You’re in Jo’burg?” I inquired casually. “When did you get here?” “Just last night.” “Where are you lodging?” “With some friends.” He appeared unusually reserved, almost uncomfortable with my inquiries. “Let’s hope they have chickens,” I quipped. “Fresh eggs and the occasional rooster for dinner would be quite pleasant from what I’ve been told.” “Oh, and did you hear?” I mentioned later at the hotel. “Miss Beddingfeld is alive and well.” He nodded. “She certainly gave us all a scare,” I added nonchalantly.",1
"The lady occupying the cabin on the Kilmorden was Mrs. Blair, who interviewed the purser upon boarding. The steward mistook her for the real lady in question, Carton, who arranged a transaction involving diamonds. As the ship approached Cape Town, Miss Beddingfeld grew suspicious of Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace, and his secretary, Mr. Pagett. A conversation about Florence revealed Mr. Pagett's uneasiness, prompting Miss Beddingfeld to confront him about a possible guilty secret. Despite his initial reluctance, Mr. Pagett eventually opened up about his experiences in Italy, including the pictures and olive trees.",1
"""He arrived, had his interview, then departed. What unfolded next?"" Poirot suddenly grabbed my arm, pulling me towards the villa. ""Now, my friend, picture this - it's the day after the disappearance, and we're tracing footprints. You enjoy footprints, don't you? Look, here they lead, a man's, Mr. Halliday's.... He veers to the right like us, walking briskly oh! other steps following closely behind rapid small footsteps, a woman's. Observe, she catches up to him a slender young woman, wearing a widow's veil. 'Excuse me, sir, Madame Olivier requests your presence to be recalled.",1
"“Why are you in such a rush?” “Please let us through,” Tuppence demanded. “I need to speak with your friend here.” He reached out a shaky hand and grabbed Jane’s shoulder. Tuppence could hear approaching footsteps. Without hesitation, she ducked her head and charged at the man, just like she used to do when she was a child. The surprise attack worked like a charm. The man fell to the ground. Tuppence and Jane ran off towards the house they were heading to.",1
"""Listen, here's how it went down. The valet lurked in the empty room adjacent, ready. The French maid exits the room. Swiftly, the chambermaid yanks open the drawer, grabs the jewel-case, and, unlocking the bolt, slides it through the door.

Célestine exits the room once more, and shh! in a flash the case is returned and restored in the drawer. Madame shows up, the theft is unearthed.",1
"“Shall we check in at our usual spot, the Hôtel des Bains?” Without hesitation, we headed over. The staff informed us that they had two available rooms with a view of the sea. Poirot then inquired about the arrival of an English lady named Miss Robinson. Turns out, she was in the small sitting room. As we walked down the corridor, I couldn't help but ask Poirot about Miss Robinson. His response? ""I have found you a wife, Hastings."" Shocked, I protested, but Poirot dismissed my concerns and ushered me into the room. And there she was, Cinderella herself, waiting to greet us.",1
"I buried my nose in a bunch of violets and felt better. The attractive Mrs. Blair, a well-known society lady, caught my attention. She snubbed those who tried to scrape acquaintance, focusing her attention on a silent man. The next morning, Mrs. Blair led me to change cabins, but a dispute arose with Rev. Chichester and Mr. Pagett over Cabin 17. A terrible smell in my cabin turned out to be asafœtida, making me suspicious of the number 17. I decided to stay in the cabin, convinced that something would happen at one o'clock. The suspenseful night seemed endless as I waited for the unknown event.",1
"I waited for what felt like an eternity before I could finally feel the warmth returning to my hands. Rubbing my wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag that silenced me. Taking a few deep breaths, I managed to loosen the last knot, though it took some time before I could stand. Finally on my feet, I swung my arms to restore circulation, longing for a meal. After waiting to ensure my strength had returned, I silently made my way to the door. To my relief, it was only latched, not locked. I carefully unlatched it and peered out, making sure not to make a sound.",1
"Every person in the room stood up. The German motioned for them to step back. He loomed over Tommy, his face flushed with anticipation. ""You've found them, haven't you?"" With a composed demeanor, Tommy shook his head. ""Do you know their location?"" the German pressed. Once again, Tommy shook his head. ""I have no idea."" Frustrated and enraged, the German struggled to find his words. Tommy scanned the room. Despite the anger and confusion on everyone's faces, his confidence had made an impact. ""I may not know where the documents are, but I am confident that I can locate them. I have a plan."" ""Ridiculous!"" Tommy interrupted the outcries of disgust with a simple gesture.",1
"""I see myself as a specialized consultant."" Japp chuckled. ""I bet you five pounds that you can't point me in the direction of Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, within a week."" Poirot pondered. ""Very well, my friend, I agree. The thrill of the chase is a passion for you English. Now, the details."" ""Last Saturday, Mr. Davenheim boarded the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, his estate, The Cedars, being located there. He had lunch, inspected the grounds, and spoke with the gardeners as usual. Everyone noted that he was acting completely normal.""",1
"The pencil was handed back to Tommy with a grin, a new advertisement written on the slip of paper: ""IN SEARCH OF Jane Finn's whereabouts. Inquire for Y. A.""

Disappointment lingered from the previous day, but hope remained as they waited for responses to the new ad.",1

I swear, I will pursue him relentlessly.” “That's a relief,” Miss Howard exclaimed eagerly. “But I need you to have faith in me. Your cooperation could prove crucial. Let me explain. In this entire abode of sorrow, your tears are the only ones shed.” Miss Howard hesitated, her tone softening. “Yes, I cared for her deeply. Emily, despite her selfishness, was dear to me.""",1
"""As you did not provide me with an address, the letter was sent to me for forwarding,"" he clarified. Poirot examined the letter with interest. The handwriting, a woman's script, was long and slanted. Without opening it, he placed it in his pocket and stood up. ""Until tomorrow, M. le juge. Thank you for your kindness."" ""It is no trouble at all. I am here to assist you. These young detectives, followers of Giraud, they are all impolite and arrogant,"" he remarked.",1

"“Allow me to introduce Captain Lucien Bex, a dear friend from England,” Poirot gestured. The commissary and I exchanged nods before Bex redirected his attention to Poirot. “It has been quite some time, my old friend. Last I saw you was in Ostend back in 1909. I heard you had left the Force?” Poirot confirmed, “Indeed, I now operate a private business in London.” Bex inquired, “You mentioned having information that could be of help to us?” Poirot responded, “It is possible you are already aware. Did you know the victim had summoned me?” Bex was taken aback, “No, by whose request?” Poirot explained, “The deceased. He had foreseen an attempt on his life. Regrettably, he reached out to me too late.” The commissary interjected, “Sacri tonnerre!”",1

Should we eat here, or head to the restaurant?” Tuppence chose the latter option, and Julius respected her choice. They were enjoying Sole Colbert after finishing their oysters when a servant delivered a card to Hersheimmer.",1
"""Hautet pondered the scene before him. 'Another crime!' he exclaimed. 'The depths of this case have yet to be plumbed. A veil of mystery shrouds it all. But who is the unfortunate victim this time?' 'That, M. le juge, is the question on everyone's mind. The victim remains unidentified,' Giraud replied. 'Where is the body?' inquired the doctor. Giraud stepped aside, revealing the body in the corner. 'Stabbed through the heart, as you can see, with the very dagger stolen yesterday morning. It appears the murder swiftly followed the theft, but I leave that determination to you. Feel free to examine the dagger - there are no fingerprints to be found.'""",1
"""I think they must exercise caution. The key is always removed before exiting the room."" ""Is the cupboard located near the window?"" ""No, it's on the opposite side of the room. Why do you ask?"" Poirot raised his shoulders. ""Just curious. That's all. Will you join me inside?"" We had arrived at the cottage. ""No. I believe I'll head back. I'll take the longer route through the woods."" The woods surrounding Styles were exceptionally picturesque. Following the stroll across the open park, it was delightful to leisurely wander through the serene glades. There was barely a whisper of wind, the birds' chirping was barely audible.",1
"""We've spent too much time on this."" ""You're mistaken, my friend. The time spent was necessary. My agents, including Joseph Aarons, have been working on this for months. They've identified men meeting the criteria - around thirty, average looks, talented in playing character roles, and recently retired from the stage."" ""Go on,"" I urged. ""The list was quite extensive. We've been narrowing it down for a while now.""",1
"They gazed out at the rugged peaks and dense pine forests below. Poirot pointed towards the horizon. ""Is it there?"" he whispered. ""Yes,"" Harvey confirmed. ""The Felsenlabyrynth, a maze of massive boulders with a winding path through them. The quarry is to the right, but we suspect the entrance is within the labyrinth."" Poirot nodded. ""Come, my friend,"" he said to me. ""Let's descend to the terrace and bask in the sun."" ""Do you believe that's prudent?"" I inquired. He simply shrugged.",1
"I despise being entangled in such matters. The day took a turn when Guy Pagett entered my bedroom this morning, holding a telegram with a solemn expression that rivaled a mourner at a funeral. Guy Pagett, my diligent secretary, is an exemplary individual in every aspect - diligent, meticulous, and hard-working. Yet, he manages to irritate me like no other. I have pondered for quite some time on how to remove him from my service. However, it is not feasible to terminate a secretary simply because he prioritizes work over leisure, enjoys rising early, and possesses no discernible vices. The one redeeming quality about him is his somber countenance.",1
"""And, if they were already aligned, there would be no reason to align them again, unless, in the interim, someone else had handled them.” “My goodness,” I whispered, “so that clarifies your unusual actions. You hurried down to Styles, and discovered it undisturbed?” “Indeed, and it became a race against time.” “But I still can’t comprehend why Inglethorp was foolish enough to leave it there when he easily could have disposed of it.” “Ah, but he never had the chance. I made sure of that.” “You?” “Yes. Recall scolding me for sharing details with the household?” ""Yes.""",1
"After contemplating, I made the decision to share the information with John, letting him choose whether to make it public. His reaction was a loud whistle of surprise. ""You were right all along. I was in disbelief."" ""Indeed, it's quite shocking at first. But once you accept it, everything falls into place. Now, what's our next move? Tomorrow, everyone will know."" John thought for a moment. ""Don't worry,"" he finally spoke, ""let's keep quiet for now. No need to rush. It'll come out soon anyway.""",1
"""And rightly so! Your crime was a horrifying one, condemned by both gods and men!” M. Hautet declared, relishing the opportunity to deliver his speech with gravitas. “You have taken a life, and now you must face the consequences. I do not address you as a mere mortal, but as the embodiment of eternal Justice,” M. Hautet's speech was abruptly cut short. The door swung open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” the attendant stuttered, “there is a woman here who claims, who claims ” “Who claims what?” the magistrate demanded, his patience wearing thin.",1
"""I kept my silence, but inside I was grinning from ear to ear. Little did he know the truth."" Poirot gave a subtle nod. I observed a slight tremor in his hand as he reached for his drink. ""Handwriting can be a powerful tool in determining one's identity,"" he stated. ""Do you happen to have a letter penned by Mr. Darrell?"" Flossie Monro sadly shook her head. ""He was not one for writing. Never sent me a single letter."" ""A missed opportunity,"" Poirot commented. ""However,"" Miss Monro interjected abruptly.",1
"The passenger responsible for arranging the transaction went by the name of Carton, and his physical description matched that of the man who met his demise on the Underground. This revelation solved one mystery, revealing that the diamonds were the crucial element in the entire affair. The final days aboard the Kilmorden passed swiftly as we approached Cape Town, prompting me to carefully consider my next steps. There were numerous individuals I needed to monitor closely - from Mr. Chichester to Sir Eustace and his secretary, not forgetting Colonel Race. Determining how to proceed was no easy task. My focus naturally gravitated towards Chichester, leading me to reluctantly consider the fate of Sir Eustace and Mr..",1
"I always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with nervous eyes. His serious tone made me uneasy. “What do you mean, Poirot?” “We will find out soon enough, my friend. But I must go.” “You have plenty of time.” “Maybe maybe. But I prefer to take it easy at the station. I don't want to rush.” “I'll see you off,” I said, standing up. “Absolutely not. I won't allow it.” His firmness surprised me. He nodded decisively. “I'm serious, my friend. Goodbye! Can I give you a hug? Oh, right, I forgot it's not the English way.”",1
"A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. If only I could find a way to save them both.",1
"""We headed to the opposite side of the deck, where a sparkling white pinnacle rose in the distance, draped in a soft rose-coloured mist. Delighted, I couldn't help but exclaim. Mrs. Blair rushed to grab her camera. Despite Colonel Race's sarcastic remarks, she continued snapping away: “This is the last shot. Oh,” her tone shifted to disappointment, “I accidentally had it on ‘bulb’ the whole time.” “I always enjoy watching a child with a new toy,” the Colonel remarked. “You're so mean, but I have another roll.""",1
"""He was already a suspect, and when I brought the case to the public eye, I enlisted the help of ten amateur sleuths to keep a close watch on him. Knowing he was being surveilled, he had no choice but to abandon his plan of destroying the evidence and make a hasty exit, leaving it behind in the vase."" ""But what about Miss Howard? Couldn't she have been involved?"" ""No, Miss Howard was unaware of the document's existence. As part of their agreement, she never communicated with Alfred Inglethorp. They were meant to be sworn enemies, and until John Cavendish was safely convicted, they couldn't risk a chance encounter.""",1
"""Poirot hesitated before speaking, his voice barely a whisper: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is as follows: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, straight nose, no distinctive marks.” “Could it be Mrs. Robinson?” I interjected. “It's a possibility,” Poirot conceded. “Furthermore, there was a report of a dark-skinned man, possibly a foreigner, asking about the residents of No. 4 just this morning. Therefore, my friend, I suggest we abandon our sleep tonight and keep watch in the apartment below with your trusty revolver, of course!” “Count me in,” I responded eagerly.""",1
"There was a sudden rap at the door, and before I could even utter a word of acknowledgement, it swung open. I was taken aback by the unexpected visitor. My mind raced with images of Mr. Pagett wielding a gun, or my missionary acquaintance armed with a sandbag. However, what stood before me was a night stewardess, her face displaying curiosity and an air of respectability. ""Excuse me, miss, I thought I heard you call out,"" she remarked. ""No,"" I replied firmly. ""I did not."" ""I apologize for the intrusion."" ""It's quite alright,"" I reassured her. ""I couldn't sleep. A wash seemed like a good idea."" The words felt unfamiliar, as if self-care was a rare occurrence for me. ""I'm sorry, miss,"" the stewardess repeated, her tone apologetic.",1
"Tuppence was caught off guard by his aggressive tone, but she remained composed. Despite not fully understanding his accusations, her sharp wit urged her to maintain her facade. Whittington accused her of toying with him like a game of cat and mouse, pretending ignorance while knowing his true intentions. As he calmed down, the anger faded from his face and he scrutinized her, questioning if Rita had betrayed him. Tuppence silently denied his suspicions.",1
"""I've behaved foolishly in various ways, Monsieur Poirot. I am deeply in debt but I am determined to turn things around. I care for the children and I aim to resolve my issues so we can continue living in our home. Gregory Rolf has presented me with a lucrative opportunity that could help me get back on track. I am hesitant, as I despise the idea of participating in the pretentious activities at the Chase, but I may not have a choice,"" He paused, meeting Poirot's sharp gaze.",1
"I refrained from questioning Poirot about our destination in the presence of our captive, struggling to glean any insight into the situation. We arrived at a modest house set back from the road. A tipsy passerby staggered along the sidewalk, nearly bumping into Poirot, who uttered something sternly to him, the words escaping me. The three of us ascended the house's steps. Poirot pressed the doorbell and gestured for us to step back. Silence followed, prompting Poirot to ring the bell again before resorting to knocking loudly. A light flickered on above the door, which cautiously opened a crack.",1
"""The Countess Vera Rossakoff burst into the room, causing a commotion. Number Four greeted her as a trusted ally. The countess recognized a familiar face and exclaimed in disbelief. Poirot, comparing himself to Napoleon, stood firm in his allegiance to the powerful.""",1
"""Feel free to tell the story in your own words,"" I encouraged, as he continued: ""Arriving in Kimberley, we were filled with pride over our discovery. Carrying a valuable collection of diamonds, we sought the opinion of experts. It was at the Kimberley hotel where we encountered her."" My body tensed slightly, my hand gripping the doorpost unconsciously. ""Anita Grünberg, an actress. Youthful and strikingly beautiful. Though born in South Africa, her mother hailed from Hungary. There was an air of mystery surrounding her, adding to her allure for two young men fresh from the wilderness. It seems she had no trouble at all.""",1
"""We positioned ourselves on the grassy hill as Poirot advised, gazing towards the ocean. In the distance, the sounds of swimmers could be heard faintly. The sea glistened with the lightest shade of blue, evoking memories of our arrival in Merlinville and Poirot's teasing remark about my demeanor. It felt like ages had passed, though only three days had gone by. ""Focus, my dear,"" Poirot urged. ""Organize your thoughts. Approach this methodically and systematically. That is the key to triumph.""",1
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Johnson, a renowned archaeologist specializing in ancient civilizations.""",1
"""His plea was promptly granted, and I followed him upstairs, where he fell onto the bed, groaning loudly. Initially deceived, I soon realized that Poirot was merely acting, his intention being to be left alone upstairs near the patient's room. Therefore, I was not surprised when, as soon as we were alone, he jumped up. ""Quick, Hastings, the window. There is ivy outside. We can climb down before they begin to suspect."" ""Climb down?"" ""Yes, we must escape this house immediately. Did you see him at dinner?"" ""The doctor?"" ""No, young Templeton. His little trick with his bread.""",1
"""But do we really need to consider that? I cannot fathom Madame Renauld being in cahoots with Madame Daubreuil for a variety of reasons, some of which I have already discussed with you. The rest should be quite obvious. With that possibility out of the way, we are getting closer to the real truth, which is, as always, quite fascinating and intriguing.""“Poirot,” I exclaimed, “what else have you uncovered?”“My dear friend, you must rely on your own reasoning. You have all the necessary information at your disposal! Engage your mind. Think not as Giraud does, but as Hercule Poirot does.”“But can we be certain?”“Trust me, in many instances I have acted foolishly.",1
"I wondered if Miss Howard and Alfred Inglethorp could coexist peacefully under the same roof, knowing it would be a daunting task. John seemed to understand the challenge as well, his expression showing the difficulty of the situation. Seeking a break, he hastily left the room. Dorcas then entered with a fresh pot of tea. Poirot, who had been standing by the window, moved to sit across from Miss Howard. ""Mademoiselle,"" he began seriously, ""I have a question for you.",1
"""Having assumed I was alone on the boat deck, I was surprised to see another figure gazing out at the city. I instantly recognized him before he even turned around. The events of last night felt surreal in the calm morning light. What did he think of me? The words I had spoken made me cringe with embarrassment. Did I truly mean them? I quickly averted my gaze, focusing intently on Table Mountain. If Rayburn sought solitude up here, I would not intrude by making my presence known.""",1
"Let's go to Marsdon Manor and investigate further,” Poirot suggested, leading the way out of the consulting room. Mrs. Maltravers, a young and beautiful widow, followed us silently. Her eyes were red from crying, but her beauty was undeniable. She explained that her husband had been out shooting rooks on the day of his death. Poirot examined the rook rifle that was left in the hall. We needed to uncover the truth behind Mr. Maltravers' sudden demise.",1
"""The sorrowful eyes that made contact with mine were not filled with blame, indicating that she had recently shed tears, as evidenced by the redness of her eyelids. Despite this, her demeanor remained as gruff as ever. “I received the message and immediately embarked on my journey. Just finished my night shift. Rented a car for a quicker arrival.” “Have you had any breakfast this morning, Evie?” inquired John. “No, I haven't.” “I suspected as much. Follow me, they haven't cleared breakfast yet, and they can prepare some fresh tea for you.” John then addressed me. “Take care of her, Hastings, will you? Wells is expecting me.""",1
"Poirot was examining the crime scene thoroughly, his attention caught by a piece of discoloured lead-piping near the spade. Giraud, the Paris detective, seemed uninterested and continued his search. Poirot, however, was intrigued and found it very interesting. M. Bex, impressed by Poirot's quick understanding of the situation, praised him highly. The detective's efficiency was undeniable, even though I harbored a dislike for him. Poirot's focus on seemingly insignificant details puzzled me, but he seemed determined to uncover the truth.",1
"""Remember, not a word of this to Giraud,"" I cautioned Poirot. ""He seems to dismiss me as inconsequential. But we'll see about that. I did drop a hint to him, out of common decency. If he chooses to ignore it, that's on him."" Poirot nodded, trusting in my discretion. ""Very well then, let's engage our little grey cells. Do you have an estimate of when the tragedy occurred?"" I replied, ""Around two o'clock, I believe."" Poirot raised an eyebrow in surprise. ""Yes, Mrs. Renauld mentioned hearing the clock chime while the men were present in the room.""",1
"He insisted to her multiple times that it was four-thirty, not four o’clock when she heard the voices. However, Dorcas remained unfazed. At least an hour, if not more, had passed since she heard the voices and five o’clock, the time she brought tea to her mistress. The coroner's inquest took place on Friday at the Stylites Arms pub in the village. Poirot and I sat side by side, not called upon to testify. The initial procedures were completed. The jurors examined the corpse, and John Cavendish confirmed the identity.",1
"""Absolutely. Rubenstein was defeated by Savaronoff, who became the Russian champion several years back. Some claim Wilson is a close match to Capablanca."" Poirot pondered, ""A most intriguing turn of events. It seems you are especially interested in this case, am I correct?"" Japp chuckled awkwardly, ""You've got me there, Monsieur Poirot. I am perplexed. Wilson seemed perfectly healthy, no signs of heart issues. His sudden death is truly baffling."" ""Are you implying that Dr. Savaronoff may have had a hand in his demise?"" I interjected. ""I highly doubt that,"" Japp replied wryly.",1
"“Detective Poirot addressed the group with a list of seemingly random words: ‘Name,’ ‘Place,’ ‘Tuesday,’ ‘Dinner,’ ‘Journey,’ ‘Country,’ ‘Story,’ ‘Rook Rifle,’ ‘Shot,’ ‘Suicide,’ ‘Money.’ The room fell silent as Poirot’s gaze settled on each person in turn. ‘Thank you all for your cooperation,’ he said, dismissing them with a wave of his hand. Later, as the suspects filed out, Poirot turned to me with a knowing smile. ‘Do you see it now, Hastings?’ he asked. I was at a loss. ‘I’m afraid not,’ I admitted. ‘Allow me to enlighten you,’ Poirot replied, leaning in to share his insights.”",1
"“Good gracious, we’ve certainly surprised the poor man!” she exclaimed to an invisible crowd. “I beg your pardon for my outburst! Quite improper, I know, but my goodness, the circumstances warrant it! Can you believe I’ve misplaced my sole sibling?”“Is that so?” I responded courteously. “What a dreadful situation.”“He is disapproving!” the woman declared. “He wholeheartedly disapproves of me, and my sister, which is unjust, considering he has yet to meet her!” I started to speak, but she cut me off.“Enough said! No one cares for me! I shall retire to the orchard and devour earthworms! Oh woe is me! I am devastated!” With that, she disappeared behind a large, whimsical Italian magazine.",1
"Dressed elegantly in black attire adorned with exquisite pearls, the woman known to us as Countess Vera Rossakoff made a striking appearance. Little did we know at the time that she was secretly working as an agent for the notorious Big Four. Despite her allegiance to our enemies, Poirot inexplicably harbored a soft spot for the countess, admiring her flamboyant nature. In his eyes, she was a truly unique woman, unlike any other. Her betrayal seemed to have little impact on his unwavering fondness for her.",1
"With a cry of terror piercing the night, the girl vanished through the window, her wrists like steel. Poirot, impatient, brushed Françoise aside and hurried down the passage to the other maids. The door was locked from the inside, but a heavy fall was heard. Eventually, Cinderella opened the door to reveal Mrs. Renauld gasping for breath on the bed. She had been nearly strangled. Poirot examined a silk rope ladder - a means of escape. Meanwhile, a figure lay dead on the ground, revealed to be the beautiful Marthe Daubreuil. Confused memories flooded my mind as Poirot reprimanded Françoise for not disclosing Mrs. Renauld's change of room. The chaos culminated in Poirot demanding the doctor for Mrs. Renauld and then the police.",1
"""Tell me where she is. What have you done with her?"" ""She's safe, hidden away where no one can reach her. For now, she's unharmed. Notice how I said 'for now'."" A chill passed through me as I faced the grinning villain. ""What is it that you seek?"" I demanded. ""Money?"" ""Oh, dear Captain Hastings. Your savings are of no interest to us, I assure you. Not a bad guess on your part, though. Your partner wouldn't have thought of that."" ""I see,"" I replied wearily, ""you wanted to ensnare me. And you have. I walked into this willingly.""",1
"” She reluctantly agreed, promising to revisit the topic once we reached the Falls. The train departed at nine in the morning. Sir Eustace remained in a foul mood, while Miss Pettigrew appeared meek. Colonel Race exuded his usual air of confidence. I couldn't shake the feeling that our previous discussion was a figment of my imagination. That night, I slept fitfully on my uncomfortable cot, tormented by vague, threatening nightmares. The next morning, I awoke with a pounding headache and stepped out onto the observation deck. The air was crisp and fragrant, and as far as the eye could see, rolling wooded hills stretched out in every direction.”",1
"Tommy was in the midst of savoring a delightful bite of Sole à la Jeanette when Julius appeared in the doorway. With a wave of the menu, Tommy caught Julius's attention. Julius's eyes nearly bulged out of his head at the sight of Tommy. He crossed the room and vigorously shook Tommy's hand. ""Goodness gracious!"" he exclaimed. ""Is it truly you?"" ""Of course it's me. Why wouldn't it be?"" ""Why wouldn't it be? My goodness, you know you were presumed dead, don't you? We were about to hold a requiem for you."" ""Who believed I was dead?"" Tommy demanded.",1
"""Is it possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident?"" asked Lawrence. The Coroner and jury looked up, intrigued. ""I believe there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug, administered over time, has resulted in death,"" he continued. ""My mother, before her death, was taking a tonic containing strychnine."" The Coroner exclaimed, ""Ah! This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.""",1
"They were just regular, working-class individuals from the neighborhood, claiming they had no idea who Li Chang Yen was. A man of Chinese descent had hired them to work at the waterfront residence, but they were completely unaware of his personal matters. The following day, aside from a minor headache, I had fully recovered from the aftermath of Poirot's gas attack. Together, we ventured into Chinatown and explored the building where I had been rescued. The property consisted of a pair of rundown houses connected by an underground tunnel. Both the ground and upper levels of each house were empty and abandoned, with broken windows concealed by deteriorating shutters.",1
"""When you were assigned to this case, did you turn up your nose and claim it was distasteful, and you wanted no part in it?"" ""No, but"" ""If you were here on vacation, wouldn't you be investigating just like I am? Of course you would."" ""I'm a man. You're a woman."" ""Your view of a woman is someone who jumps on a chair and screams at the sight of a mouse. That's outdated. But you will give me a tour, won't you? You see, it could greatly benefit me."" ""How so?"" ""They've barred all the journalists. I could have a major exclusive with one of the newspapers. You have no idea how much they pay for insider information."" I hesitated.",1
"The murmur was hoarse. ""It's fine, sir."" After a brief pause: ""What if I get caught."" ""You will be provided with top legal representation,"" the German responded calmly. ""And you will be wearing gloves with the fingerprints of a well-known burglar. You have nothing to worry about."" ""I'm not scared, sir. It's all for the greater good. They say the streets will flow with blood."" He spoke with a sinister excitement. ""I even dream about it sometimes. Diamonds and pearls scattered on the ground for the taking!"" Tommy noticed a chair being moved.",1
"I presented all of our displays to them. Japp's lack of method disappoints me!"" ""Hello!"" I exclaimed, peering out the window. ""There's Dr. Bauerstein. I think you're onto something about that man, Poirot. I distrust him."" ""He is astute,"" Poirot remarked thoughtfully. ""Oh, astute as the devil! I must admit, I was thrilled to witness his predicament on Tuesday. It was quite a sight!"" And I recounted the doctor's misadventure. ""He appeared like a complete mess! Covered in mud from head to toe."" ""You saw him, then?"" ""Indeed, yes.""",1
"As universally agreed, they conversed in English, revealing the Count's true origins now that his facade had faded away. It was known that he had once thrived as a quick-change performer in London's music halls. ""You excelled tonight,"" he acknowledged. ""My compliments to you."" ""Nevertheless,"" the woman confessed, ""I am uneasy. My status is precarious. The doubts sown during the War persist. I am under constant surveillance."" ""Yet you were never formally accused of espionage?"" ""Our leader is too meticulous for that."" ""Here's to the 'Colonel,'"" the Count toasted, with a grin on his face.",1
"I wandered further, eventually collapsing under the shade of a towering oak tree. My outlook on humanity was gentle and benevolent. I found myself even pardoning Poirot for his unnecessary secrecy. Truly, I was content with the universe. A yawn escaped me. The crime crossed my mind, feeling distant and almost imaginary. Another yawn emerged. Perhaps, I considered, it was all a figment of my imagination. Surely, it was simply a nightmare. The reality of the situation became clear - it was Lawrence who killed Alfred Inglethorp using a croquet mallet.",1
"I have never witnessed a man in such distress. The situation is truly bizarre. Where could the young woman have disappeared to? She left the hotel at eleven-ten, fully clothed, and vanished without a trace. Suicide is out of the question; she was a vibrant soul with a deep love for life. With no trains departing until noon the next day, she couldn't have left town. So, where on earth is she? Race, her partner, is frantic. He has done everything in his power to find her. Law enforcement officers from all over the region have been called in to assist.",1
"""Thank you."" Mr. Mace received the phial from Counsel and recognized it as the one he had sold to ""Mr. Inglethorp."" He confessed that he only knew Mr. Inglethorp by sight and had never spoken to him. The witness was not challenged. Alfred Inglethorp took the stand, denying the purchase of the poison and any quarrel with his wife. Several witnesses confirmed his statements. The gardeners' testimony on witnessing the will was heard, followed by Dorcas. Faithful to her ""young gentlemen,"" Dorcas vehemently denied hearing John's voice and insisted it was Mr.",1
"I was relieved to receive a telegram informing me that Anne was safe in Kimberley with Suzanne Blair. Anne had always been a resilient woman, much like a terrier with a knack for turning up smiling. The news of her safety brought me comfort, but I couldn't help but wonder why she had chosen to leave the hotel in the middle of the night to get to Kimberley. Did she sprout wings and fly there? It seemed unlikely, but with Anne, anything was possible. Her mysterious ways always left me guessing, a common theme in my life. As a crime novelist, I was accustomed to uncovering secrets and solving mysteries, but with Anne, the answers never came easy. It was a puzzle I may never solve, adding to the intrigue of our complicated relationship.",1
"""It's undeniable that the letters arrived via post, yet there's a peculiar scent lingering on them, reminiscent of joss-sticks that immediately evoked the East in my mind. What could be the significance of it all?"" I pondered. My companion shook his head in bewilderment. ""That is precisely what we need to uncover. Do you still have the letters in your possession? Perhaps the postmarks hold a clue."" His response was disheartening. ""Regrettably, I disposed of them. You see, back then I perceived it as a mere jest. Is it conceivable that a Chinese syndicate is genuinely pursuing the diamonds? It sounds preposterous."" Despite our efforts, we found ourselves at an impasse, unable to progress any further in unraveling the enigma.",1
"""Isn't it curious how all the bedroom doors were locked from the inside?” “Hmm,” I pondered. “Let's approach this rationally.” “Agreed.” “Here's my take. The doors were clearly bolted, as we saw, but the candle wax and the broken window suggest someone did get in. Following me?” “Crystal clear. Keep going with your theory.""",1
"“I was just summarizing the key aspects of the case,” I explained to Poirot. “Ah, so you’re finally becoming systematic,” he remarked, nodding in approval. I hesitated before continuing, “Here are my notes: '1. The evidence strongly suggests that Lowen was the one who broke into the safe. 2. Lowen harbored a grudge against Davenheim. 3. Lowen lied about his whereabouts in his initial statement. 4. Billy Kellett's account directly connects Lowen to the crime.'” I awaited Poirot's response.",1
"Silently, the Kilmorden approached closer and closer, like a dream to Anne Beddingfeld. As she marveled at the world around her, she noticed a figure by her side. It was Rayburn, the man she had encountered the night before. His warning about the dangerous business she was involved in sent shivers down her spine. He advised her to be cautious and not to meddle in affairs that could put her in harm's way. Despite her confusion, Rayburn's words struck a chord with her. She couldn't help but wonder why he was going out of his way to protect her.",1

"On the 29th, the highly anticipated ""Labour Day"" arrived, sparking a frenzy of speculation and rumors. Newspapers buzzed with sensational reports of a potential Labour coup d’état, while the Government remained ominously silent, secretly bracing for whatever may come. Behind the scenes, whispers of discord among the Labour leaders circulated, revealing a lack of unity in their ranks. Some, however, foresaw the potential consequences of their actions, understanding the grave implications it could have on the country they deeply cared for.",1
"“Let us enter, sir.” “Do you have our associates unharmed?” “Yes, they are safe. However, they were not in possession of the items.” “I understand. So you have come to conduct a search. I am preparing to leave with Hastings, but before I go, I would like to share some insights on the history and behaviors of the household cat.” “Goodness gracious, have you lost your mind?” “The cat,” Poirot announced, “was revered by the ancient Egyptians. Even today, it is believed to be a sign of good fortune if a black cat crosses your path. Tonight, this cat has crossed your path, Japp. To discuss the inner workings of any creature or individual is, I realize, considered impolite in England.",1
"""Observing the striking resemblance in handwriting between the note, the register, and your own, I will leave that matter for the jury to ponder,” Mr. Philips announced before taking his seat. The session was adjourned until Monday due to the late hour.

Despite my efforts to remain calm, a wave of relief washed over me.",1
"Not forgetting the mysterious visitor from the previous night, I made a mental note to locate him on the ship before the day was out.

"Have you ever experienced a mudslide? There was one not too far from here a couple of years back. Another one is set to happen tonight. I've taken care of that quite thoroughly. By the way, your acquaintance seems to have a habit of being late."" A feeling of dread washed over me. Poirot! Any moment now, he would unwittingly walk into danger. I was helpless to alert him. All I could do was hope that he had entrusted the task to me and had stayed put in London. If he was on his way, he would have arrived by now. As each minute passed, my optimism grew. But then, my optimism was shattered.",1
"Carter gestured towards the new arrival. ""I called him here, although I doubt he'll reveal much. He's too guarded. Still, he could shed light on a few unclear details in Beresford's letter. Ah, there he is!"" The two men stood up to welcome the newcomer. A passing thought crossed the Premier's mind. ""Could he be my successor?""  ""We received a letter from Beresford,"" Mr. Carter stated bluntly. ""You've met with him, I assume?""  ""You assume incorrectly,"" the lawyer replied.  ""Oh,"" Mr. Carter was taken aback. Sir James chuckled and rubbed his chin.",1
"""The Inspector from Scotland Yard was waiting on the platform, eagerly anticipating our arrival. ""Ah, Monsieur Poirot, I knew you would want to be involved in this intriguing mystery,"" he exclaimed. I could tell that Japp was genuinely perplexed and was hoping Poirot could provide some insight. Japp had a waiting car ready for us, and we made our way to Croftlands. The house was a simple, white square building, adorned with vines, including the fragrant yellow jasmine. Japp gazed at the house thoughtfully. ""The poor soul must have been quite delusional to compose that,"" he mused.""",1
"Lady Willard was distraught after her husband's death, worried about the possibility of an ancient curse haunting her son. She sought the help of Monsieur Poirot, who surprisingly admitted to believing in superstition. Poirot assured her that he would protect her son from harm, both physical and occult. Lady Willard mentioned the members of the expedition, including her husband's nephew, who had recently committed suicide in New York. Poirot decided to investigate further and they set off for Egypt the next day, despite Poirot's dread of the sea. Now, beneath the scorching sun of the desert, Poirot's discomfort was evident as they approached the Pyramids.",1
"Why did the murder have to happen in my own home? Out of all the homes in the country, why choose my Mill House? What did I ever do to deserve this? Suzanne offered her sympathy once more as Sir Eustace continued in a tone filled with frustration. And to make matters worse, the man who committed the crime had the audacity to become my secretary. My secretary! I've had enough of them - they're either killers in disguise or troublemakers. Have you seen Pagett's bruised eye? It's time to put an end to this.",1
"“We should bring him home, to Villa Marguerite. My mother and I will take care of him. Poor Jack!” With great effort, we managed to transport the boy to the Villa, where he collapsed into a chair, looking disoriented. Poirot checked his temperature and pulse. “He's running a fever. The stress is catching up with him. Let's get him to bed, while Hastings and I call for a doctor.” A doctor arrived promptly. Following a thorough examination, he concluded that it was just a matter of nerve strain.",1
"""A female approaching her residence, presumably her own given her use of a key, immediately ascends the staircase without acknowledging two unfamiliar individuals in the hallway. This behavior is peculiar, bordering on unnatural. Mon dieu! What was that?"" He pulled me away just in time. A tree had fallen onto the pavement, narrowly avoiding us. Poirot gazed at it, looking pale and disturbed. ""That was a close call! However, it was rather careless, as I had little to no inkling of any danger lurking.""",1
"""And had kept a close eye on her, especially when she was cleaning Madame’s room! Let those bumbling policemen search her, but they won’t find Madame’s pearls. Célestine spoke rapidly in French, punctuating her words with animated gestures, and the chambermaid understood her message. She flushed with anger. “That woman is accusing me of stealing the pearls, but it’s not true!” she protested vehemently. “I never even laid eyes on them.” “Go ahead, search her!” the woman shrieked. “You’ll see that I’m right.” “You’re a liar!” the chambermaid retorted, moving towards her aggressively.""",1
"""The constant chatter! Deep down we are aware,” abruptly interrupted the Coroner, his face filled with dread. “Your time is up, Miss Howard,” he added. I could sense his relief when she stopped speaking. Then came the moment everyone was waiting for. The Coroner summoned Albert Mace, a young assistant at the chemist’s. It was the same nervous young man with the ashen complexion. He revealed that he was a qualified pharmacist who had recently started working at this shop, as the previous assistant had been called to serve in the army. After these initial details were shared, the Coroner got down to business.",1
"I peered through the crack in the shutters, my heart pounding and a sense of dread creeping over me. On the other side of the street, I spotted my friend immediately, despite his coat collar turned up and a yellow muffler obscuring part of his face. The unmistakable walk, the egg-shaped head - it was Poirot, arriving to help me without a hint of suspicion. Beside him trotted a classic London street urchin, dirty-faced and dressed in tattered clothes. If Poirot had any inkling of danger, my wife would face a fate worse than death.",1
"I enjoy my exclusive Club, a competitive game of Bridge, a gourmet meal, and a fine glass of wine. I prefer the charm of England during the summer months and the luxury of the Riviera in winter. I have no interest in being part of sensational events. Occasionally, by the fireplace, I don't mind reading about them in the news. However, I draw the line there. My main goal in life is to be completely at ease. I've invested time and money to achieve that, though success is not always guaranteed. Even if I don't seek out excitement, it seems to find me, and I often find myself entangled in unexpected situations.",1
"""Everything adds up,"" Poirot remarked after Japp departed, ""except for his death appearing natural."" He gazed at the lifeless body with a dissatisfied expression. A gust of wind caused the window curtains to flutter, prompting Poirot to look up abruptly. ""Did you open the windows when you placed him on the bed, Hastings?"" ""No, I didn't,"" I responded. ""I think they were closed."" Poirot suddenly raised his head. ""Closed before, but now they're open. What could that signify?"" ""Perhaps someone entered through them,"" I suggested. ""It's possible,"" Poirot conceded, though he sounded distracted and uncertain.",1
"“Françoise’s account appears to be accurate,” he confided in me. “I've been in touch with headquarters. It seems that in the past six weeks, ever since M. Renauld's arrival in Merlinville, Madame Daubreuil has deposited a significant amount of money into her bank account three times. The total sum adds up to two hundred thousand francs!” “My goodness,” I mused, “that's around four thousand pounds, isn't it?” “Exactly. It's clear that he was completely smitten.”",1
"""Tommy's mind raced with new possibilities after Boris's revelation. Whittington was on a solo journey, leaving Tommy to decide who to tail. Glancing at the clock and train schedule, Tommy saw that the Bournemouth train departed at 3:30, with only twenty minutes to spare. Whittington and Boris lingered by the bookstall, oblivious to Tommy's next move. With a final glance in their direction, Tommy darted into a nearby telephone box, ready to make his next move.""",1
"I inspected the paper that he had lost, a plain half-sheet with some figures and words scribbled in pencil. The scent of moth balls lingered as I carefully folded it and placed it in my bag. Walking home slowly, I pondered over the strange feeling I had during the Tube incident. At the inquest, it was confirmed that the deceased was L. B. Carton, who had checked in at the Russell Hotel. The jury speculated wildly about what could have alarmed him, even suggesting a fear of cats. As the coroner questioned me, I maintained that it was an accident caused by a moment of panic. The case took a surprising turn when a woman was found murdered in a lonely house in Marlow, bringing new mysteries to light.",1
"""I woke up in the hospital with only faint memories before that"" Sir James listened intently. ""Tell me what you recall."" She hesitated before speaking. ""I found myself at Holyhead. I can't explain why."" ""That's not important. Keep going."" ""I managed to slip away unnoticed in the chaos on the dock. I hailed a car and instructed the driver to take me out of town. As we hit the open road, I scanned for any pursuit. Seeing none, I spotted a trail off to the side. I asked the driver to stop."" After a moment, she continued.",1
"“What’s this?” “The sleeve of my coat that I removed, can you brush it for me? Look, some white powder has stuck to it. Did you see me run my finger along the dressing-table drawer?” “No, I didn’t.” “You must pay attention to my movements, my friend. That’s how I ended up with the powder on my finger, and, in my excitement, I rubbed it on my sleeve in a moment of carelessness, going against all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I inquired, showing little concern for Poirot’s principles.",1
"""Understand? You must save these documents! Your odds are better than mine. Will you accept them?"" The woman extended her hand. ""Hold on, I need to caution you. There might be a threat if someone is following me. I don't believe so, but one can never be sure. If that's the case, there will be risks. Are you brave enough to proceed?"" The woman grinned. ""I'll see it through. And I'm honored to be selected! What should I do next?"" ""Keep an eye on the news! I will place an ad in the Times personal section, starting with 'Shipmate.' If after three days there is no response, then you'll know I'm in trouble.""",1
"""Why must they be cleaned? Do I parade myself on the front like a young man? On Sundays I wear the Sunday boots, of course, but other times!"" he shrugged. I shook my head, disheartened. ""Well, well,"" the magistrate said. ""We are not making much progress. We are surely waiting on the return cable from Santiago. Has anyone seen Giraud? Honestly, that one lacks manners! I am tempted to summon him and-"" ""You won't have to look far, M. le juge."" The calm voice surprised us. Giraud stood outside, peering in through the open window.",1
"Ah, it was executed with remarkable precision! After setting the clock to 8.47, he violently smashes it and halts time. The one oversight: he neglects to close the curtains. In a real scenario, the curtains would have been drawn once daylight waned. After swiftly informing the lift operator about the guests, he rushes to a phone booth. At almost precisely 8.47, he calls the doctor with his employer's final plea. His plan is so flawless that there is never any investigation into whether a call was made from Flat II at that exact moment. ""Unless Hercule Poirot decides to meddle,"" I remarked sarcastically.",1
"“Allow me to maintain my little secret. Please give Lady Yardly my deepest respects and inform her of my delight in returning her jewel. Lovely weather today, isn't it? Good day, my lord."" With a smile, the peculiar man escorted the confused nobleman to the door. Returning, he rubbed his hands gently. ""Poirot,"" I inquired. ""Am I losing my mind?"" ""No, my friend, just lost in thought as usual."" ""How did you obtain the diamond?"" ""From Mr. Rolf."" ""Rolf?"" ""Yes! The threatening letters, the Chinaman, the Society Gossip article - all creations of Mr. Rolf's clever mind! The two identical diamonds? Pure fiction.""",1
"Miss Tuppence quickly informed me of that. She is straightforward and we should get along just fine.” Tommy stared at him with interest for a moment, as if he were going to say something, but then decided against it. Tuppence and Julius! Why not? Hadn't she expressed her desire for a wealthy husband? Hadn't she openly stated that she would marry for money if given the opportunity? Meeting the young American millionaire presented that opportunity and she would not hesitate to take advantage of it. She was after wealth.",1
"""Sir Laurence Eardsley wielded great power. He managed to have the charges dropped, but it resulted in the ruin of two young men who now bore the shame of being labeled as thieves. It was a heavy blow for the elderly man, his heart shattered by the outcome. A bitter confrontation ensued between father and son, where harsh words were exchanged. Despite Sir Laurence's efforts to protect the family reputation, his son was forever estranged. The young man, full of pride and stubbornness, chose to remain silent, refusing to defend himself against his father's accusations.""",1
"""I've labeled them as 1, 2, 3. Can you provide a description of each?"" I carefully examined the evidence. ""All highly enlarged, it seems. No. 1 appears to be a man's fingerprints; thumb and index finger. No. 2 belong to a woman; much smaller and completely different. No. 3,"" I hesitated for a moment, ""there appears to be a jumble of various prints, but here, clearly visible, are No. 1's."" ""Are they overlapping with the others?"" ""Yes."" ""Are you absolutely certain of their identity?"" ""Without a doubt; they match perfectly."" Poirot acknowledged this with a nod, then delicately retrieved the photographs from me and secured them once more.",1
"Arriving early would be too eager, so Tuppence opted to stroll to the end of the street and back before entering the building. At eleven o'clock sharp, she ventured into the depths of the establishment. The Esthonia Glassware Co. occupied the highest level, accessible by a lift that Tuppence bypassed in favor of the stairs. A bit winded, she stopped outside the frosted glass door marked ""Esthonia Glassware Co."" Tuppence rapped on the door and, upon hearing a voice from inside, turned the knob and entered a small, somewhat grimy reception area. A middle-aged clerk descended from his tall stool at a desk by the window and approached her with a questioning expression.",1
"""Dear Hastings, I am in need of a new residence and have set my sights on Montagu Mansions. There is an air of intrigue surrounding that place, mark my words."" Luckily, luck was on our side. Apartment No. 8, located on the fourth floor, was available for rent at the price of ten guineas per week. Without hesitation, Poirot secured it for a month. As we stepped back onto the bustling street, he dismissed my objections with a wave of his hand: ""I am doing well financially, my friend. Why not treat myself to a little luxury? And speaking of which, Hastings, do you happen to possess a revolver?"" ""I believe I do, somewhere,"" I replied, feeling a shiver of excitement. ""Do you anticipate"" ""Needing it? It is a distinct possibility.""",1
"""My physician, he assures me that one does not perish from it and it is a singular occurrence; you follow, that never never shall I come back."" He forced me into a seat. ""Come, I will explain how it all transpired. Do you know who is the wealthiest individual in the world? Wealthier even than Rockefeller? Abe Ryland."" ""The American Soap King?"" ""Exactly. One of his assistants approached me. There is some very significant, as you might say, legerdemain occurring in relation to a large corporation in Rio. He wanted me to look into matters on site. I declined.""",1
"""Feel free to do as you please with me, just release her. She's innocent and of no value to you. You've only used her to track me down, which you've accomplished. The game is over."" The charming man of Eastern descent gently touched his flawless face, observing me with his slanted eyes. ""You're jumping ahead,"" he purred. ""It's not quite over yet. Our main goal is not to capture you, as you assume. But rather, by capturing you, we aim to reach your associate, M. Hercule Poirot."" ""I doubt you'll succeed,"" I chuckled. ""Here's my proposal,"" he continued, his words flowing uninterrupted, as if my response was unheard.",1
"... She couldn't bear to see him suffer! Would she be the one to seal his fate? Guilty of many things, but innocent of the crime they accused her of. Yet, her charm and charisma prevailed. In a whirlwind of emotions, Madame Beroldy was found not guilty. Despite the police's best efforts, Georges Conneau remained elusive. And as for Madame Beroldy, she vanished without a trace, taking the child with her to start anew. The Beroldy case, with all its intricacies, is now documented. Not every detail is crystal clear in my mind as I recollect the events.",1
"""In that scenario, could it be that the items in question were planted by an unknown individual, catching the prisoner off guard?"" ""I wouldn't count on it."" ""But it's within the realm of possibility?"" ""Indeed."" ""That's it."" Subsequent testimony emerged. Details of the financial troubles the prisoner faced by the end of July. Accounts of his involvement with Mrs. Raikes' impoverished daughter Mary, a revelation surely stinging for a woman of her stature. Evelyn Howard's accuracy in presenting the facts was undeniable, even though her personal vendetta against Alfred Inglethorp led her to prematurely accuse him.",1
"“Then, naturally, we must ascertain our current situation. What was the time of Mr. Schneider’s passing?” “Three days prior.” “You are certain it was tetanus?” “Absolutely certain.” “There is no possibility of it being strychnine poisoning, correct?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I understand your concern. But it was undoubtedly tetanus.” “Were anti-serums administered?” “Indeed they were,” the doctor replied curtly. “We exhausted all possible measures.” “Did you have the anti-serum on hand?” “No. We obtained it from Cairo.",1
"A large settee covered in chintz sat against the wall, while the window seats were also draped in the same faded chintz. Poirot, lighting a cigarette, discussed their plan. He believed the clue they sought was in the room, hidden among the documents in the desk. Despite not expecting to find the will, Poirot suspected a seemingly innocent paper held the key. After calling for Mrs. Baker, they learned about the will-signing and the mysterious workmen from Plymouth. Poirot deduced that a second will had been made, with a hiding spot created by the workmen. In Plymouth, they confirmed the details and discovered the hidden cavity behind a brick in the fireplace. With excitement, Poirot reached into the cavity.",1
"""No one suspects her. Her movements around the house go unnoticed. She plants the poison and glasses in John's quarters. The fake beard is stashed away in the attic. She ensures that they will be found eventually."" ""I can't understand why they pinned the blame on John,"" I commented. ""It would have been simpler to frame Lawrence."" ""True, but that was just luck. The case against him was purely circumstantial. It must have been frustrating for the conspirators."" ""His behavior didn't help,"" I mused. ""Agreed.",1
"Somehow or other you had been abducted by the infamous Big Four. But for what purpose? It was clear they didn't take you for your charm, nor out of fear or desire to remove you. No, their intentions were straightforward. You were to serve as bait to lure the great detective Hercule Poirot into their trap. I had anticipated something of this nature for a while. Making my own discreet arrangements, it wasn't long before the messenger appeared - a seemingly innocent child of the streets. Falling for the ruse, I followed him without hesitation, while luckily they allowed you to be seen on the doorstep.",1
"""We never considered that possibility."" ""Like I mentioned,"" M. Hautet continued, ""initially the case appeared straightforward, but the presence of the masked intruders and the mysterious letter from M. Renauld have added layers of complexity. It seems we are now dealing with a completely separate set of circumstances, seemingly unrelated. In regards to the letter addressed to you, is it plausible that it had any connection to this 'Bella' and her menacing intentions?"" Poirot dismissed the idea with a shake of his head. ""Highly unlikely. A man of M. Renauld's caliber, someone who has experienced life's dangers in far-flung corners of the world, would not seek protection from a woman."" The examining magistrate vigorously nodded in agreement.",1
"""But before we proceed, we require some information. Please ring the bell,"" I requested. Upon doing so, Poirot paced back and forth while we waited for a response, his keen eyes taking in the orderly surroundings. ""Mr. Marsh is a man of great method. Note the meticulous organization of the papers and the ivory labels on each drawer and cabinet key. Even the china cabinet is impeccably arranged. It is truly a sight to behold, nothing out of place,"" he remarked. Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a dirty envelope attached to the key of the desk, bringing his movements to a sudden halt.",1
"I decided to rename the car ""Colonel Race and his Entourage"" instead of ""Sir Eustace Pedler and Party."" Mrs. Blair, on the other hand, became fixated on taking absurd photos during our journey. With each treacherous turn and ascent, she insisted on capturing shots of the engine. ""Can you see the thrill?"" she exclaimed with glee. ""It's truly remarkable to photograph the front of the train from the rear, especially with the backdrop of the looming mountains."" I tried to explain that the perspective was indiscernible, but she simply smiled and replied, ""I will caption it: 'Taken from the train.'""",1
"""If they catch me now,"" she whispered, her eyes widening in fear. Tuppence quickly interjected, ""Don't worry, just relax. Tommy wouldn't have given the green light if it wasn't safe."" Jane, feeling uneasy, mentioned, ""Your cousin was against this plan."" Tuppence, feeling awkward, responded, ""Yes, I know. But I have a feeling about this."" Jane, noticing the odd tone in Tuppence's voice, questioned, ""What's on your mind?"" Tuppence hesitated before admitting, ""I have a theory, but I can't share it yet. Tommy might have the same inkling.""",1
"Tommy lamented the delay in supper, fearing he would have to wait until breakfast. By ten o’clock, his hope had diminished, leading him to seek solace in sleep. Just as he succumbed to slumber, the sound of a key in the lock startled him awake. Not the type to wake with sharp clarity, Tommy blinked, disoriented. Recalling his surroundings, he checked his watch: it read eight o’clock. ""Time for either morning tea or breakfast,"" he thought anxiously. As the door opened, he could only hope for the latter.",1
"“Tommy muttered under his breath as he tossed it away. The door swung open, and Julius barged in, brandishing a newspaper. “What’s the deal with this? They’re spreading some nonsense about Tuppence.” “It’s the truth,” Tommy replied calmly. “So, they did away with her?” Tommy confirmed. “I reckon once they secured the treaty, she became a liability, and they couldn’t risk letting her loose.” “Well, I’ll be damned,” Julius exclaimed. “Sweet little Tuppence. She was one brave kid.” But then, something inside Tommy seemed to snap. He stood up abruptly.",1
"“I always knew you Revolutionists valued life less, but it seems that changes when it’s your own life on the line. I offered you a single opportunity to save yourself, and yet you refused!” “They’ll murder me!” “Hmm,” Julius remarked with a smile, “the decision is yours. However, I must warn you. Little Timmy there is a sure shot, and if I were you, I’d gamble on Mr. Smith!” “If you kill me, you’ll face the gallows,” the Russian muttered hesitantly. “No, my friend, you misunderstand. Don't forget about the money.""",1
"After changing their approach, Tuppence's short stay near the Moat House suggested she was abducted and taken away in a car. Despite their efforts, no one had seen a car parked near the Moat House that day. Julius, determined, called for his own car from town and they tirelessly searched the area every day.",1
"""Look who's here, the Inspector. Good. I've seen everything I needed to see."" He tapped his fingers on the table absentmindedly, as if lost in thought, then suddenly asked, ""What day is it, my friend?"" ""Monday,"" I replied, surprised. ""Really?"" ""Ah, Monday, huh? Not a good day. Making a mistake committing a murder on a Monday."" Walking back to the living room, he touched the glass on the wall and checked the thermometer. ""Sunny and seventy degrees Fahrenheit. A typical English summer day.""",1
"""He hesitated. ""So you're saying,"" she murmured quietly, ""the confirmation of my husband's body?"" The judge inclined his head. ""I am a resilient woman, sir. I can handle whatever is asked of me. I am prepared now."" ""Oh, tomorrow will suffice, I promise you."" ""I would rather face it now,"" she uttered softly, a look of anguish briefly crossing her features. ""If you wouldn't mind offering me your arm, Doctor?"" The physician stepped forward, a cloak draped over Mrs. Renauld's shoulders, and a solemn procession descended the stairs. Mr. Bex rushed ahead to unlock the shed's door.""",1
"Mrs. Renauld glanced at M. Hautet, awaiting his inquiry. ""You had a question for me, M. le juge."" ""If I may, madame. I gather your late husband hailed from French Canadian roots. Can you shed light on his early years or upbringing?"" She shook her head. ""My husband was quite reserved regarding his personal history, sir. He originated from the North West, but I suspect his childhood was fraught with difficulties, as he never broached the subject. Our focus was always on the here and now, looking towards the future."" ""Did he harbor any secrets from his past?"" Mrs. Renauld pondered, her expression unreadable.",1
"""Should we swing by to fetch Cynthia? No, she must have already left the hospital."" ""Cynthia! Is she your wife?"" ""No, Cynthia is a protege of my mother's, the daughter of her old school friend who married a shady lawyer. When he went bankrupt, the girl was left alone and broke. My mother stepped in, and Cynthia has been living with us for almost two years. She's employed at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster, seven miles away."" As he finished speaking, we arrived in front of the elegant old mansion. A woman in a sturdy tweed skirt, tending to a flower bed, stood up straight as we approached.",1
"""Poirot explained his departure and mentioned that he planned to go with him to Southampton. ""Don't worry. Let the man stay here. He's too exhausted to cause any trouble. I expect he will sleep for a solid eight hours. I'll talk to your trustworthy Mrs. Funnyface and ask her to keep an eye on him."" Dr. Ridgeway quickly left as usual. Poirot swiftly finished packing, keeping an eye on the clock. ""Time flies by so quickly. Hastings, I have left you with a most intriguing mystery. The man from nowhere.""",1
"""Curiously, why did you assume he lost interest in the case?"" Tommy inquired. ""Because of what he said,"" replied Julius dryly. ""The old man is as silent as a clam! Just like the rest of them, he wasn't going to commit until he knew he could deliver."" ""I wonder,"" Tommy mused. Julius looked at him sharply. ""What do you wonder?"" ""If that was his true motive."" ""Of course. Without a doubt."" Tommy remained skeptical. Sir James arrived promptly at eight o'clock, and Julius presented Tommy. Sir James warmly greeted him. ""I'm pleased to meet you, Mr....""",1
"” Upon arriving at our hotel, he signaled for silence and we proceeded to have lunch with great appetite. It was clear to me that Poirot preferred not to discuss the recent tragedy in a public setting. Despite this, the topic weighed heavily on my mind, leaving no room for other conversation. We sat in silence for some time until Poirot slyly remarked, “Well! What about your little slip-ups? Care to share?” My face grew warm as I tried to downplay the morning's events with casual indifference.”",1
"""But little did I know he had connections to you."" Poirot nodded solemnly. ""I am acquainted with Mademoiselle Cynthia. It is thanks to the generosity of Mrs. Inglethorp that I find myself here."" He explained further, ""She provided shelter for seven of my fellow countrymen who have been forced to flee our homeland. The Belgians will forever be indebted to her."" Poirot, a peculiar figure, stood at a mere five feet, four inches, yet exuded an air of authority. His head resembled an egg, tilted slightly to one side, and his military-style mustache remained rigid.",1
"""Sorry, but I have to go,"" she said abruptly before rushing out of the room. It didn't take long before another man entered - a burly figure with a tiny red mustache and pince-nez glasses. ""I'm Dr. Treves,"" he announced. ""Mrs. Templeton couldn't make it, she's not feeling well. Nervous breakdown, you see. Worried about her husband and all. I've given her some medication and advised bed rest. But she insists you stay for dinner, and I'll be your host. Your reputation precedes you, M. Poirot, and we're eager to have you here.""",1
"In this tale, we encounter a cunning and devious woman who is well aware of her husband's financial troubles. She grows weary of her elderly spouse, whom she married solely for his wealth, and hatches a plan to have him take out a sizable life insurance policy.

The following day, believing her husband to be away at sea, she casually remarks on the peculiar story shared the previous evening.",1
"Walking away from each other after a tense exchange, I strolled along Edgware Road (the meeting had occurred in a St. John’s Wood residence) and through Hyde Park towards St. George’s Hospital. Upon arriving, I made my way into Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and purchased a ticket for Gloucester Road. Standing on the platform, I proceeded to the far end. Curiosity drove me to confirm the existence of points and an aperture connecting the two tunnels past the station towards Down Street. To my satisfaction, I was proven correct.",1
"""Poirot added another log to the crackling fire and arranged more comfortable chairs. I set out glasses along with the whisky and soda. The captain eagerly took a sip, nodding in approval. ""Your country's laws are still reliable,"" he remarked. ""But enough small talk,"" Japp interjected. ""Mr. Poirot had a specific favor to ask of me. He was intrigued by an organization known as the Big Four, requesting that I inform him if I ever encountered any references to it during my investigations.""",1
"""But, try as she might, she couldn't grasp any hints from their conversation. Boris and Mrs. Vandemeyer chatted about trivial topics: recent plays, new dance trends, and the latest society rumors. Following dinner, they moved to the cozy boudoir where Mrs. Vandemeyer, lounging on the sofa, appeared even more captivatingly sinister. Tuppence served the coffee and liqueurs before discreetly exiting. Just before leaving, she overheard Boris comment: 'She's new, isn't she?' 'Arrived today. The previous one was a devil. This one seems reliable. She follows orders well.' Tuppence hesitated at the slightly ajar door, catching Boris inquire: 'Are we secure?' 'Oh Boris, you're overly cautious.""",1
"""You understand the nature of women. She's enthusiastic about the film stunt."" ""I see,"" replied Poirot. After a moment of contemplation, he quickly stood up. ""Are you heading back to Yardly Chase immediately? Good! Don't inform anyone except for expecting us there this evening. We will be there shortly after five."" ""Okay, but I'm not sure"" ""It doesn't matter,"" said Poirot kindly. ""You want me to keep your diamond safe, right?"" ""Yes, but"" ""Then just follow my instructions."" A confused nobleman exited the room. We reached Yardly Chase at five-thirty, and were led by the dignified butler to the antique panelled hall with its crackling fire.",1
"The purser conveyed his apologies for her absence in a sincerely manner as he assigned me her room, and afterwards Colonel Race shared some intriguing insights about her. Rumors of her involvement in espionage circulated in Paris, though no evidence was ever found. It appeared that Colonel Race had been deployed to investigate this matter. He disclosed details about a sophisticated criminal network, revealing it to be non-German in nature.",1
"The incident had occurred at Trafalgar Square. “Was it a mere accident, or a premeditated act?” “I cannot say for certain. It could be either.” Walking together, the two young women hastened their pace. “It might just be my imagination,” Tuppence remarked out of the blue, “but I sense a presence trailing behind us.” “Quickly!” whispered the other. “Oh, quickly!” As they reached the intersection of Carlton House Terrace, their mood lifted. Unexpectedly, a tall and visibly drunk man blocked their path. “Good evening, ladies,” he slurred.",1
"""He might have tampered with the curry ingredients,"" I proposed. ""And he made sure to have an alibi, avoiding eating the dish himself."" My deduction seemed to catch Poirot's attention. He regarded me with a newfound respect. ""He comes back home late,"" I speculated, exploring a possible scenario. ""Spots the light in his uncle's study, goes in, and, when his scheme goes awry, shoves the old man into the flames."" ""Mr. Paynter, a robust man of fifty-five, would not go down without a fight, Hastings. Such a scenario is unlikely."" ""We are getting closer, Poirot,"" I exclaimed confidently.",1
"""When they forced the door open, the window was immediately pushed ajar by one of the intruders. The housemaid responsible claimed the window was likely left unfastened. However, her reliability as a witness is questionable at best. As for the key, it was discovered amidst the debris of the broken door. The key could have tumbled out of the keyhole, been deliberately placed by one of the trespassers, or even slid under the door from outside. Uncertainty shrouds every detail, Monsieur Poirot.""",1
"“Hercule,” I inquired, “what substance was contained within this small vial?” Hercule gazed out the window. “Strychnine hydrochloride,” he replied, never missing a beat. My reaction was subdued, as I had anticipated this revelation. “The pure form of strychnine hydrochloride is rarely utilized, primarily for medicinal purposes. The liquid solution is more commonly found in pharmaceuticals, explaining the undisturbed fingerprints.” Curious, I asked, “How were you able to capture this image?” Hercule shrugged nonchalantly, “I simply dropped my hat off the balcony.”",1
"""I heard it was done recently, isn't that right?"" ""Yes, they were working on it yesterday afternoon. But let's go inside, Dorcas is waiting."" ""Well, well! Let me enjoy this sight for a moment."" ""Yes, but we have more pressing matters to discuss."" ""And who's to say these begonias aren't just as important?"" I couldn't argue with him when he was in this mood. ""You don't agree? But history has shown otherwise. Let's go talk to Dorcas."" Dorcas stood in the boudoir, hands folded, with her grey hair tightly pulled back under her cap.",1
"As the Revolution finally subsided, Colonel Race arrived in Cape Town. Following his suggestion, we all moved into the grand villa in Muizenberg once owned by Sir Lawrence Eardsley. Plans were made for my return to England with Suzanne, where we would marry at her London home. The trousseau was to be purchased in Paris, a task that Suzanne took great pleasure in organizing. Despite the excitement, the future appeared strangely distant. At times, a suffocating sensation gripped me, leaving me breathless. On the eve of our departure, sleep eluded me.",1
"Sir James carefully folded the paper and stashed it in his pocket-book before surveying the dimly lit room. ""Our young friend spent quite some time confined here, did they not?"" he remarked. ""A truly sinister place. Note the lack of windows and the solid door. Any activity within these walls would remain hidden from the outside world."" Tuppence felt a chill run down her spine. His words stirred a sense of unease within her. What if there lurked someone inside the house? Someone who could lock them in and abandon them to their fate? The notion struck her as ludicrous.",1
"""It was Mr. Inglethorp of the Hall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a dog.” The wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner’s frown. ""Oh, no, sir of course not. Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter?” Inwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please “The Hall” especially when it might result in custom being transferred from Coot’s to the local establishment. “Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so. “Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?”",1
"""I find the South African climate to be quite delightful."" ""I'm aware of the climate, having been there just before the war."" ""Thank you, Pedler. I'll have the package sent to General Smuts directly. The Kilmorden Castle sets sail on Saturday, a reliable vessel."" We walked along Pall Mall together briefly before saying goodbye. He shook my hand warmly, expressing gratitude once more. As I made my way home, I pondered the intricate paths of governmental decisions.",1
"Other footsteps trailed close behind them. As they approached Sir James's door, Tuppence grasped the bell while Jane took hold of the knocker. The mysterious man who had been following them reached the bottom of the steps, hesitating briefly before the door swung open. With a sense of urgency, they stumbled into the hallway together. Sir James emerged from the library, surprised by the commotion. Stepping forward, he wrapped his arm around Jane to steady her. Leading her into the library, he gently lowered her onto the plush sofa. Sir James reached for a tantalus on the nearby table, pouring a small amount of brandy and coaxing Jane to drink it.",1
"I waited anxiously, but no one appeared. There was no sign of being trailed. I proceeded toward the open space, counting my steps. After six paces, I halted abruptly. A noise came from behind me, not from anyone tailing me, but from someone already present, lurking. Suddenly, a feeling of impending danger washed over me, an instinctual alarm similar to what I experienced on the Kilmorden that fateful evening. I quickly glanced back, only to be met with silence. Continuing forward, the rustle sounded once more. Persisting on my path, I glanced back again.",1
"”She gasped when she noticed the blood-stained tip, her eyes widening in terror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, it is, madame. Your husband met his end at the hands of this very weapon.” Quickly, he concealed it from view. “Are you certain this is the same one that sat on your dressing-table last night?” “Absolutely. It was a gift from my son, who served in the Air Force during the War. He pretended to be older than he was.” Her voice held a hint of pride. “This was crafted from a streamlined aeroplane wire, a memento from my son's time in the War.” “I understand, madame. Which leads us to another issue.",1
"""Alright, let's do this,"" muttered Tommy quietly to himself, echoing his previous statement. ""Oh, no!"" he exclaimed, managing to sit upright this time. Without delay, the German man approached him, offering a glass and instructing him to ""Drink."" Tommy complied. The liquid burned his throat, causing him to cough, yet it brought a sense of clarity to his mind. Tommy found himself on a sofa in the meeting room, flanked by the German on one side and the sinister-looking doorkeeper on the other. The rest of the group stood nearby, but one person was notably absent from the scene.",1
"""But, what if we are correct? Whose side will you choose, Miss Howard?” “I'm not sure, I'm not sure.” “Think about it.” “Maybe it can be kept under wraps.” “No, there must be full disclosure.” “But Emily herself ” She hesitated. “Miss Howard,” Poirot said solemnly, “this is beneath you.” Suddenly, she lifted her face from her hands. “Yes,” she stated calmly, “that was not Evelyn Howard speaking!” She raised her head proudly. “This is Evelyn Howard! And she stands for Justice! No matter the consequences.” And with those words, she exited the room confidently. “There,” Poirot remarked, watching her leave, “walks a truly valuable ally.”",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had captivated Paris, gracefully acknowledged the applause and disappeared backstage. Her dressing room was filled with bouquets and luxurious garments, as Jeanne, her dresser, chattered on. A knock at the door interrupted them. The mysterious Count Sergius Paulovitch had arrived, a man of elegance and weariness. Switching to English, they discussed the 'Colonel,' a criminal mastermind planning his retirement. Nadina revealed her plan to travel to London incognito, arousing the Count's curiosity. He mentioned a fortune teller's prophecy about the 'Colonel's' downfall involving a woman, sparking Nadina's interest. They speculated on the 'Colonel's' future and the mysteries that lay ahead.",1
"Surprisingly, my conscience suddenly became restless. It kept bothering me, reminding me of my Aunt Jane living way out West. The thought of her troubled me deeply. I had a feeling that Amos Finn was not going to turn his life around. So, I made a decision to hire someone to track her down. Unfortunately, the outcome was grim - both Aunt Jane and Amos Finn were found dead. However, they had a daughter named Jane who had survived the Lusitania disaster on her way to Paris. Despite her survival, no one on this side of the ocean seemed to know about her whereabouts. Feeling impatient with the lack of progress, I decided to take matters into my own hands and travel over to speed things up.",1
"""Just as you prefer,"" Tommy answered. ""I understand it's trendy to criticize the police. I personally have faith in them."" He appeared completely relaxed. Tommy Beresford belonged to that category of young Englishmen lacking any exceptional intellectual prowess, yet excelling in challenging situations. Their innate shyness and carefulness vanish when under pressure. Tommy was fully aware that his only hope for survival rested in his own cleverness, and beneath his calm demeanor, he was frantically brainstorming.",1
"""The issue you wish to discuss with him is grave?” “Absolutely! Last night, my uncle, who is my closest friend, was brutally murdered.” “Here in the city?” “No, in Yorkshire. I was in town when my wife sent me a telegram this morning. As soon as I received it, I decided to come and ask Monsieur Poirot to handle the investigation.” “Excuse me for a moment,” I interjected, struck by a sudden thought. I hurried upstairs and quickly briefed Poirot on the matter. He anticipated my next words. “I understand. You want to lead the investigation yourself, correct? Well, why not? You are familiar with my techniques by now.",1
"""Surely there's a hidden escape route. Join me in the search,"" I suggested, taking a step back inside. Innocently, Poirot began to follow me. Suddenly, a realization hit me like a ton of bricks. I was betraying him, playing the role of Judas. ""Stop, Poirot!"" I yelled. ""Go back. It's a setup. Save yourself. Forget about me. Escape now."" Before I could finish my warning, strong hands seized me. A Chinese servant darted forward, aiming to capture Poirot.",1
"""Given the later time of the crime, suspicion is deflected from the culprit. An interruption by Bella causes frustration and hastens his actions. Madame Renauld is bound and gagged, a mistake from the past corrected. The culprit's escape route is staged, leading to their own demise. The investigation unravels two crimes, one solved and the other a deeper mystery. Poirot's methodical approach triumphs over Giraud's incompetence. Madame Renauld's strength and deception to protect her son are commendable. The lead piping serves a sinister purpose, revealing the true killer. The focus shifts to Jack Renauld as the prime suspect. The mystery deepens with the discovery of the dagger.""",1
"""Given the timing of the crime, suspicion cannot be cast on him. His annoyance at the unexpected visit from Bella is evident, but he quickly gets rid of her. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, rectifying his past mistake. The night is cold as he buries the dead man, leaving clues against himself. His plan unravels when justice catches up to him. The unraveling of the case has been both perplexing and baffling. Poirot's brilliance shines through as he outwits his rivals. Madame Renauld's silent suffering reveals her strength as she protects her son's secret. The lead piping was used to disguise the victim's identity, a clue that led Poirot in the right direction. Now, the focus shifts to finding out who truly killed M. Renauld.""",1
"Lawrence Cavendish was next called to the witness stand. When questioned by Mr. Philips, he refuted any claims of ordering from Parkson's in June, stating he was in Wales on June 29th. Sir Ernest, however, pressed on aggressively, accusing him of ordering a black beard. The mention of inheritance brought a flush to Lawrence's face, drawing disapproval from the judge. The prisoner's anger was evident, but Heavywether remained unfazed by it all.",1
"""Poirot gestured gracefully, a faint smile playing on his lips. “No need to fret, Mr. Cavendish. It's too late now. I am certain that you would find it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to replace it by now.” “But do you think-” “I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his favour. That is all.” John appeared puzzled. “Do not worry,” said Poirot smoothly. “I assure you that you need not let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some breakfast.” The dining-room was filled with all present.""",1
"""‘Doc,’ I said, attempting to rise from the bed, only to be met with a sharp pain in my right foot. ‘Just a minor sprain,’ the doctor reassured me. ‘You’ll be back on your feet in a couple of days.’” Tuppence chimed in, “I could tell you were limping.” Julius acknowledged and went on, “‘How did the accident occur?’ I inquired once more. He responded wryly, ‘You stumbled, along with a sizable chunk of one of my trees, into a flower-bed I had just planted.’ I found myself liking him. He appeared to possess a sense of humor. I was confident that he, at least, was honest. ‘Of course, doc,’ I said, ‘I apologize for the tree, and I’ll cover the cost of the new bulbs.’""",1
"""She recounts the letter, along with the story of Mr. Ryland's anger. You jot it down, pondering the neatly organized cipher, challenging yet manageable. After deciphering it, you summon me."" ""Little do they realize, I have been anticipating this moment. I quickly approach Japp and make arrangements. And thus, you witness my triumph!"" I expressed my dissatisfaction with Poirot, making it clear. We traveled back to London on a milk train during the wee hours, a journey filled with discomfort.",1
"“I recognize the name, but it doesn’t ring a bell right now. What does she do?” “I’m not sure, but take a look at her picture.” After a brief moment of inspection, Mr. Aarons exclaimed, “I remember now!” He enthusiastically patted his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, of course!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “Yes, they are a duo of sisters. They perform as acrobats, dancers, and singers. Quite talented. They’re currently touring in the provinces, or possibly taking a break. I think they just finished a run in Paris.” “Could you please find out their exact location for me?” “No problem. Just head home, and I’ll have the information for you in the morning.”",1
"""As usual, Poirot was right. I suppose you will provide a detailed explanation there, allowing the authorities a complete description of Number Four. But what good will it do? Can we offer anything that will sway a coroner's jury of your steadfast British citizens? Is our account of Number Four truly significant? No; they will likely label it as 'Accidental Death,' and perhaps, despite my doubts, our cunning killer will congratulate himself for outsmarting Hercule Poirot from the start.""",1
"""Your presence here tonight, Beresford, comes as quite a surprise to me. The last I knew, your friends were deeply concerned about your well-being. Miss Tuppence feared you had encountered some trouble."" Tommy smirked, ""Oh, I certainly did, sir! I found myself in quite a pickle."" With prompting from Sir James, he recounted his escapades in brief. The lawyer's curiosity was piqued as Tommy finished his story. ""You managed to extricate yourself admirably from a perilous situation,"" he remarked solemnly. ""Congratulations.""",1
"""Did I mention what caused Monsieur Lawrence to go as white as a sheet upon entering his mother's room that fateful night? It was the sight of the unbolted door leading to Mademoiselle Cynthia's room while his mother lay poisoned, visible over your shoulder."" ""But he claimed he saw it bolted!"" I protested. ""Precisely,"" Poirot responded dryly. ""That only solidified my belief that it was not. He was protecting Mademoiselle Cynthia."" ""But what reason would he have to protect her?"" ""Because he is smitten with her."" I chuckled.",1
"That evening, Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a man, who refused to give his name, wanted to speak with me privately. Wary of insurance agents, I instructed Jarvis to turn him away. Guy Pagett, typically reliable, was unfortunately unwell with a bilious attack. It seemed that the hard-working young men often fell victim to such ailments. When Jarvis returned, he revealed, ""The man says he is here on behalf of Mr. Milray."" This unexpected connection changed everything.",1
"""She lowered her gaze, seemingly filled with shame, and whispered in a trembling voice: “You can't, you can't... not if you knew.” Then, with sudden determination, she looked me straight in the eye and demanded: “What do you know?” “I know you visited Mr. Renauld that evening. He offered you a check which you tore up in a fit of rage. After that, you left the premises.” I hesitated. “What happened next?” “I'm not sure if you were expecting Jack Renauld to arrive that night, or if you simply lingered in the hopes of seeing him, but linger you did. Perhaps you were feeling lost and wandered aimlessly, but regardless, just before midnight, you were still in the vicinity and spotted a figure on the golf course.” Once more, I fell silent.""",1
"""I'm about to share a different side of the story,"" I declared confidently. Harry's attention was unwavering as I detailed the same sequence of events chronicled in this book. The most shocking revelation for him was the revelation that the diamonds had been in Suzanne's possession all this time, a fact that had completely eluded him. After hearing his version of events, I finally understood the purpose behind Carton's clever scheme, or rather Nadina's, as I was convinced it was her ingenious plan all along. It became clear that no surprise attacks against her or her husband would lead to the recovery of the diamonds.",1
"Danvers was a very clever man. The German hesitated before mentioning Danvers. ""Danvers,"" he whispered. After a moment of silence, he signaled to Conrad. ""Take him upstairs,"" he ordered. ""Wait,"" Tommy interjected. ""What about the girl?"" The German promised to consider it. ""Only one person can decide,"" he explained. Tommy knew who that person was. ""Mr. Brown,"" he stated. ""Can I speak to him?"" he inquired. Conrad gestured for Tommy to follow him upstairs. In a small room on the next floor, Tommy entered.",1
"His expression remained stoic, perpetuating the unsettling aura that enveloped him. Mrs. Inglethorp descended the stairs last, her demeanor still marked by unease. A tense quiet settled over the meal, with Inglethorp notably subdued. Contrary to his usual behavior of doting on his wife, he sat in silence. Following supper, Mrs. Inglethorp retreated to her boudoir once more, requesting her coffee be brought to her. Cynthia and I settled by the window in the drawing-room, where Mary Cavendish delivered our coffee, her demeanor betraying a sense of anticipation.",1
"I woke up from a nightmare, a horrifying one where she was in grave danger. Alarmed, I rushed to her room to check on her safety. To my dismay, she was nowhere to be found, and her bed appeared untouched. She gazed at me with concern. ""What do you suggest, Sir Eustace?"" Tempted to respond with a dismissive remark, I instead furrowed my brow thoughtfully. ""Just go to bed, and try not to fret unnecessarily. A capable young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is more than capable of looking after herself."" I inquired, ""What is Race's opinion on this matter?"" It was time to challenge Race's authority and allow him to experience both the benefits and drawbacks of female company. ""I've searched everywhere for him.",1
"“Hey, look at this, this, and this!” “Oh my goodness! Please be careful with those valuable items!” “They're not just valuable items. They're worth five times more than that, and this one is even better!” Tommy sighed. “I must have been out of my mind! Am I hallucinating, Tuppence, or is there actually a significant amount of five-pound notes being flaunted recklessly?” “Exactly, my dear! Now, shall we go grab some lunch?” “I'm up for it. But what on earth have you been up to? Robbing a bank?” “All in due time. Piccadilly Circus is such a dreadful place.”",1
"""Tommy eagerly approached the girl. “You must know something about her?” She turned away abruptly. “I know nothing, only the name,” she said before walking towards the door. Suddenly, she let out a cry. Tommy watched as she caught sight of the picture he had left against the wall the night before. A look of terror flashed in her eyes, only to be quickly replaced by relief. Without a word, she left the room. Tommy was left puzzled by her reaction. Did she think he intended to harm her with the picture? He hung it back on the wall, deep in thought.""",1
"She led us to her inner chamber, where we met her partner in crime, a rather imposing figure, whom Cynthia affectionately called “Nibs.” “So many containers!” I remarked, scanning the compact space. “Do you truly remember the contents of each one?” “Try to be more original,” Cynthia groaned. “Everyone who visits here says that. We’re actually considering giving a reward to the first person who doesn’t say: ‘So many containers!’ And I bet your next question is going to be: ‘How many victims have you claimed?’” I chuckled, admitting my guilt.",1

"“Marrying for money is my best shot,” Tuppence stated matter-of-factly. She had decided on this course of action at a young age. “I’m not one for sentimentality.” Tommy agreed, denying any sentimentality in Tuppence. “You never come across as sentimental,” he added quickly. Tuppence expressed her readiness to marry a wealthy man, lamenting the financial state of the men she knew. Tommy suggested the general as a potential match.",1
"He appeared to be around fifty years old, his once dark hair now peppered with strands of grey. With a clean-shaven face, his long, narrow nose and closely set eyes gave him a stern appearance. The deep bronzed complexion hinted at a life spent under tropical suns. As his lips curled back in a grimace of shock and fear, Poirot noted, ""It's clear from his expression that he was attacked from behind."" With great care, he rolled the lifeless body over, revealing a dark stain between the shoulder blades on the light fawn overcoat.",1
"""I am quite famished,"" she whispered. ""Excellent. You're at the purser's table, correct? Confront him about the cabin."" Making my way to the saloon, I started to eat cautiously and ended up devouring a massive meal. My acquaintance from the day before commended me on my improved appetite. He informed me that everyone was changing cabins that day and assured me that my belongings would be transferred to an exterior one promptly. Our table consisted of only four individuals: myself, two older women, and a zealous missionary who frequently discussed ""our impoverished black brethren.""",1
"At half past six, a disguised Miss Howard arrives at the chemist’s shop pretending to be Alfred Inglethorp. She fabricates a story about a dog in order to acquire the deadly strychnine. With precision, she forges Alfred Inglethorp's name in John's handwriting, a skill she had meticulously practiced beforehand. To ensure John cannot provide an alibi, she cleverly crafts an anonymous note in his handwriting, luring him to a secluded location where his presence would go unnoticed. With her plan coming together seamlessly, Miss Howard departs for Middlingham while Alfred Inglethorp makes his way back to Styles.",1
"Poirot was perplexed as he tried to unravel the mystery surrounding M. Renauld's murder. The commissary and magistrate were discussing the conflicting testimonies of Françoise and Denise, while Poirot examined a worn letter found in the pocket of the dead man's overcoat. The letter, written in English, contained threats from a woman named Bella, indicating a love triangle that may have led to the crime. Poirot noted that the stab in the back was likely done by a man, adding a new layer of complexity to the case. The magistrate suggested reaching out to authorities in Santiago to uncover more about M. Renauld's past. As they delved deeper into the investigation, Poirot remained focused on finding the true motive behind the murder.",1
"""At a loss for answers, I complied. Transportation options in Elmer's Dale were scarce. The rundown local garage housed a pair of beat-up Ford cars, along with two station wagons. None of these had been used on the day of interest.

Typically, one of the Fords was available at the station in case it was needed.""",1
"The dirty wallpaper, now unrecognizable, drooped in tattered strips from the ceiling. Cobwebs filled every corner. Tommy advanced slowly. As he turned the corner of the staircase, he caught the sound of the man below entering a room. He seemed to be free of suspicion so far. Asking for ""Mr. Brown"" when he arrived at the house seemed like a logical and innocent action. Pausing at the top of the stairs, Tommy pondered his next step. A narrow hallway stretched out before him, with doors on each side. The closest door on the left emitted a faint murmur of conversation.",1
"I must admit that after the first jolt of the Kilmorden, I quickly retreated below deck. A kind stewardess took me in, recommending dry toast and ginger ale. For three days, I remained confined to my cabin, consumed by misery. My passion for solving mysteries had vanished, leaving behind a shell of the once eager Anne who had rushed to South Kensington. Now, as I reflect on my return, I can't help but smile at the memory of Mrs. Flemming in the drawing-room, waiting to speak with me.",1
"""But you are quite the cunning one. You seek my assistance yet leave behind the crimson herring on the path."" Japp erupted in laughter. ""That's your signature move, Mr. Poirot. Yes, I'd place my bet on the Chink, I confess. It only makes sense that he tampered with the curry, and if he attempted once to remove his master from the equation, he may attempt again."" ""I ponder if he would,"" murmured Poirot. ""But it's the underlying reason that perplexes me. Perhaps some form of heathen vengeance."" ""I ponder,"" Poirot repeated. ""There hasn't been a theft? Nothing has vanished? No gems, nor cash, nor documents?"" ""No, not precisely.",1
"I rolled my eyes. There was no use arguing with him when he got like this. It occurred to me, not for the first time, that Poirot was starting to show his age. Thankfully, I was there to balance out his fading faculties. Poirot watched me with a twinkle in his eye. “You're not happy with me, my friend?” “Poirot,” I replied icily, “I would never presume to tell you what to do. You're entitled to your own opinions, just as I am to mine.” “A most commendable attitude,” Poirot said, standing up quickly.",1
"“I am quite superstitious. Luck, fate, all that jazz. It seems like destiny has singled you out to be involved in all of this.” Tommy let out a chuckle. “Goodness me! I can only imagine Whittington’s reaction when Tuppence dropped that name! I would have been startled myself. But listen, sir, we’ve been taking up so much of your time. Do you have any advice for us before we head out?” “I believe not. My specialists, following ordinary procedures, have not succeeded. You will need to bring creativity and an open mind to the mission. Even if that doesn't work, don’t lose hope. There’s a chance things will escalate quickly.” Tuppence looked puzzled.",1
"""Evidently, he was correct!” With tears welling up, she bid us a composed goodbye. Poirot, walking alongside me, made his usual gesture. “Well, that settles it! Let's return to London, my dear friend, as it seems there is no mystery to solve here. But” “But what?” “Just a small inconsistency, nothing more! Did you catch it? No? Nonetheless, discrepancies are common in life, and certainly the man did not commit suicide, as there is no poison that would result in blood in his mouth.""",1

"Poirot's demeanor was unpredictable, shifting between quiet contemplation and lively engagement. At times, he would gaze out the window as though lost in thought, completely ignoring my attempts at conversation. Then, without warning, he would become animated again, bombarding me with instructions and emphasizing the importance of frequent telegrams. A long period of silence fell over us shortly after passing Woking. Although the train was non-stop to Southampton, it happened to pause momentarily due to a signal. ""Ah! Sacré mille tonnerres!"" exclaimed Poirot out of nowhere. ""I have been a fool. Everything is clear to me now.""",1

Death results from the paralysis of the respiratory center.' ""Do you understand now, Hastings? From the start, I had a suspicion of the truth when Japp mentioned a living man being pushed into the flames.""",1
"""It appears highly probable that Pagett is responsible for the murder of Anita Grünberg in Marlow, adding credibility to the idea that he is indeed the elusive 'Colonel.' Given the sensitive nature of Anita's work, it seems unlikely that she would confide in a subordinate. The only factor contradicting this hypothesis is the failed attempt on your life the night you arrived here. Pagett was clearly left in Cape Town, making it impossible for him to have reached this location before the following Wednesday. It is doubtful that he has any associates in this area, as all his preparations were made to intercept you in Cape Town.""",1
"“No, I promised myself that I would care for you better than anyone else could. No one ever visits this secluded island. I convinced old Batani, who I once helped recover from a fever, to come and take care of you. She is trustworthy and will never betray us. I could hide you here for months and no one would suspect a thing.” The thought of those words brought me satisfaction. “You made the right decision,” I assured calmly. “I won’t reach out to anyone. A few more days of uncertainty won’t change much. After all, they are not my own kin.”",1
"I was no stranger to the stage, having acted extensively during my years at Cambridge. It was a simple matter for me to assume the persona of a solemn, mature gentleman with a full beard. During the voyage, I made a point of avoiding Carton, feigning illness and secluding myself in my cabin. Once we arrived in London, I had no trouble tracking his movements. Carton checked into a hotel and remained indoors until the next day. At nearly one o’clock, he emerged and I discreetly followed him to a real estate agent's office in Knightsbridge.",1
"I motioned for her to take a seat on the couch and urged her to share her troubles. She divulged every detail to me, taking care to not leave anything out. After I had listened intently, she let out a heavy breath. Surprisingly, she didn't react the way I had anticipated. Instead of scolding or criticizing, she simply chuckled and remarked, ""You know, Anne, you're quite an extraordinary young woman. Have you never felt any doubts?"" Perplexed, I inquired, ""Doubts?"" She repeated, ""Yes, doubts, doubts, doubts! Venturing out on your own with barely a penny to your name. What will you do if you end up in a foreign land with no money left?"" ""There's no use worrying about that until it happens,"" I replied.",1
"""I basked in the satisfaction of knowing that Marchaud considered me as significant as Poirot. The girl awaited my arrival, her reaction effusive upon spotting the key in my possession. “You have it then?” she exclaimed. “Naturally,” I replied calmly. “Nonetheless, what I am about to do is rather unorthodox.” “You have been most helpful, and I will remember it. Let us proceed. Are we shielded from view by the house?” “Just a moment.” I halted her eager progression. “I will not impede you if you truly desire to enter. But do you? You have observed the grave, the grounds, and have been briefed on all aspects of the case.""",1
"I greeted her politely and asked, “Is Dr. Bauerstein available?” She looked at me with a solemn expression. “Haven’t you heard?” I inquired, “Heard what?” She replied, “About him.” “What happened to him?” I pressed. She answered, “He's been taken.” “Taken? Dead?” I questioned. “No, taken by the authorities,” she clarified. “Arrested?” I exclaimed. She confirmed, “Yes, that's correct,” and without hesitation, I rushed to find Poirot. Much to my dismay, Poirot was not there, and the elderly Belgian man who opened the door informed me that he had likely traveled to London. I was left speechless.",1
"He managed to have the case thrown out, but it resulted in two young men being ruined and publicly shamed as thieves. It shattered the old man's heart. After a bitter confrontation with his son, he disowned him completely. The son, in his pride, chose to remain silent, refusing to defend his innocence to his father. Enraged after the encounter, he met up with his friend, and a week later they both enlisted in the war together. Tragically, his friend was killed due to reckless behavior. The man's death was a devastating blow, leaving his reputation tarnished forever.",1
"""But I noticed his eyes darting around the room. ""Where is my associate?"" ""He's here, both of you are ensnared by the Big Four."" He chuckled. ""A trap?"" Poirot questioned. ""Haven't you figured it out yet?"" ""I understand that there's a trap, yes,"" Poirot replied softly. ""But you're mistaken, sir. It's you who's caught, not me and my associate."" ""What?"" Ryland raised the large gun, but I saw uncertainty in his eyes. ""If you pull that trigger, you'll be committing murder under the watch of ten pairs of eyes, and you'll face the gallows.

I am inquiring whether you are familiar with an individual by the name of Li Chang Yen?"" ""Well, that's quite peculiar. How did you come across this name?"" ""So, you do know of him?"" ""I have had the pleasure of meeting him once. While I am not as well-informed as I would like to be, it is surprising to hear of anyone else in England who is aware of him. He holds quite a prestigious position as a mandarin, but that is not the most crucial aspect. It is highly likely that he is the mastermind behind everything.""",1
"I clutched the note in my hand, heart pounding. The words were brief but filled with urgency: “We must meet in the clearing by the palm gully. Remember Cabin 17. - Harry Rayburn.” A shiver ran down my spine. Harry was close, I could feel it. Wrapping a scarf around my head, I crept towards the door, cautious of prying eyes. He was a wanted man, and our meeting had to remain a secret. Passing Suzanne's room, I heard her gentle snores. Sir Eustace's door loomed ahead, my next destination.",1
"""From the outset, I harbored a strong aversion towards him, and I pride myself on my astute initial assessments.

'No, I worked at Lloyd's before the war.' 'Will you go back there once the war ends?' 'Maybe. Or I might seek a completely new beginning.' Mary Cavendish leaned in.""",1

""Especially when you go from being in love with one woman to proposing to another in just two weeks.""   Julius looked sheepish. ""I just felt like I was never going to find Jane, and that maybe all this love stuff was just a waste of time. The French, now they have the right idea about separating romance from marriage.""   Tommy's face turned red with anger.",1
"Poirot studied me carefully, giving advice to stick to my words. He mentioned arranging a marriage for me, but I declined. Poirot, obsessed with neatness, asked about Mademoiselle Cinderella's whereabouts. Despite my misgivings, I followed Poirot's lead, knowing he had a keen eye for human nature. As he left for Paris, I pondered his mysterious insights. I decided to inquire about Cinderella at the Hôtel du Phare, but to my surprise, she was not there. The concierge denied her presence, hinting at Poirot's earlier visit. His description matched Poirot's, confirming his secret investigation.",1
"As we raced against time to outsmart the cunning Andrew Marsh, our efforts proved futile and his niece remained in peril. Rushing to the station, we managed to board a train bound for London, albeit not the fastest one. Poirot appeared dejected, while I struggled to stay awake in my seat. Suddenly, near Taunton, Poirot let out a sharp cry. ""Quick, Hastings! Wake up and jump! Jump, I tell you!"" In a daze, we found ourselves on the platform, without our belongings, watching the train vanish into the darkness. Anger boiled inside me, but Poirot remained unfazed.",1
"Nonetheless, due to its global infamy, my dear friend Poirot and the family have urged me to pen the complete tale. It is our hope that this will put an end to the wild rumors that continue to circulate. Let me briefly outline the events that led to my involvement. Returning from the Front, I found myself in a dreary Convalescent Home before being granted a month's sick leave. With no close ties, I pondered my next move until I crossed paths with John Cavendish.",1
"My tasks presented no challenges at all. In a previous chapter of my life, I served as the confidential assistant to a bustling politician, therefore the responsibilities were not new to me. Mr. Ryland often hosted a sizeable gathering over the weekend, however the weekdays were typically calm. I had limited interaction with Mr. Appleby, the American aide, though he appeared to be a friendly and capable young man. On the other hand, I crossed paths more frequently with Miss Martin, the typist.",1
"""Tell me what you know,"" Mr. Carter's presence was commanding. Tuppence hesitated before responding, ""We can't reveal everything, right Tommy?"" Yet Tommy remained silent, his attention fixed on Mr. Carter with unexpected respect. ""We may not have much to offer, sir. But whatever we have is yours,"" Tommy finally spoke, surprising Tuppence. She looked at Tommy in shock as Mr. Carter turned to face them. A silent question lingered in his eyes. Tommy nodded. ""I knew it was you from the start, sir,"" he admitted.",1
"Mr. MacAdam was completely unaware of these precautions. Being a fearless man himself, he would likely remove them without a second thought.

As he turned to me with concern, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of relief that he was there to protect me. His presence was both comforting and intimidating, a stark contrast to the chaos that had just unfolded. My heart raced as I watched him deal with the fallen enemy, his actions swift and decisive. In that moment, I knew that I was in the presence of someone who would stop at nothing to keep me safe. And as we stood there on the deck, surrounded by darkness and uncertainty, I felt a sense of gratitude towards Rayburn, the unlikely hero who had come to my rescue.",1
"""As I've mentioned before,"" I said firmly. ""Your character is too pure and genuine to successfully deceive anyone, including yourself. It was only a matter of time before they saw through you and used you as bait. By the way, have you noticed if the girl has red hair?""   ""If you're referring to Miss Martin,"" I replied icily. ""Her hair is more of an auburn shade.""  ""These individuals are quite impressive,"" he mused. ""They've clearly done their homework on you. Miss Martin played a key role in their scheme, that's for sure.""",1
"I had encountered many individuals in my time, some I had found intriguing, while others left me indifferent. However, none had quite the same air as Mr. Chichester. As I pondered this, Sir Eustace Pedler walked past us on the deck. As he reached Mr. Chichester, he bent down to retrieve a fallen piece of paper, casually handing it back with the simple words, ""You've dropped something."" Without a second glance, Sir Eustace continued on his way, seemingly unaware of the effect his actions had on Mr. Chichester. But I noticed. The sight of that paper seemed to stir something deep within him, his face paling as he balled it up in his hand.",1

The mysterious dying message left behind by the elderly man was initially dismissed as ramblings of a confused mind.

As the story unfolded, the inquest brought about even more unexpected twists and turns.""",1
"”One moment,” he paused, then continued, “It's no shock to me. We are just four miles away from the shore.”  “The shore?” I inquired, confused. “How does that factor in?”  Poirot shrugged. “Isn't it clear?”  “Not to me. I must be thick, but I don't see the connection between the coast and Mrs. Inglethorp's murder.” “Absolutely nothing,” Poirot agreed, smiling. “We were discussing Dr. Bauerstein's arrest.” “Wait, he's being arrested for Mrs. Inglethorp's murder?” “What?” Poirot exclaimed, feigning surprise.",1
"Once I managed to escape from the mental institution, I sensed a shift within me, as if a part of me that had long been dormant was reawakening. ""I was assigned to attend to Mr. Beresford. (Back then, I was unaware of his identity.) I was wary, suspecting it might be a setup. Yet, his demeanor appeared genuine, almost too genuine to trust. Still, I remained cautious with my words, mindful that we might be under surveillance. There exists a tiny opening near the ceiling, allowing for eavesdropping.

Let’s go, we’ll apprehend the perpetrator soon.” With determination, he sprinted after the elusive figure. I trailed behind, yet despite our thorough search, we discovered no signs of any individual passing through. Upon our return, Poirot was already busy implementing his unique methods to guarantee his own protection.",1
"The young woman, with a ghoulish mind, was fascinated by the gruesome details of the murder case. Despite my initial disapproval, I found myself reluctantly intrigued by her morbid curiosity. As we entered the shed where the body lay, her high spirits vanished, replaced by horror. She had ignored my warnings, and now she was paying the price. I showed her the victim's fatal wound, a dagger protruding from his back, which caused her to faint. Rushing to her aid, I fetched water and brandy to revive her, realizing that she had underestimated the reality of the crime scene. After she recovered, she begged me to take her away from the scene of death, shaken to her core by what she had witnessed.",1
"He managed to get the case dismissed, but it destroyed the lives of two young men, staining their reputation as thieves. The father disowned his son, unable to bear the betrayal of the family name. The son, in his pride, remained silent, refusing to defend his innocence. Enraged, he enlisted in the war with his friend, who tragically lost his life due to reckless behavior. The father's bitterness towards a woman stemmed from his friend's deeper connection to her, leading to a series of events that awakened a sense of justice in him.",1
"“This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with your head if I’m at all displeased with you!’ Miss Cynthia, she was what they call an Apache, or some such name a Frenchified sort of cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You’d never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.”  “These evenings must have been great fun,” said Poirot genially. “I suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he was Shah of Persia?”  “He did have a beard, sir,” replied Dorcas, smiling.”",1
"""The work can wait,"" he stated firmly. Suddenly, his attention shifted to the issue of an additional cabin. ""There's no space for work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It's overflowing with trunks,"" he exclaimed. His disdain for the trunks was palpable, as if they were unwanted pests. I tried to lighten the mood by reminding him of the necessity of packing extra clothing when traveling. He responded with his usual weak smile, brushing off my attempt at humor and returning to the task at hand.",1
"""Indeed,"" I replied with a heavy heart. ""I hold myself responsible for the tragic turn of events. My companion was deeply disturbed by what she witnessed, almost fainting on the spot. I provided her with brandy and water, then escorted her safely back to town. Unfortunately, in my haste, I neglected to secure the door until my return to the Villa."" The commissary interjected, ""So, for a minimum of twenty minutes..."" I nodded in agreement, ""Precisely, twenty minutes,"" confirming his observation. M. Hautet chimed in, his tone once again stern, ""This situation is truly lamentable, unprecedented."" Suddenly, a new voice entered the conversation, ""You express regret, M.",1
"""But what was your motive?"" ""Ah, simply to test their resemblance,"" he replied. Placing them next to each other on the table, he added, ""And indeed, they are identical."" I nodded in agreement, ""Yes, indeed, identical."" Poirot observed them from a different angle. ""They do appear so, I must admit. However, one must not assume any detail until it is verified. Please fetch my scales,"" he requested. Delicately, he weighed the two pieces, then turned to me with a triumphant expression. ""I was correct. You see, I was correct.

For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance.” “And that is?” “A woman’s happiness, mon ami,” he said gravely. I did not quite know what to say. “The moment has come,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “and I do not know what to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one but I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!” And he tapped himself proudly on the chest.",1
"""I'm certain of that,” Japp whispered. “I'm deeply grateful to you. It would have been a complete mess to arrest him.” He faced Inglethorp. “But, if you don't mind me asking, sir, why didn't you mention all this during the inquest?” “I'll explain why,” Poirot interjected. “There was a certain gossip” “A highly malicious and completely false one,” Alfred Inglethorp interjected, sounding anxious. “And Mr. Inglethorp was keen on avoiding any scandal resurfacing at this time. Am I correct?” “Absolutely.” Inglethorp confirmed.",1

""I apologize for imposing mine on you,"" I responded, ""but I had no say in the matter."" Surprisingly, his eyes sparkled slightly. ""None at all.

""Mr. Milray has instructed me to assist you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your aide."" ""I already have a personal assistant,"" I replied. ""I have no need for another."" ""I beg to differ, Sir Eustace. I believe you do.""",1
"I had always felt his animosity towards me. But now, the tables had turned. I was no longer the one in control, watching from the shadows. Fear began to creep in as I realized I was the target now. I had always been the obstacle in their grand plan, and I feared they would eliminate me without a second thought. Despite Harry Rayburn's past help, I knew the odds were stacked against me. Enemies lurked in every corner, closing in with each passing moment.",1
"I never planned on dressing up, but seeing Pagett so uncomfortable was too good to resist. ""What are you talking about?"" I asked. ""We're definitely wearing costumes. You too."" Pagett hesitated. ""Then go check out the costumes at the barber shop,"" I instructed. ""I hope they have your size,"" Pagett mumbled, eyeing me up and down. Sometimes, without realizing it, Pagett can be quite rude.

So engrossed were we that we arrived at Calais station without even noticing. “Good heavens!” exclaimed my fellow traveler.",1
"Surely he must know that we suspected him. Did he feel fear stirring within him, or was he confident that his crime would go unnoticed? The suspicion in the air surely indicated that he was a marked man. But did Mrs. Cavendish suspect him as well?

Yet, her face could also be inscrutable like that of a sphinx when she chose.",1
"I had been stuck in that room for what felt like an eternity. The glass was my only hope of escape. It took forever, but I finally managed to saw through the cords binding my wrists. Once free, I cautiously made my way out of the room and down the staircase, where I overheard a conversation between my Dutch friend and Mr. Chichester. They were discussing something about a girl who knew too much and needed to be taken care of. I quickly retreated to the attic to avoid being caught eavesdropping. It was clear that danger lurked in that house, and I needed to find a way out before it was too late.",1

Despite the risks, my insatiable curiosity drove me forward. Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself and pressed on, determined to uncover the secrets hidden within the walls of the mysterious house.",1
"Poirot accused me of having an overactive imagination, but now I realized he was even more fantastical than I had ever been. Did he truly believe these ice shards were lethal crystals?

He gazed at me briefly before bursting into an odd chuckle. ""Ah, my dear friend Hastings! Your knowledge knows no bounds! They say Inquire Within Upon Everything. That's you, Hastings.""

"""At the port of Holyhead, I attempted to board a carriage with seemingly respectable individuals, but oddly enough, a throng of people surrounded me, forcibly guiding me in a direction I did not wish to go. The situation felt eerie and unsettling. Eventually, I reluctantly settled into a carriage occupied by Mrs. Vandemeyer. Despite my initial reluctance, I ventured into the corridor, only to discover that all other compartments were already occupied. I resigned myself to return to my seat. However, I found solace in the fact that there were other passengers in the carriage, including a pleasant-looking couple seated across from me.""",1
"Upon reflection, I began to suspect that the entire situation was orchestrated by my adversaries. However, I decided that a trip to the hospital couldn't hurt. It seemed likely that this was not a well-thought-out plan, but rather a set-up. The dying man would share some crucial information with me, leading me straight into the clutches of the notorious gang, the Big Four. I resolved to keep an open mind, pretending to believe what I was told while remaining vigilant. Upon my arrival at St. Giles' Hospital, I was promptly escorted to the accident ward to speak with the man in question.",1
"""Given the timing of the crime, suspicion will not fall on him. His irritation when Bella unexpectedly arrives is clear. He quickly gets rid of her to focus on his plans. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, ensuring she sticks to their story. He carefully covers his tracks, leaving clues that point back to him. He meets a grim fate on the golf links. The murder of M. Renauld has been solved, but a deeper mystery remains. Poirot's brilliance shines as he unravels the truth behind the crime. Madame Renauld's strength and sacrifice are commendable. The lead piping was meant to conceal the victim's identity. Now, the focus shifts to finding the real killer.""",1
"“But did you really believe her when she said the letters were destroyed? Women never destroy letters if they can help it. It’s not in their nature.” “I know, I know,” I replied, feeling my frustration growing. “But you’ve completely embarrassed me! From start to finish! No, it’s easy to come up with excuses after the fact. There has to be a line somewhere!” “You were having such a good time, my friend. I couldn’t bring myself to ruin it for you.” “It doesn’t matter. You’ve crossed a line this time.” “Oh dear! Why do you get so worked up over nothing, my friend?” “I’ve had enough!” I stormed out, slamming the door behind me.",1
"Inglethorp did. You will notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and subsequently with two correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it in a sentence, thus: ‘I am possessed.’ Now, what did that tell me? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind, the possibility of a will (a document almost certain to contain that word) occurred to me at once. This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance.",1
"Speeding away from London in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, Havering explained the situation to Captain Hastings. Hunter’s Lodge, where the tragedy occurred, was a small shooting-box in the Derbyshire moors. Havering's real home was near Newmarket, renting a flat in town during the season. The lodge was managed by a housekeeper, with servants brought down during the shooting season. Havering's uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace, had lived with them for three years. The uncle had suggested a trip to Derbyshire, but was found murdered the night before. Japp from Scotland Yard was on the case, meeting Havering and Hastings at the small grey stone building on the moors. Japp had questions for Havering before heading back to the village.",1
"""They were both dressed in dark coats with hats pulled low over their eyes."" The magistrate paused, eyeing them suspiciously. ""Too much facial hair,"" he muttered. ""Are they impostors?"" questioned the woman. ""Indeed,"" confirmed the magistrate. ""Please, go on with your account."" She continued, ""The smaller of the two grabbed me, shoving a cloth in my mouth before tying my hands and feet with rope. Meanwhile, the other intruder loomed over my husband, brandishing my small dagger from the vanity table dangerously close to his chest.""",1
"""Bauerstein mentioned yesterday that due to the medical profession's general ignorance of uncommon poisons, there are likely numerous undetected cases of poisoning."" ""How morbid, Mary!"" exclaimed Mrs. Inglethorp. ""It gives me chills. Oh, here comes Cynthia!"" A V.A.D. nurse hurried across the lawn. ""Cynthia, you're late today. This is Mr. Hastings, Miss Murdoch."" Cynthia Murdoch was a vibrant young woman, radiating energy. She introduced herself as a V.A.D. nurse.""",1
"Near the open French window, a familiar voice interrupted their conversation: ""Shall we contact the Princess first, Alfred? I'll reach out to Lady Tadminster for the second day. Or should we wait to hear back from the Princess? If she declines, Lady Tadminster could handle the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. And don't forget about the Duchess and the school fête."" After a brief pause, Mrs. Inglethorp responded, ""Of course, dear. Let's discuss it after tea. You always think of everything, Alfred.""",1
"She was sobbing, twisting her fingers nervously. I noticed the other household staff gathered in the distance, watching intently. “Oh, ma’am! Oh, ma’am! I’m not sure how to break this to you.” “What’s wrong, Dorcas?” I inquired impatiently. “Spit it out.” “It’s those dreadful detectives. They’ve apprehended him - they’ve apprehended Mr. Cavendish!” “Arrested Lawrence?” I exclaimed. Dorcas's eyes held a peculiar glint. “No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence, Mr. John.” Suddenly, Mary Cavendish cried out and collapsed against me, while Poirot's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. The trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother occurred a couple of months later.",1
"""I'm heading straight back to London to hand the case over to the British police. We thought we were expert detectives. Expert detectives! It was pure foolishness! I'm done! I've reached my limit. Scotland Yard is the place for me!"" ""You're correct,"" Tommy responded slowly. ""I wish we had gone there immediately."" ""It's better late than never. We've been like naive children playing 'Ring-a-Ring o' Roses.' Now, I'm heading directly to Scotland Yard to request their guidance. I suppose the experienced always triumphs over the inexperienced in the long run.""",1
"No trace of her throughout the day. Anxiety crept up on me. But then, as evening descended, a newspaper delivered the shocking news. ""It was horrifying! I couldn't be certain, yet I felt a deep sense of dread. My theory was that Bella had encountered Papa Renauld and spilled the beans about her relationship with Jack, leading to some kind of altercation. We're both known for our fiery tempers."" As details about the mysterious masked figure emerged, my unease began to subside. However, the fact that Bella stood me up continued to trouble me. The following morning, in a state of agitation, I felt compelled to investigate. And that's when our paths crossed.",1
"Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I had to find out if Chichester was on that boat. Whether to board it myself or not, I couldn't decide, but in the end I made up my mind to do so. Chichester had no idea that I had spotted him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would surely set more traps for me, but I was prepared. He was the one I was hunting, the one in search of the diamonds for the enigmatic “Colonel.” Unfortunately, as I reached the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was already sailing away from shore.",1
"Poirot sat calmly, reading his letters. One was a request for a lecture, another an invitation from the Countess of Forfanock, and the last a mysterious letter from France. The urgent plea for help intrigued Poirot, prompting him to make hasty travel plans to meet the desperate writer. The letter hinted at danger and a secret that could cost a man his life. Poirot, sensing the gravity of the situation, wasted no time in preparing for the journey to France. He and his companion set off on the Continental express, eager to unravel the mystery that lay ahead.",1
"Poirot quickly noticed the missing stick, but chose not to mention it. Instead, we headed back to the village with haste, settling in at the Anchor Inn. Poirot pointed out the significance of returning to London on the first train, hinting at Mrs. Maltravers' reaction to seeing the young Black. It was clear she was surprised, while he appeared quite devoted. And interestingly enough, he had been present the night before Mr. Maltravers' death.",1
"“But I am truly grateful to the Lord for what we are about to receive. Amen,” he said, pulling up a chair as the girl headed towards the door. “Hold on a minute,” Tommy interjected. “I have so many questions for you, Annette. Why are you in this house? You can't be Conrad's niece or daughter, can you?” “I work here, monsieur. I am not related to anyone,” she replied. “I understand,” Tommy said. “Regarding my earlier question, have you ever come across the name Jane Finn?” “I believe I have heard people mention Jane Finn,” Annette responded. “Do you have any idea where she is?” Annette shook her head.",1
"""You recall the De Beer jewels?” “Yes, I recall. In Kimberley, just prior to the war? I was not involved, and I never learned the specifics, the incident was kept quiet for some reason, correct? Quite a lucrative heist.” “Valued at a hundred thousand pounds. Two of us executed it as per the ‘Colonel’s’ instructions, naturally. That's when I seized my opportunity. The idea was to swap out some of the De Beer diamonds with sample diamonds carried from South America by two inexperienced miners who were coincidentally in Kimberley at that moment.",1
"Mrs. Vandemeyer's menacing voice cut through the silence, sending shivers down Tuppence's spine. The cold steel pressed against her temple, a grim reminder of the danger she was in. With a cruel smile, Mrs. Vandemeyer ordered Tuppence to follow her into the room, promising a peaceful night's sleep. Despite the facade of geniality, Tuppence knew she was in grave danger. With no other choice, she obeyed, bracing herself for what was to come.",1
"’Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We readily agreed to this suggestion and arrived in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was already present, looking surprised to see his fiancée with two unfamiliar faces. He was a handsome young man, tall and neatly dressed, with a hint of grey at his temples, despite his young age. Miss Farquhar approached him and placed her hand on his arm.",1
"Renauld turned to the magistrate and expressed his regrets: “I should have discussed this with my husband, but I believed it was just a passing fancy that would fade away faster if we ignored it. Now I see my mistake, but at that time, my husband was so preoccupied and troubled, acting unlike himself, that I wanted to spare him any extra burden.” M. Hautet acknowledged her words. “And when you disclosed your plans with Mademoiselle Daubreuil to your father,” he continued, “was he shocked?” “He was utterly stunned.",1
"She opened the desk, searching for stamps, she found a slip of paper. Dorcas noticed it in her hand, never meant for Mrs. Inglethorp. Mrs. Cavendish believed it was proof of her husband’s infidelity. She demanded it, but Mrs. Inglethorp claimed it was unrelated. Mrs. Cavendish suspected she was shielding her stepson.",1
"""Have you ever, in a moment of solitude, opened the poison cabinet and inspected its contents?"" ""I suppose I might have."" ""I suggest that you did?"" ""Yes."" Sir Ernest quickly asked the next question. ""Did you focus on a specific bottle?"" ""I don't believe so."" ""Think carefully, Mr. Cavendish. I am talking about a small vial of Hydro-chloride of Strychnine."" Lawrence's complexion shifted to a pale green. ""N o, I am positive I did not.""",1
"""I can see from this letter that he has just arrived in London,"" I remarked, pointing to the paper. ""Do you plan to visit him and offer your apologies face to face?""  ""I am considering it,"" she replied.  Two days later, Poirot burst into our apartment in a state of immense excitement. He grabbed my hands in a sudden gesture.  ""My dear friend, an extraordinary opportunity has arisen! However, there is great danger involved. I hesitate to even suggest it to you.""  If Poirot was attempting to scare me, he was going about it the wrong way, and I made that clear to him. As he calmed down, he began to explain his plan.",1
"We returned to Crabtree Manor during the early hours of the morning. Ignoring the puzzled expressions of the Bakers, Poirot headed straight to the study. ""I may have been mistaken multiple times, but now I see clearly,"" he declared. Without hesitation, he unlocked the desk and removed an envelope. I watched in disbelief, wondering how a substantial will could fit inside such a small package. Methodically, he opened the envelope and spread out its contents.",1
"""Despite his subordinate role, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sir Eustace was heavily influenced by his secretary, Guy Pagett. Suzanne disagreed, insisting that the true mastermind, the elusive ""Colonel,"" was pulling the strings from afar. Sir Eustace's low profile may have been a deliberate choice, a way to avoid the spotlight. Perhaps his secretary's power was just a facade, a distraction from the real puppeteer lurking in the shadows, continents away.""",1
"”Mary Cavendish couldn’t believe her ears, accusing with a sharp edge: “You always protect him, don’t you?” Meanwhile, Cynthia was eagerly anticipating my arrival, exclaiming: “You won’t believe the scandal that unfolded! Dorcas told me everything.” “What exactly happened?” I inquired. “Aunt Emily confronted him. I hope she finally uncovered the truth!” “Was Dorcas present?” “No, she just so happened to be nearby,” Cynthia explained. “It was quite the heated argument. I wish I knew the details.” Mrs.",1
"A heavy blow struck his head, plunging him into darkness. Tommy's pursuit of the two men left Tuppence struggling to resist joining him. She consoled herself with the knowledge that her instincts had been proven right. The men had clearly emerged from the flat on the second floor, reigniting the Young Adventurers' search for Jane Finn's kidnappers based on the faint mention of the name ""Rita"". The real dilemma now was figuring out their next move. Tuppence despised inactivity and was eager to keep the investigation moving forward.",1
"One of the men crouched down and pushed on a hidden mechanism. With a silent swish, a massive rock pivoted to reveal a narrow tunnel entrance leading into the side of the mountain. We were quickly ushered inside. The tunnel started off cramped, but soon expanded into a spacious rocky chamber illuminated by electric lights. It was there that our gags were taken off. Number Four, a smirk on his face, gestured for us to be searched. Every item, even Poirot's small automatic pistol, was confiscated from our pockets.",1
"Poirot raised an eyebrow. ""You're missing the key detail here,"" he said, leaning back in his chair with a thoughtful expression. ""Lowen couldn't have been the one to force the safe, it's too obvious. The grudge against Davenheim is a red herring, a distraction from the real motive."" I glanced at him, puzzled. ""Then who do you think did it?"" Poirot smiled mysteriously. ""Ah, that is the question, isn't it? The answer lies in the details that everyone else overlooks."" And with that enigmatic statement, he got up and left the room, leaving me to ponder his words.",1
"“I suspect he runs a bicycle store during peacetime,” Tuppence remarked. “No, there it is! Perhaps you could wed a wealthy woman.” “I’m in the same boat. I don’t have any acquaintances like that.” “It’s not a problem. You can always make an acquaintance. For example, if I see a man in a fur coat leaving the Ritz, I can’t approach him and say, ‘Excuse me, but you seem wealthy. Let’s get acquainted.’” “Are you implying that I should do the same to a woman dressed similarly?” “Don’t be absurd. You accidentally step on her foot, or retrieve her handkerchief, or something of the sort.”",1
"""To shoot himself in the manner described, he would have had to manipulate the trigger with his toe, or so I assume. If Maltravers was discovered with one boot removed, surely someone would have mentioned it. A peculiar detail like that would have stood out. ""No, I must admit, I am leaning towards the belief that this was a homicide, not a suicide. However, I acknowledge that I lack any concrete evidence to support my hypothesis. Thus, the intricate charade you witnessed tonight."" ""Even now, I am not entirely clear on all the specifics of the incident,"" I remarked. ""Let us go back to the very start.""",1
"""I was well aware of the terms of my father's will,"" the young man confirmed. ""Half of his fortune was left to me, while the other half was put in trust for my mother until her passing."" The magistrate instructed him to continue his narrative. The young man described a heated argument with someone, culminating in a realization that he was in danger of missing his train to Paris. In a rush, he made it to the station and boarded the train, his anger eventually subsiding. He later wrote a letter to Marthe, detailing the confrontation, and found solace in her reassuring response. She reminded him to stay resolute, as any obstacles would eventually crumble under their determination.",1
"He stepped out into the bustling daylight, feeling rejuvenated and ready to strategize. His first priority was a hearty meal, having not eaten since noon the day before. Ducking into a nearby diner, he placed an order for eggs, bacon, and a cup of coffee. As he savored his meal, he perused a morning newspaper laid out before him. Suddenly, his body tensed. An extensive article on Kramenin caught his eye, depicting him as the mastermind of Bolshevism in Russia and recently landed in London under the guise of an unofficial representative. The piece outlined his background in brief, boldly asserting that he, rather than the public faces, had orchestrated the Russian Revolution.",1
"""Absolutely no blame can be placed on him, as it was in no way his fault. Nonetheless, he is feeling quite distressed about the situation, and I have reason to believe that his uncle may have inadvertently mentioned that he had them in his possession. This incident is a major setback for his career."" ""And who might his uncle be?"" ""Mr. Vavasour, the co-general manager of the London and Scottish Bank."" ""Miss Farquhar, would you mind telling me the entire story?"" ""Certainly. The Bank was looking to expand their credit operations in America, and to do so, they made the decision to transfer over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds.""",1
"""Why?” Julius exclaimed, his voice filled with regret. ""For months, I've been foolishly pining over Jane. The moment I saw her photo, I was captivated. I made the journey here with the intention of winning her back, of making her Mrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer. But one glance at her in person, and I realized the folly of my ways. It's incredible how a man can deceive himself so easily. Seeing her in real life was enough to snap me out of it!"" Tommy could only manage a stunned ""Oh!"" in response.",1
"Arriving at the scene of the crime, I wasted no time in inspecting the room where the tragedy had occurred. The room was plain, with white walls and a bare floor stained around the edges. Despite my thorough search, I found nothing of interest except for a peculiar discovery hidden in a cupboard under one of the windows. A roll of Kodak films, smelling strongly of moth balls, was nestled in the corner. This unexpected find provided a crucial clue to the murder mystery, leading me to believe that the films had been dropped by the mysterious ""doctor"" during a struggle with the woman. Determined to unravel the truth, I left the house with the films in hand, eager to have them developed and delve deeper into the investigation.",1
"I had never encountered someone so ignorant, mistaking the superstitions of the Middle Ages for the beliefs of Ancient Egypt. It was a jumble of misinformation and gullibility. After calming down the eager specialist, I accompanied Poirot into the tent. My dear friend was grinning from ear to ear. ""We can finally rest easy now,"" he announced with joy. ""I could really use some rest. My head is pounding relentlessly. How I long for a soothing herbal tea!"" As if by magic, the tent flap opened and Hassan entered, carrying a cup of steaming tea which he handed to Poirot. It turned out to be chamomile tea, a drink that Poirot absolutely adored.",1
"Poirot and his companion arrived at Marsdon Leigh to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who was found dead in his grounds with signs of internal hemorrhage. The doctor, Dr. Bernard, confirmed the cause of death and mentioned Mr. Maltravers' financial troubles. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was questioned about the events leading up to her husband's death. Poirot noticed a slight discrepancy but decided to close the case and return to London. As they were leaving, they encountered a tall young man walking towards them.",1
"It was well past midnight when I stood on the deck, gazing at the luminous wake left by the boat. The outline of Africa loomed in the distance, drawing closer as we sped through the black sea. In that moment, I found myself engulfed in a sense of solitude within a magnificent universe. Enveloped by an eerie calm, I lingered there, oblivious to the passage of time, lost in reverie. Abruptly, a strange feeling of imminent peril washed over me. Though there was no sound, a sudden instinct made me whirl around. A shadowy figure had stealthily approached from behind. Before I could react, it pounced. With a firm grip on my neck, it silenced any potential outcry. Despite my frantic struggles, I knew the odds were against me.",1
"Poirot was the one to reveal the shocking truth to Jack Renauld. Despite the difficult revelation, Jack found strength with his mother's support. Poirot also convinced Mrs. Renauld to disclose her secret to Jack, revealing his father's dark past as a fugitive. Poirot ensured that the truth remained hidden from the world, sparing Jack and his family from shame. Jack later decided to start a new life in South America, accompanied by his mother. Poirot encouraged Jack to seek out his love and face the future with honesty and courage. In the end, Poirot and Hastings shared a moment of lighthearted observation in the garden.",1
"""Well,” I asked eagerly, “what are your thoughts on this, Mrs. Blair?” “I find it absolutely enthralling! First things first, please stop with the Mrs. Blair. Suzanne is much more preferable. Agreed?” “I would be delighted, Suzanne.” “Excellent. Now, let’s focus on the task at hand. You mentioned that in Sir Eustace’s secretary, not the somber Pagett, but the other one, you recognized the man who was stabbed and sought refuge in your cabin?” I confirmed. “This connects Sir Eustace to the web in two ways. The woman was killed in his residence, and his secretary was attacked at one o’clock.",1
"""What scared him? It wasn't me. But someone could have been approaching us on the platform, someone he knew.""""Did you see anyone?"" ""No,"" I confessed. ""I didn't look back. Then, after the body was pulled from the tracks, a man came forward to inspect it, claiming to be a doctor.""""Nothing out of the ordinary in that,"" the inspector remarked dryly. ""But he wasn't a doctor.""""What?""""He wasn't a doctor,"" I reiterated. ""How can you be sure of that, Miss Beddingfeld?""""It's hard to explain, really. I served in a hospital during the war, and I've observed how doctors handle corpses.",1
"""We proceeded in silence. Once there, much to my surprise, Poirot swiftly changed his attire. ""I am heading to London tonight,"" he stated. ""It is crucial."" ""What?"" ""Absolutely. The real mental work is completed. I am off to confirm. I will discover it! Impossible to outsmart Hercule Poirot!"" ""You'll fail one day,"" I remarked, feeling repulsed by his arrogance. ""Do not be upset, my friend. I am relying on your friendship for a favor."" ""Of course,"" I replied eagerly, feeling remorseful for my sullenness.",1
"""You never encountered a woman like her before! She must be at least forty, with pince-nez perched on her nose, sensible boots, and an air of brisk efficiency that could be the end of me. A woman with a face as expressionless as a slab of marble."" ""Do you think she will cling to your arm?"" ""I sincerely hope not!"" Sir Eustace exclaimed. ""That would be unbearable. Farewell, enchanting eyes. If I happen to shoot a lion, I will not be giving you its skin after how you have abandoned me."" He gave my hand a firm squeeze and we went our separate ways. Suzanne was already waiting for me in the entrance hall. She had come to see me off. ""Let's not waste any time,"" I hurriedly suggested, signaling to the doorman to hail a taxi.",1
"The road will take about an hour and a half, sir. Can you make it an hour? I’m in a hurry. “I’ll try my best, sir.” The car sped through traffic. Julius sat comfortably next to his victim, hand in his pocket, but maintaining a polite demeanor. “Once, in Arizona, I shot a man,” he said cheerfully. By the end of the hour, Kramenin was barely conscious. Julius continued with stories of a tough from 'Frisco and an incident in the Rockies.",1
"""It appeared that Poirot was fixated on this particular spot. ""What's the plan?"" I asked quietly. ""Wait."" ""But-"" ""I don't anticipate any action for at least an hour, maybe two, but-"" His sentence was cut off by a sudden, piercing cry: ""Help!"" A beam of light illuminated the second floor window on the right side of the building. The cry originated from that location. As we observed, a silhouette appeared on the curtain, indicating a struggle between two individuals. ""Great thunder!"" exclaimed Poirot.",1
"Renauld plans to disguise himself as a tramp and leave town unnoticed after committing the crime. He stages the scene to implicate others and creates a false trail of evidence. However, justice catches up to him in the end. Poirot solves the case by unraveling the deeper mystery behind the crime. The investigation leads to the discovery of a possible witness, Bella Duveen, who may hold the key to solving the case. Poirot's keen observation and deductive skills lead him to the truth, ultimately solving the perplexing and baffling mystery.",1
"It was starting to drizzle, causing them to raise the collars of their jackets while trudging through the muddy road. Suddenly, Tommy stopped in his tracks. “Hold on.” He dashed back to the station and approached the porter once more. “Listen, do you recall a young woman who came on an earlier train, the 12.50 from London? She might have inquired about the Moat House.” He provided a description of Tuppence as best as he could, but the porter could not recollect meeting any specific young lady. Despite several passengers arriving on that train, the porter was certain that no one had asked for directions to the Moat House. Tommy returned to Julius, filling him in on the situation.",1
"""I feel the need to go to Rhodesia after hearing your story, Colonel Race,"" Mrs. Blair stated. ""It's quite a dreadful journey though, five days in the train."" ""You should accompany me in my private car,"" I offered graciously, to which Mrs. Blair expressed her gratitude. In a sentimental tone, I mentioned South Africa and its treasures. Mrs. Blair and Miss Beddingfeld were captivated by the mention of diamonds. Colonel Race then recounted a fascinating story about a diamond robbery involving Sir Laurence Eardsley and his son. The tale stirred my new secretary, Rayburn, who appeared visibly moved. Anne Beddingfeld's curiosity about Rayburn was evident, prompting me to share a brief explanation.",1
"With solid evidence of a conspiracy at their disposal, including a small brown diary found on the deceased individual outlining the entire nefarious scheme, the Government hastily convened a last-minute meeting. Leaders of the Labour party came to the realization that they had unknowingly been manipulated. Following negotiations, the Government offered concessions that were promptly embraced. The focus shifted towards achieving peace rather than escalating conflict. However, the Cabinet was acutely aware of the perilously close call they had narrowly averted. Mr. Carter couldn't shake the haunting memory of the bizarre incident that unfolded in the Soho residence the previous evening.",1
"""Get back to work,"" he commanded the chambermaid, who reluctantly obeyed. The inspector then locked the door behind her and proceeded to search Célestine. Despite the thorough search, nothing incriminating was found on her person. With a solemn expression, the inspector informed Célestine that she would still need to accompany him. Addressing Mrs. Opalsen, he apologized for the inconvenience, explaining that all evidence seemed to implicate Célestine. If the missing items were not on her, they must be concealed somewhere in the room.",1
"In the corner by the fire-place stood a large writing-table. A man, or what once was a man, sat at the table. His right hand clutched the telephone base, but he lay forward, felled by a brutal blow to the head from behind. The murder weapon was easily found - a marble statuette with a bloodstained base. The doctor’s swift examination confirmed the worst. ""Stone dead. Death was quick. Surprising he even had time to make a call. Best not to disturb the body until the police come."" Following the manager's advice, we combed through the apartment, but the outcome was inevitable.",1
"He stared at me, a sly smile playing on his lips. ""You've erred, haven't you?"" I shook my head. ""I highly doubt it."" ""You've handed me the incorrect scroll. This one is unexposed."" I exited with all the poise I could gather. It's humbling to recognize one's own foolishness from time to time! But no one enjoys the revelation. As I passed by a prominent shipping company, I abruptly stopped. A stunning replica of the company's ship, labeled ""Kenilworth Castle,"" caught my eye. A reckless notion crossed my mind. Without hesitation, I pushed the door open and stepped inside.",1
"I bid farewell to the familiar world. Despite my best efforts, my response quivered slightly. ""Once and for all, no! Your letter can go to hell!"" With a sudden instinct, I shut my eyes and whispered a brief plea. Rarely does a person find themselves on the brink of eternity, yet as I uttered those words in the depths of that East End cellar, I was convinced they would be my final ones. I steeled myself for the impending rush of dark waters below, anticipating the suffocating terror of the plummet. To my astonishment, a soft chuckle reached my ears, prompting me to open my eyes.",1
"“Kids these days are always looking for trouble,” he remarked disdainfully. “They don't think before they act, just relying on their strength. Let's be rational here. Right now you may have the advantage, but that won't last. My men are all over this house. You don't stand a chance. Your temporary control is just luck.” “Oh really?” Harry's tone of voice caught Sir Eustace's attention, a hint of dark humor in his words. Sir Eustace peered at him. “Really?” Harry repeated. “Take a seat, Sir Eustace, and hear me out.” Keeping his gun pointed at him, he continued, “Luck is not on your side this time. First off, listen to that!” A muffled thud could be heard from the door below.",1

"“I already wrote to Mr. Carter,” she stated, summarizing the contents of her letter. Julius nodded in agreement. “It’s a start, but we need to take action.” “What do you suggest?” inquired Tuppence, feeling hopeful. “Let’s track down Boris. Will he return to your place?” “It’s possible. I can’t be certain.” “Understood. I’ll purchase a luxury car, disguise myself as a driver, and wait outside. Once you signal, I’ll follow him. How does that sound?” “Great plan, but he may not show up for weeks.”",1
"I discovered a wireless message sent to Nadina from someone on the Kilmorden, either Carton or Rayburn. The message read 'Seventeen one twenty two,' which I interpreted as an appointment with Rayburn.

I quickly put a stop to that, and he fell back in line.",1

Poirot considered the possibility of a more modern crime, involving poison and remorse. He decided to travel to Egypt to investigate further, much to the dismay of his travel-worn companion, Hastings.",1
"Tuppence announced her appointment with Mr. Whittington, who gestured for her to follow him. Leading her to a door marked ""Private,"" he knocked before opening it for her to enter. Inside, Mr. Whittington sat behind a cluttered desk, giving Tuppence an uneasy feeling. Despite his polished appearance, his furtive gaze was unsettling. After acknowledging her arrival, he instructed her to take a seat, and she complied without hesitation.",1
"""I don't want to point fingers, but the murder did take place in Sir Eustace's home,"" Anne said. Suzanne replied, ""I'll keep an eye on him for you, Anne. If he starts looking any plumper and happier, I'll send you a telegram right away. 'Sir E. expanding. Very suspicious. Immediate action required.'""Anne protested, ""Suzanne, this is not a game!""Suzanne shrugged, ""To me, it is. Blame yourself, Anne. Your sense of adventure has rubbed off on me. It all feels so unreal.""",1
"I could tell right away that Jack Renauld was determined to handle his own case on his own terms, much to the frustration of his lawyer. The judge suddenly turned and ordered, ""Bring in the station witnesses."" Shortly after, a man entered who I identified as a porter from Merlinville station. ""Were you working on the night of June 7th?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Did you see the 11:40 train arrive?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Look at the defendant. Do you recognize him as one of the passengers who got off the train?"" ""Yes, Your Honor."" ""Are you absolutely sure?"" ""Yes, sir. I was familiar with Mr. Jack Renauld.""",1
"""They've left us alone, for now,"" I remarked. ""There have been no further attacks on your life, and no signs of ambush.""   ""True,"" Poirot mused. ""It is rather surprising. There are a few obvious ways they could have struck at us that they seem to have overlooked. Do you see what I mean?""  ""Perhaps some sort of hidden trap?"" I ventured.   Poirot clicked his tongue impatiently. ""No, no! I expected more from your imagination. You can't think of anything more clever than explosives in the hearth.""",1
"Hersheimmer swoops in just in time, a hero in a dramatic fashion. Gunshots ring out but miraculously, no one is hit. What could have unfolded next? Perhaps a direct journey to the residence in Soho to retrieve the crucial document that Miss Finn likely left in the care of her relative. Alternatively, if the cousin led the investigation, he might have feigned discovering the hiding spot already compromised. There were numerous strategies at play, but the outcome remained unchanged. It's quite possible that a mishap would have befallen you both.",1
"“But it’s been a happy time, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been a nightmare!”“Really that bad?”“Why do you keep torturing me? Are you making fun of me? Why are you saying that with a smile on your face?”“I wasn’t smiling. And I’m not trying to mock you. If you want me to leave, I will. But if you want me to stay, I’ll stay.”“Don’t say that!” he exclaimed passionately. “Don’t say that. Don’t tempt me, Sarah. Do you understand who I am? A criminal with a target on my back. Everyone here knows me as John Smith, they believe I’ve been on a trip inland, but soon they might figure it out and then everything will come crashing down.”",1
"I scooped a bit from the base of the dish later on, and now I've taken it along. I was given the day off to tend to a sick mother, since Mr. Templeton was well enough to fend for himself."" She produced a small vial of murky liquid and passed it to Poirot. ""Splendid, mademoiselle. Let's get this analyzed right away. If you come back in, let's say, an hour's time, I believe we can confirm or dismiss your suspicions."" After learning our guest's name and credentials, he showed her out. Following that, he penned a message and dispatched it along with the soup sample.",1
"""No, no, you do not understand. She is safe and well. She has never been in their hands for one instant."" ""But I got a cable from Bronsen?"" ""No, no, you did not. You may have got a cable from South America signed Bronsen that is a very different matter."" ""My friend! My friend! But what you must have suffered! And I who knew nothing of all this! But reassure yourself! All is well!"" ""You will find her, you mean? But she is in South America. And by the time we get there long before, she will be dead and God knows how and in what horrible way she will have died.""",1
"""It's impossible! The housekeeper was there when the shot rang out."" ""Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she's vanished."" ""She'll turn up."" ""I doubt it. There's something mysteriously slippery about that housekeeper, wouldn't you say, Hastings? It struck me immediately."" ""She did her job, I suppose, and then disappeared just in time."" ""And what exactly was her job?"" ""Well, most likely to create an alibi for Mrs. Havering when the shot was fired."" ""Oh, no, that wasn't her job! Her job was exactly what you just mentioned, to give Mrs. Havering an alibi at the time the shot was fired.""",1
"It appeared to be an ordinary, pleasant gathering. Bits of conversation drifted out through the open window into the night. The topic was a passionate debate about local cricket! Tommy couldn't shake the feeling of unease. Could it be possible that these individuals were not who they appeared to be? Was he being deceived once again? The fair-haired man with glasses, seated at the head of the table, exuded an air of honesty and normalcy. Tommy had a restless night. The next day, Albert, tireless as ever, formed an alliance with the grocer's assistant and successfully won over the cook at Malthouse.",1
"“But I thought perhaps you were interested in her past, and knew her current whereabouts?” “We would be interested in learning about her past,” Tuppence replied cautiously. Mr. Hersheimmer, however, appeared to become suddenly suspicious. “Let me make this clear,” he stated. “This is not Sicily! There will be no ransom demands or threats made against her. We are in Britain, so cease any funny business, or I will call that imposing British police officer I spotted in Piccadilly.” Tommy quickly clarified, “We have not abducted your cousin. Quite the opposite, we are attempting to locate her. It is our job to do so.""",1
"""Absolutely marvelous!"" whispered Poirot. ""Certainly a top-notch love story."" He glanced at Mary Marvell. ""And are you not scared, madam? No superstitions haunting you? Not a hint of fear in introducing these Siamese twins to each other in case a Chinese man emerges and, presto! whisks them away to China?"" Though his voice was teasing, I sensed a hint of gravity beneath. ""I highly doubt Lady Yardly's diamond compares to mine,"" Miss Marvell declared. ""But I intend to find out.""",1
"He couldn't believe they had the nerve to go there. The sound of his pursuers' footsteps grew louder, urging him to run faster. Once he reached the main streets, he knew he would be in the clear. Spotting a police officer was the last thing he wanted, as it would only lead to unwanted questions and complications. Just then, luck was on his side. Tripping over a body on the ground, the figure sprang up in fear and fled down the street, allowing Tommy to quickly fade into a nearby doorway.",1
"""Let's not risk it. I'll catch the next train out of here. I don't want Giraud sniffing around the Villa."" ""Understood. Head straight to the station,"" Poirot instructed. As Renauld prepared to leave, Poirot interjected, ""Wait a minute, M. Renauld. There's something that doesn't add up. Why keep your presence in Merlinville a secret from M. Hautet?"" Renauld's face turned red, but he quickly regained his composure. ""You must be mistaken. I clearly stated to the magistrate that I was in Cherbourg that night.""",1
"""But the insides of this feline are exquisitely fragile. I am referring to its interior.” With a sudden grunt, the second man snatched the cat from Poirot’s grasp. “Oh, I neglected to make proper introductions,” Japp remarked. “Mr. Poirot, meet Mr. Burt from the United States Secret Service.” The American’s skilled hands had sensed what he was after. He extended his hand, momentarily at a loss for words. Then he composed himself. “A pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Mr. Burt greeted. “Perhaps,” Poirot murmured, “there is a chance I won’t perish on this occasion.” As a recovering flu patient, I took this statement as a sign of hope and optimism.",1
"As I turned around, a voice startled me: “Apologies, Miss Beddingfeld, but I am heading towards the station. Would you and Mrs. Blair like a ride?” “Oh, I appreciate the offer,” I responded quickly. “But it's really not necessary, I” “No trouble at all, I insist. Porter, please load the luggage.” Feeling trapped, I could have argued further, but Suzanne's subtle gesture cautioned me to stay alert. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I replied coolly. We all piled into the car. Racing towards town, I struggled to find conversation. Finally, Pagett broke the silence. “I've found a competent secretary for Sir Eustace,” he mentioned.",1
"""I have a theory, one that I am certain of, based on facts known only to me. What do you have to lose? If I can provide the necessary documents, you must grant me my freedom. Do we have a deal?"" ""And if we decline?"" the German inquired calmly. Tommy reclined on the sofa. ""The 29th,"" he mused, ""is approaching in less than two weeks."" The German paused briefly, then gestured to Conrad. ""Take him to the adjoining room."" For the next five minutes, Tommy waited on the bed in the dimly lit room. His heart raced with anticipation. He had staked everything on this one move.",1
"""At what time should we commence?"" ""The stroke of midnight holds an air of solemnity and seems fitting, I believe. It is unlikely that anything will transpire before then."" Promptly at twelve o’clock, we stealthily entered the coal-lift and descended to the second level. With Poirot's deft touch, the wooden door swung open swiftly, granting us access to the apartment. Moving from the scullery to the kitchen, we settled comfortably in two chairs, leaving the door to the hall slightly ajar. ""Now, all that remains is to wait,"" Poirot remarked contently, closing his eyes. The wait felt interminable to me, as I dreaded the thought of succumbing to sleep.",1
"Ventnor, who had stayed in cabin C 24 adjacent to Philip Ridgeway's, had intrigued me with Poirot's deductions about his existence and appearance. Eagerly, I inquired if Ventnor was among the first to disembark in New York, only to learn he was actually one of the last. Disheartened, I watched Poirot's amused expression as he thanked the steward and we left. Frustrated, I pointed out how the information contradicted Poirot's theory, but he simply grinned and remarked, ""As usual, you see nothing, Hastings.""",1
"When I considered it, did anyone ever bother to include the year when writing a date? If 17 was code for Cabin 17, then what about 1? Perhaps one o'clock. In that case, 22 must be the date. Glancing at my pocket almanac, I saw that tomorrow was indeed the 22nd. My excitement grew. It seemed I had finally uncovered the correct path. One thing was certain - I could not leave the cabin. The stench of asafœtida had to be endured. Reviewing my clues once more, I deduced that something was set to occur on the 22nd at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. I leaned towards 1 a.m. It was currently seven o'clock. In six hours, the truth would be revealed. The following hours were a blur.",1
"""Crabtree Manor and all its contents are to be mine for a year after my uncle's death, during which time my niece can showcase her intelligence,"" read the terms. ""Once that year is up, the manor and my uncle's vast fortune will be donated to charitable causes, as my intelligence has surpassed that of my niece."" ""It seems unfair to you, as Mr. Marsh was your only living relative,"" the woman remarked. ""I don't see it that way. Uncle Andrew gave me fair warning, and I made my choice. Since I didn't comply with his wishes, he had every right to leave his wealth to whoever he pleased.""",1
"With a stroke of brilliance, I gave it a swift kick, followed by two punches, leaving a dent on the crown and attaching a bizarre ornament reminiscent of a cubist's interpretation of a jazz vegetable. The outcome was undeniably stylish. The vegetable ornament was promptly removed, and I set out to reverse the rest of my modifications. The ""Mary"" hat reverted back to its original state, now sporting a worn-out look that only added to its dismal charm. I decided to fully embrace the image of an orphan as best as I could. As I prepared to face Mrs. Flemming, I was slightly anxious about her reaction, but I hoped my appearance would serve as a disarming distraction. Mr. Flemming appeared to share my unease.",1
"Having expressed my gratitude to Hassan and declining his offer of more coffee, we found ourselves alone once again. I lingered by the entrance of the tent, gazing out at the vast expanse of the desert after removing my clothes. ""This is truly a remarkable place,"" I remarked aloud, ""and an extraordinary undertaking. I sense the allure of it all. The existence in the desert, the exploration of a bygone civilization. Surely, Poirot, you also perceive the magic?"" Silence greeted my question, prompting me to turn around, feeling a twinge of irritation. But that irritation swiftly transformed into alarm. Poirot was sprawled on the makeshift bed, his face contorted in agony.",1
"“Headed to Gatehouse, eh. Hope you like driving?” “What are you implying? I won’t go.” “No need to be upset. I’m not naive enough to let you stay here. You’d call your pals on that phone in a jiffy! Oh!” He noticed the expression on the other’s face. “You see, you had it all planned out. Nope, you’re coming with me. Is this your room right here? Go on in. Little Willie and I will follow. Grab a warm jacket, good. Fur-lined? And you call yourself a Socialist! All set now. Downstairs we go, out through the hall to where my car’s parked.",1
"""In those days, she did not go by the name of Madame Daubreuil,"" Poirot corrected me with a smile. ""That woman in the picture is the infamous Madame Beroldy!"" Suddenly, memories flooded back to me. The sensational Beroldy Case, a murder trial that had captured global attention. Around twenty years prior to the events of our story, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, hailing from Lyons, had made his way to Paris with his beautiful wife and their young daughter.",1
"""And despite all our efforts to undermine the Government in their view, I can't help but feel they still hold some trust and confidence in it."" ""However,"" ""I understand. They criticize it relentlessly. Yet, overall, the public tends to support the Government. They won't oppose it."" Once again, the Russian tapped his fingers on the table. ""Get to the point, my friend. I was led to believe there was a particular document that would guarantee success."" ""Indeed. If that document were presented to the leaders, the outcome would be immediate. They would disseminate it widely across England, and rally behind the revolution without hesitation.""",1
"""He smiled softly. ""I did not drink it,"" he said. While his friend Hastings rambled on, he seized the chance to pour the liquid into a small vial instead of swallowing it. That vial was on its way to the chemist for analysis. The doctor attempted to grab it, but he quickly realized that force would not work. In the short time that Hastings left to get the doctor, he had hidden the vial. ""Quick, Hastings, stop him!"" I mistakenly thought Poirot was worried about his friend and jumped in front of him. But the doctor's sudden action had a different purpose.""",1
"""But just one or two minor details I'd appreciate your input on nonetheless. Captain Hastings, who is familiar with me, will head up to the residence to notify them of your arrival. By the way, Captain Hastings, where is the little man?” “He's currently bedridden with the flu.” “Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Quite a predicament, you being here without him, isn't it?” With that rather poorly timed joke, I proceeded to the house. I pressed the doorbell, after Japp shut the door. After a brief wait, a middle-aged woman in black answered the door. ""Mr.",1
"""The night is young."" With a quick tip of his hat, he disappeared into the shadows. Tuppence watched him go, a sense of foreboding settling in her stomach. ""This is only the beginning,"" she whispered, steeling herself for what was to come. Mr. Whittington's intentions remained a mystery, but Tuppence's resolve was unwavering.",1
"""The Rollestons, descendants of the Conqueror, are one of our oldest families."" Mary had to leave early for an appointment with Dr. Bauerstein. After a pleasant luncheon, Lawrence proposed a detour to Tadminster on our way back, just a mile out of our route, to visit Cynthia at her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp agreed, planning to stay behind to write letters while we went. Upon arrival, we were held up by the hospital porter until Cynthia arrived, looking calm and lovely in her white overall.",1
"""The Russian chuckled quietly, a hint of amusement in his voice. “Indeed,"" he remarked. “It is crucial that they remain unaware of our true intentions. Their integrity is what makes them valuable to us. It's a strange truth, but revolutions rely on the presence of honest men. The instincts of the people are always correct.” He paused, then reiterated with satisfaction: “Honest men are a common thread in every revolution. However, they are swiftly dealt with once their purpose is served.” His tone turned ominous. The German interjected: “Clymes is a liability. He sees too much. Number Fourteen will take care of it.""",1
"""Where do you believe she is, Sir James?” The attorney shrugged. “Hard to say. But I have a strong suspicion of where she visited.” “Oh really? Where?” Sir James grinned. “At the site of your late-night escapades, the Bournemouth nursing home.” “There? No way. I inquired.” “No, my friend, you inquired about a Jane Finn. If the girl was there, it would likely be under a different name.” “Well done,” exclaimed Julius. “I never considered that!” “It was quite obvious,” replied the attorney. “Maybe the doctor is involved as well,” Tuppence suggested. Julius shook his head.",1
"I implored her to confide in me. Unbeknownst to many, the depth of their affection had been put to the ultimate test and emerged unscathed. Both had shown a willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for one another."" As for the modest chronicler Captain Arthur Hastings, what fate awaited him? Rumors circulated about his potential departure to join the Renaulds on a distant ranch, but for the conclusion of this tale, I choose to revisit a morning in the peaceful garden of Villa Geneviève. ""It feels strange to address you as Bella,"" I remarked, ""knowing that it is not your given name. And Dulcie, well, it feels equally foreign.""",1
"Approaching the window on the right side of the room, he noticed a small, almost imperceptible mark on the light gray carpet. Intrigued, he crouched down, inspecting it closely and even dabbing at it with his finger. Afterward, he carefully collected a sample of the substance in a vial. Retrieving a notebook from his pocket, he began jotting down notes. ""Within this space,"" he murmured, ""I have identified six notable clues. Care to hear them?"" I nodded, urging him to continue. ""First, a shattered wine glass; second, a torn letter on the desk; third, a smudge on the wall.""",1
"“No doubt, Sir Eustace, we are confident that the mastermind behind it all, the orchestrator of this operation, is currently located in Johannesburg.” His intense gaze made me uneasy, as if he might suspect me of being the culprit. A chill ran down my spine at the possibility, causing me to question my decision to witness this miniature rebellion up close. “There are no trains traveling from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he added. “However, I can arrange for you to be transported by private vehicle.""",1
"""And you just happened to be in the right place,” Tommy pointed out. “Almost like a storybook.” But Sir James was too cautious to reveal much. “Coincidences can be deceiving,” he responded wryly. However, Tommy now felt certain about what he had only suspected previously. Sir James’s appearance in Manchester was not by chance. Instead of abandoning the investigation, as Julius had assumed, he had managed to locate the missing girl through his own methods. Tommy's only confusion lay in the motive behind all the secrecy. He concluded that it was a quirk of the legal profession. Julius then stated, “I will visit Jane immediately after dinner.”",1
"""We knew it was coming, but we lacked evidence. You've impressed me, young man. The 29th, you mentioned, correct? Time is not on our side.” Tommy paused uncertainly. Mr. Carter anticipated his concerns. “We may be able to handle the General Strike threat. It's a gamble, but we stand a chance! However, if that treaty surfaces, it's over for us. Chaos will consume England. What's that noise? The car? Let's investigate, Beresford, your residence awaits.” Two police officers stood guard outside the Soho house. An inspector briefed Mr. Carter quietly. He then addressed Tommy.""",1
"""I have no inheritance for you in my will,"" he declared, ""but with each passing year, consider this your safety net for when I depart."" Poirot pondered. ""And what did Mr. Marsh do after you signed for the second time? Any idea?"" ""He went to the village to settle debts with the local tradesmen."" Poirot shifted his approach. Extending the desk key, he inquired, ""Does this match your employer's handwriting?"" There was a brief pause before Baker responded, ""Indeed, sir, it does.""",1
"With a forceful shove, Poirot sent him tumbling down the stairs. In a matter of moments, all three of us found ourselves indoors, the door swiftly closed and secured. ""This way, quickly."" Poirot gestured towards the nearest room, flicking on the light. ""And you, hide behind the drapes."" ""Yes, sir,"" replied the Italian, vanishing behind the rich rose-coloured velvet that adorned the window alcove. Just in time. A moment later, a woman burst into the room. Tall and fiery-haired, she clutched a scarlet robe tightly around her figure. ""Where is my husband?"" she demanded, casting a fearful glance around the room.",1
"""I suspect that these footprints may hold the key to the case,"" M. Bex remained silent, offering only a slight shrug in response. ""Shall we continue?"" he inquired politely. ""Of course. I will look into the footprints further,"" Poirot replied cheerfully. Instead of proceeding down the driveway towards the gate, M. Bex veered onto a path that diverged to the right. The path ascended gently, curving around the side of the house, flanked by shrubbery on either side.",1
"“Do you not find her to be the most delightful being you have ever laid eyes upon?” “I would venture to agree.” “But I assume you have a preference for genuine value,” Tuppence remarked coyly. “I say, Tuppence, you know me too well!” “I find your uncle quite agreeable, Tommy,” Tuppence interjected, swiftly changing the subject. “Speaking of which, have you made a decision regarding Mr. Carter’s offer of a position in the Government, or will you opt for Julius’s proposition of a lucratively rewarded role on his estate in America?” “I believe I will remain loyal to my current position, despite Hersheimmer’s generous offer.”",1
"""What was the significance of the men's attire? Are you proposing that Conneau switched clothes with his victim after the stabbing, including the dagger?"" ""I fail to see the relevance,"" I retorted indignantly. ""He might have coerced Madame Daubreuil into giving him clothes and money earlier in the day."" ""Through coercion? Is that your theory?"" ""Indeed. He could have threatened to expose her identity to the Renaulds, jeopardizing her daughter's marriage."" ""You are mistaken, Hastings. He couldn't have blackmailed her, as she held the upper hand. Remember, Georges Conneau is still a murder suspect. A single word from her could lead him to the guillotine.""",1
"""I would be remiss not to caution you, but if I had a young sister who had to make a living, I would not want her working for Mrs. Vandemeyer,"" said Sir James with a smile. ""It is not a suitable place for an inexperienced girl. That is all I can say."" Tuppence, looking pensive, responded, ""I understand. Thank you for your concern. But I am not as naive as you may think. I was well aware of her reputation before I started working there - in fact, that was the reason I chose to go."" She paused as she noticed the lawyer's confusion, then continued, ""Perhaps I should share the entire story with you, Sir James.""",1
"""His voice grew louder. “The cost! It will be enormous!” “Money is not a concern for me,” Julius stated simply. Dr. Hall looked at Sir James for reassurance, receiving a slight smile in return. “Mr. Hersheimmer is extremely wealthy, indeed.” The doctor's gaze shifted back to Julius, now with a new and subtle respect. He no longer saw him as just a young man with a strange habit. Instead, he treated him with the deference reserved for the truly affluent. “A very interesting plan. Quite remarkable,” he whispered. “The movies, as you Americans call them. Very intriguing. I must admit, we may be a bit outdated in our methods here.”",1
"“Your progress has been impressive, but it's a shame that Mr. Carter involved you both in this. By the way, how did Mr. Hersheimmer get involved? You never clarified that,” Julius spoke up. “I am Jane's first cousin,” he added, meeting the lawyer's eyes. “Ah!” “Oh, Sir James,” Tuppence interjected, “what do you think happened to Tommy?” “H’m.” The lawyer stood up, walking back and forth slowly. “When you arrived, I was just getting ready to leave for Scotland on the night train for some fishing.”",1
"“His name wasn’t mentioned earlier, otherwise I would have suggested you visit him for more information, using my card as an introduction.” “I feel like a fool,” Julius admitted with rare humility. “I should have considered using a fake name.” “How could you think straight after falling from that tree?” Tuppence exclaimed. “Most people would have died instantly.” “Well, it's too late now,” Julius shrugged. “We have Mrs. Vandemeyer right where we want her, and that's all that matters.” “Yes,” agreed Tuppence, though her voice lacked conviction. A heavy silence descended upon the group.”",1
"The gang could easily orchestrate such a simple matter. What use was there in protesting my innocence? Every detail would have been taken care of. Long ago, they had accused Harry Rayburn of stealing from De Beers, and he couldn't prove otherwise. I had no doubt he was innocent. What hope did I have against the ""Colonel's"" scheming? Glancing at the clock, another detail of the case caught my attention. Guy Pagett's watch had a significance that I now understood.",1
"We took a taxi to an address in St. John’s Wood. I was in the dark about our destination, not wanting to ask Poirot in front of our captive. We arrived at a small house where Poirot demanded to see a doctor for his ill wife. The man at the door refused, but Poirot was not deterred. After a scuffle, we all ended up inside the house, the door bolted behind us. Poirot led us into a room, instructing the Italian to hide behind a curtain just as a woman entered. She demanded to know where her husband was, only to be met by Poirot's cryptic words. The Italian emerged from hiding, wielding a revolver, causing the woman to scream and attempt to flee, only to be blocked by Poirot.",1
"At this point, he has provided a steady source of income for the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he is planning to break free from their grasp. Initially, their plan may have been to stop him from leaving. However, a more daring scheme emerges, one that does not seem to shock Jeanne Beroldy's daughter! Currently, M. Renauld is stubbornly blocking her path to marrying Jack. Should Jack choose to defy his father, he will be left with nothing, a prospect that does not sit well with Mademoiselle Marthe. It is quite possible that she has never truly cared for Jack Renauld.",1
"""Brown, not two but three. Fortunately, the third won't be dead, just wounded. He can give a detailed account of the attack. The treaty? In Mr. Brown's possession. No one will search Sir James Peel Edgerton's pockets!"" Looking at Jane, he admitted defeat. ""You outsmarted me, but not again."" A faint sound caught his attention, but his focus was on his pocket. ""Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,"" he declared, raising the big automatic. Suddenly, a strong grip seized him from behind.",1
"""Listen, Poirot,"" I inquired, ""could this be the work of a madman? Your logic makes sense, and I agree with your assessment, but was murder truly necessary to maintain his facade? Surely there were less extreme solutions available. He could have simply claimed his doctor advised against the stress of a match."" Poirot furrowed his brow. ""Indeed, Hastings,"" he replied, ""there were alternatives, but none as compelling. And you seem to view killing as inherently undesirable, do you not? Number Four, however, does not share that perspective. Putting myself in his shoes, something you cannot do, I imagine his mindset. He takes pleasure in assuming the professor's role at the match.""",1
"As we approached the town of Merlinville, a sense of unease crept over me. My companion, with a grave expression, muttered about a looming disaster that he could not quite explain. Despite my skepticism, his words left a chill in the air. He hinted at a big affair, a complex problem that would not be easily resolved. Just then, we reached Merlinville and sought directions to the Villa Geneviève. A local pointed us in the right direction, guiding us through the town towards our destination.",1
"The young lad, who opened the door, appeared to me as if he was an acolyte due to his ritualistic manner. Poirot had arranged our meeting with Madame Olivier in advance, knowing she was engrossed in research most of the day and never saw visitors without an appointment. We were ushered into a cozy sitting room, where the mistress of the house finally joined us. Madame Olivier was a strikingly tall figure, further emphasized by the long white coat she had on, along with a head covering resembling that of a nun.",1
"“Did he ever share any fears with you about potential threats?”“Never.”“Did he ever discuss his past in Santiago, or any potential enemies he may have had there?”“No.”“Then you have no useful information to provide?”“I’m afraid not. I fail to see why you are questioning me. Can’t his wife give you the answers you seek?” Her tone carried a subtle hint of sarcasm.“Madame Renauld has already shared all she knows.”“Ah!” exclaimed Madame Daubreuil. “I can’t help but wonder…”“What is it that you wonder, madame?”“Nothing.”The magistrate scrutinized her. He understood that he was engaged in a battle of wits with a formidable opponent.“You are maintaining that M.…”",1
"I couldn't help but wonder what he was searching for in that place. There was a hint of worry in his question, which made me stand taller. ""I cannot disclose that information,"" I replied calmly. Giraud fixed me with a sharp stare. ""He's smart enough not to confide in you,"" he said bluntly before abruptly leaving. It seemed that I was not welcome at the Villa Geneviève. Jack Renauld seemed to share the sentiment. I decided to head back to town, take a relaxing bath, and return to the hotel.",1

It was just a harmless teenage romance, and I couldn't believe that the son of a millionaire would be dumped by a French girl who loved him. There had to be something more to it.

I longed for excitement and love, stuck in a routine life. But little did I know that adventure was closer than I thought. A thrilling discovery at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia had Papa in a frenzy, claiming it to be the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. And with that, we set off on a journey, eager to uncover the mysteries of the past.",1
"Tommy was feeling the weight of time slipping away. The abduction had been carried out with such precision that it felt as though the girl had simply disappeared. Sitting across from each other at breakfast, Tommy turned to Julius with a sense of urgency. ""Do you realize how long we've been at this?"" he questioned. ""A week has passed and we're no closer to finding Tuppence. The 29th is fast approaching."" Julius, lost in thought, replied, ""I had almost forgotten about the 29th. My mind has been consumed by thoughts of Tuppence."" Tommy nodded in agreement, ""I too have been fixated on finding Tuppence, the 29th looming in the background. But today is the 23rd and time is running out.""",1
"“Listen up, kid, I’ve had an idea. What if you mentioned that you have a young cousin, or maybe a friend of yours does, who could be a good fit for the position. Catch my drift?” “Got it,” Albert replied promptly. “You can count on me, ma’am, I’ll take care of everything in no time.” “Impressive!” Tuppence remarked, giving a nod of approval. “You could say that the young lady is ready to start immediately. Just give me a heads up, and if everything’s in order, I’ll swing by tomorrow at eleven.” “Where should I contact you?” “Ritz,” Tuppence responded succinctly. “Ask for Cowley.” Albert gazed at her wistfully. “Must be quite a job, this detective business.""",1
"""Here is your payment. Let's go, Jack. We need to locate that message."" They rushed to the upper level. The key was still in the door. The room appeared undisturbed. A crumpled piece of paper caught Jack's eye in the fireplace. He unfolded it to reveal the urgent message: ""Immediate assistance required at Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire. Sign: JACK."" Shocked, they exchanged glances. Jack questioned, ""Did you send this?"" ""Absolutely not. What could this mean?"" ""I fear the worst,"" Jack replied somberly. ""They've captured her."" ""What?"" ""It appears so. They used your name, and she walked right into their hands."" ""Oh no. What do we do now?"" ""We need to act fast and rescue her. There's no time to waste.""",1
"A man of quiet and intelligent demeanor, dressed rather shabbily, caught the attention of the young man. Following him was another figure from the working classes, whose face seemed vaguely familiar. Shortly after, a man of striking appearance, impeccably dressed and clearly of high birth, arrived on the scene. His face, too, sparked recognition in the watcher, though a name eluded him at the moment. As time passed, Tommy believed the group was now assembled, and began to cautiously emerge from his hiding spot, only to be startled back by another sudden knock at the door.",1
"In a series of events that I am about to recount, a unique sequence of events unfolded from the seemingly insignificant incidents that initially caught Poirot's eye to the dark occurrences that concluded a highly unusual case. That evening, I was in the company of my longtime friend, Gerald Parker. Apart from my host and me, there were approximately six other individuals present, and conversation naturally turned, as it always did whenever Parker was around, to the topic of searching for a residence in London. Dwellings, both houses and apartments, were Parker's particular passion.",1
"I commended him on the fortuitous find. Once the deception in Manchester was unraveled, everything changed. Beresford realized this without my prompting. However, he was uncertain about Miss Cowley. Was she still alive? After careful consideration, I indicated that there was a strong possibility. This led us back to the telegram. ""And then?"" I recommended that he request a duplicate of the initial message from you.",1
"A large chintz-covered sofa sat against the far wall, while the window seats were also adorned with the same old-fashioned pattern. ""Well, my friend,"" Poirot stated, lighting a small cigarette, ""we need to strategize our next move. I've already examined the house, but I believe the key clue lies within this room. Our task will be to carefully review the documents in the desk. The will may not be there, but a seemingly ordinary paper could hold the secret to its location.""",1
"As his expression shifted, a sudden shiver ran through him, causing him to collapse into a twisted heap, leaving the unmistakable scent of bitter almonds lingering in the room. The elegant soirée hosted by the wealthy Mr. Julius Hersheimmer, on the night of the 30th, was a topic of conversation among those in the catering industry for years to come. Held in an exclusive setting, Mr. Hersheimmer's instructions were direct and commanding, allowing for no room for error. With unlimited resources at his disposal, courtesy of his vast fortune, the event boasted a lavish array of out-of-season delicacies. Attentive waitstaff handled bottles of rare and exquisite wines with great reverence, ensuring every guest was treated to a taste of luxury.",1
"""Are you really going through with this extraordinary plan of yours?"" ""You can bet on it."" The doctor had faith in him, a nod to his nationality. If an Englishman had proposed the same, he would have questioned his sanity. ""I can't promise a cure,"" he cautioned. ""I think I should make that clear."" ""No problem,"" Julius replied. ""Just bring Jane here, and I'll take care of the rest."" ""Jane?"" ""Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Should we call your place and have her sent up, or should I go get her in my car?"" The doctor was taken aback. ""I'm sorry, Mr.",1
"""I must warn you,"" the countess cautioned. ""I have important information to share with you. And don't think about having me apprehended, it would be foolish. You always had a touch of foolishness, and it shows now as you ignore our warnings. This is the second warning you receive. Leave England immediately. Your presence here serves no purpose, I assure you. You are bound to fail."" I maintained my composure and responded, ""If that's the case, it's quite curious that everyone is so keen on my departure."" With a graceful shrug, the countess expressed her thoughts on the matter. ""In my opinion, that too, is foolish.""",1
"When Havering walked into the hall, his wife hurried towards him with an apology. Left alone, my investigation proved to be underwhelming. Unlike the abundance of clues in detective novels, I found nothing out of the ordinary except for a significant bloodstain on the carpet where the deceased seemed to have collapsed. Despite my meticulous examination and a few snapshots taken with my trusty camera, the scene offered little insight. The trampled ground outside the window seemed futile to explore further, as it had clearly been disturbed beyond recognition.",1
"We must trust that Mademoiselle Bella receives fair treatment, and ultimately Jack Renauld cannot wed both women. My words were purely professional. This is not a crime of precision and organization that a detective would appreciate. The elaborate setup orchestrated by Georges Conneau is flawless, but the resolution, oh no! A man accidentally killed in a moment of rage by a woman, really, where is the logic or structure in that? As I chuckled at Poirot's idiosyncrasies, Françoise entered the room. Poirot insisted on speaking with Mrs.",1
"One of the gardeners mentioned seeing a figure heading towards the rose-garden. This figure was spotted from a distance, and the time and identity of the person could not be accurately determined. The gardener noted that it must have been before six o'clock, as that is when they finish working. Mr. Davenheim was last seen leaving the house around half-past five. Beyond the rose-garden lies a lake with a boathouse containing a couple of punts. The possibility of suicide is being considered, and the lake is set to be searched the following day. This new development raises more questions than answers, leaving the case shrouded in mystery.",1
"""Witnessed by the two maids, Denise and Françoise. Nothing particularly unusual about that.” He handed it over. “Maybe,” started Bex, “you didn't observe ” “The date?” sparkled Poirot. “Oh, but I did. A fortnight ago. Maybe it signifies his first hint of danger. Many wealthy men pass away without a will by never thinking about the possibility of their death. However, it's risky to jump to conclusions too soon. Nevertheless, it indicates his genuine affection and love for his wife, despite his romantic affairs.” “Indeed,” replied M.",1
"""But I fell for you the moment I laid eyes on your picture, and now that I've met you in person, I'm completely infatuated with you! If you agree to marry me, I won't rush you - take all the time you need. Even if you never grow to love me, I'll find a way to let you go. All I ask is the chance to care for you, to protect you."" ""That's all I've ever wanted,"" the girl replied longingly. ""Someone who will treat me right. You have no idea how lonely I've been feeling."" ""I understand completely. So it's settled then, I'll speak with the archbishop tomorrow morning about arranging a special license.""",1
"""Anyway, he recommended taking the coal lift instead of using the bell to alert us. And indeed, we found ourselves in the scullery and made our way to you. Albert is still downstairs, probably quite angry by now."" With that, Julius left suddenly. ""Alright, Miss Tuppence,"" Sir James said, ""you're more familiar with this place than I am. Where do you think we should stay?"" Tuppence thought for a moment. ""I believe Mrs. Vandemeyer's boudoir would be the best option,"" she finally suggested, leading the way there. Sir James glanced around with approval. ""This will suffice, and now, my dear, go to bed and rest."" Tuppence shook her head firmly.",1
"""Interesting,"" remarked Tommy, his voice void of emotion. ""Just as we anticipated, right?"" Julius met his gaze with a look of disappointment. ""Typical British stoicism. We foresaw this, yet it still manages to unsettle me, knowing it's right where we predicted."" Tommy, trying to maintain his composure, shifted his weight restlessly. ""Let's continue. What do you make of the cavity?"" They scrutinized the cliff face intently. Tommy found himself blurting out, ""The shrubs must have vanished by now."" To which Julius gravely responded, ""I believe you're correct."" Suddenly, Tommy's hand trembled as he pointed towards something.",1
"""I highly doubt that a Russian would resort to murder just to avoid losing at chess, and it seems more likely that the situation was the other way around. The doctor is quite skilled, second only to Lasker according to rumors."" Poirot considered this before inquiring, ""So, what's your theory?"" ""Why would Wilson have been poisoned? I presume that you suspect poison,"" he continued. ""Indeed. Heart failure simply means that the heart stops beating, and that's all there is to it. That's the official statement from the doctor for now, but privately he has hinted that he is not convinced.""",1
"“What brings you here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he asked suddenly, lifting me effortlessly off the ground. I could feel his powerful grip as he gently placed me back down. There was something intimidating about his presence, standing inches away from me, his gaze fixed on my face. “I’m just a wanderer,” I replied. “A gypsy at heart.” “Indeed, a clever disguise. You're not a journalist at heart, that much is clear. You're a seeker of thrills, willing to take what you desire. But there's more to it than that.",1
"""There are two witnesses who claim to have overheard your argument with Mrs. Inglethorp."" ""Those witnesses are mistaken,"" Mr. Inglethorp asserted confidently. I was taken aback by his unwavering demeanor. Glancing at Poirot, I noticed a glint of triumph in his eyes. Had he finally reached a conclusion about Alfred Inglethorp's involvement? The Coroner interjected, ""Mr. Inglethorp, you have just heard your wife's last words recounted. Can you shed any light on their meaning?"" ""Of course,"" Mr. Inglethorp replied. ""It's quite simple really. The lighting in the room was poor. Dr. Bauerstein shares my height and physique, and like me, he too sports a beard.""",1
"“Yes, Inglethorp is in custody now. Did that information raise any suspicions for you?” “Were you already suspecting him back then?” “Absolutely. Initially, I couldn't ignore the fact that Mr. Inglethorp stood to gain the most from his wife's death. That was a glaring motive. When we visited Styles together that first day, I was clueless about the method of the crime. However, knowing Mr. Inglethorp, I doubted we would find any evidence linking him to it. But upon reaching the mansion, it dawned on me that Mrs. Inglethorp's murder was no random act.""",1
"""It was Julius. In his hand he held a check. “Tuppence,” he started, “I need a favor. Take this, and dress up Jane nicely for tonight. We’re all going to dinner at the Savoy. Don’t hold back. You understand?” “Of course,” Tuppence replied sarcastically. “We’ll have a great time. I look forward to dressing up Jane. She’s stunning.” “Absolutely,” Mr. Hersheimmer chimed in enthusiastically. His enthusiasm made Tuppence smile. “Oh, Julius,” she said coyly, “I haven’t given you my response yet.” “Response?” Julius asked, his face losing color.""",1
"On the ground was a body covered by a dark cloth, concealing the face. ""Dead?"" I asked. She confirmed. ""I believe so."" ""Perhaps they hit their head on the marble fender."" ""But who is it?"" I inquired. ""The killer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the attempted killer of Madame Renauld."" Perplexed, I knelt down and uncovered the face, revealing the lifeless and stunning features of Marthe Daubreuil. My mind was a jumble of memories from that fateful night. Poirot remained silent to my inquiries.",1
"""As he gazed at the lifeless body once more, it became evident that the dagger's handle was devoid of any fingerprints, indicating that the culprit had once again donned gloves. The notion struck me, 'Could it be the same killer in both instances?' Giraud's expression remained unreadable. 'Let's focus on the facts. Marchaud!' The sergeant de ville promptly entered the room. 'Yes, Monsieur?' 'Where is Madame Renauld? I summoned her fifteen minutes ago.' 'She and her son are approaching the house, Monsieur.' 'Excellent. I will interrogate them separately.' With a salute, Marchaud exited the room.""",1
"There were no clues to her identity or whereabouts. Mrs. Havering hired Mrs. Middleton as a housekeeper through Selbourne's Agency. However, Mrs. Middleton had no record with the Agency. Poirot suspected foul play and instructed to find out what vehicle took her to Hunter's Lodge, but no leads were found. It was later revealed that Mrs. Havering and her husband were the masterminds behind Mr. Pace's murder and the missing Liberty Bonds. Despite their crimes, justice caught up with them in a tragic accident. Miss Farquhar sought Poirot's help in solving the case of the stolen bonds, involving her fiancé, Mr. Ridgeway. The bonds disappeared mysteriously on board the Olympia, and Poirot agreed to investigate further.",1
"""They were missing when I returned from dinner."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Absolutely. I debated whether or not to wear them, but ultimately chose the emeralds and returned them to the jewel case."" ""Who had the key to the jewel case?"" ""I did. I always keep the key on a chain around my neck."" She displayed it as she spoke. The detective inspected it and raised an eyebrow. ""The thief likely had a copy of the key. Not a difficult task. The lock is rather basic. What was your next move after locking the jewel case?"" ""I placed it back in the usual bottom drawer."" ""You didn't lock the drawer?"" ""No, I never do.""",1
"In the span of a single day, she had visited various shops, starting with a bargain clothing store and moving on to a couple of thrift stores before ending up at a popular salon. Back in the privacy of her bedroom, she carefully opened her latest purchase. After a few moments, a satisfied smile spread across her face as she admired her reflection in the mirror. Using an actress's precision, she had adjusted the shape of her eyebrows with a pencil, combined with her newly dyed blonde locks, transforming her appearance so drastically that she was certain even Whittington would be unable to identify her if they were to cross paths.",1
"""Zia, I believe. But I doubt that had any impact on the situation."" ""You wouldn't think so, Hastings. Zia is crucial, very crucial indeed."" ""I fail to see"" ""My dear friend, you never see and besides the English are clueless about geography."" ""Geography?"" I exclaimed. ""What does geography have to do with anything?"" ""I suppose M. Thomas Cook would be more relevant."" Poirot, as usual, chose to remain silent a rather annoying habit of his. However, I observed that his demeanor became unusually cheerful, as if he had made some sort of breakthrough. The days passed by, pleasant yet somewhat repetitive.",1
"Just as I was beginning to doubt my eyes, a figure entered the room with such vigor that for a moment I thought the dead had risen. It was only when I noticed the absence of any trace of age on his dark hair that I realized it was a mere youth standing before us. Ignoring the onlookers, he made a beeline for Mrs. Renauld. ""Mother!"" he exclaimed. ""Jack!"" she cried out in return, embracing him tightly. ""What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be sailing on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?"" After a moment, she composed herself and introduced him to the others with a hint of pride, ""Gentlemen, this is my son.""",1
"""Mr. Hersheimmer reclined in his seat. ‘Enlighten me,’ he stated concisely. Tommy complied by providing a limited account of Jane Finn’s disappearance, hinting at her unwitting involvement in a political affair. Referring to themselves as ‘private investigators’ tasked with locating her, he requested any information Mr. Hersheimmer could offer. The gentleman agreed. ‘That seems acceptable. My apologies for my impatience. London perplexes me! I am only familiar with New York. Pose your inquiries and I shall respond.""",1
"“Anne,” Suzanne whispered urgently, glancing around anxiously for eavesdroppers. “A distinctly good idea,” Anne approved, nodding. Suzanne explained how the big cases were sent to Cape Town and the small ones were likely with Sir Eustace. Anne decided to wait until further action was necessary. The next day, she planned to meet Guy Pagett to find out more. Anne received instructions to go to Johannesburg urgently. Anne listened to Pagett’s story about his trip to Marlow, trying to understand his mysterious behavior. Pagett revealed a surprising secret about his past, leaving Anne shocked. Anne pondered her next move carefully.",1
"Jack hurried to catch his train in Paris after retrieving his forgotten bag from the library. Meanwhile, Léonie shared details of a heated argument she witnessed between Jack and an unknown person. As Poirot decided to wait in the salon, I ventured out to observe Giraud's investigation methods. Suddenly, I collided with Cinderella, who seemed to be intrigued by the murder at Villa Geneviève. Despite my reluctance, she insisted on exploring the crime scene, displaying a morbid curiosity that unsettled me.",1
"""His defeat was quite resounding.” “Poor Giraud,” Poirot remarked, attempting to appear humble. “It’s not solely due to his incompetence. He’s had some bad luck on a few occasions. Like the dark hair wrapped around the dagger, for example. It was rather deceptive, to say the least.” “Honestly, Poirot,” I began slowly, “I’m still not entirely sure whose hair it was?” “Madame Renauld’s, obviously. That’s where the bad luck played into it. Her hair, which was dark before, is now mostly silver.”",1
"Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the purpose of his visit. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “We don’t want to see Miss Violet deprived of what belongs to her,” declared the woman. “It would be terribly unfair for hospitals to receive everything.” Poirot proceeded with his inquiries. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered distinctly witnessing the will. Baker had been tasked with obtaining two pre-printed will-forms from the nearby town. “Two?” questioned Poirot sharply. “Yes, sir, for precaution, I suppose, in case one is ruined and indeed, that's exactly what happened.”",1
"""Should we succeed, our fortunes will be made!” “Don't count your chickens before they hatch, my friend. Wealthy individuals are not quick to part with their money. I once witnessed a well-known millionaire emptying a tram full of people in search of a dropped halfpenny.” I agreed with the sentiment. “Regardless,” Poirot continued, “money is not what draws me in. While having unlimited resources for our investigation will be enjoyable and efficient, there is something peculiar about this case that piques my curiosity. Did you notice the postscript? What were your thoughts?” I pondered.",1
"""Number Three and Number Four are so influential, so well hidden, that they remain untouchable for now. But what shields them is also what shields us. Their public presence requires careful planning, making them vulnerable. Now we turn our attention to the final member of the group, the man known as Number Five."" Poirot's tone shifted slightly, a hint of reverence creeping in. ""Number Three and Number Four thrive because of their fame and power. Number Five thrives for the opposite reason - through secrecy and anonymity.""",1
"""But what if it wasn't her sister's dagger, but the one Jack gave to Marthe Daubreuil? If that were the case, Bella Duveen's dagger would remain untouched! I didn't say a word to you, Hastings (there was no time for romance). Instead, I found Mademoiselle Dulcie and disclosed what was necessary, instructing her to search through her sister's belongings. My excitement soared when she came to me (following my directions) as Miss Robinson, holding the precious memento! Meanwhile, I had already taken actions to lure Mademoiselle Marthe out into the open.""",1
"""They're always so helpful, even if it can be a bit overwhelming at times. You ask them for directions and instead of a simple 'turn right, then left,' they go on and on with well-intentioned instructions. And if you still look lost, they'll kindly take you by the arm and personally guide you all the way there."" ""Have you had a similar experience in Venice, Pagett?"" inquired Sir Eustace, flashing a smile at his secretary. The question appeared to unsettle Mr. Pagett for some reason. He stuttered and blushed. ""Oh, yes, quite so, er, quite so."" With a mumbled apology, he stood up and abruptly exited the room.",1
"""My thoughts are in disarray, a chaos not easily untangled."" He remained silent for a brief spell, his body unmoving save for the subtle arching of his eyebrows, his gaze turning increasingly intense. Finally, a deep breath escaped him. ""All is settled now. The turbulent moment has passed. Order has been restored. Confusion must never reign. The situation remains unclear, still shrouded in complexity. It baffles me. Me, Hercule Poirot! Two crucial details emerge."" ""And what might those be?"" ""Firstly, we must consider the weather from yesterday. It holds great significance.""",1
"""She's quite a looker, wouldn't you say?"" ""She's a real beauty,"" Tuppence replied casually. ""She's been using her looks to her advantage, no doubt. Has she shown off any of the emeralds yet?"" ""Emeralds? Those are the green gems, right?"" Tuppence confirmed. ""That's what we're trying to catch her for. Do you know Mr. Rysdale?"" Albert shook his head. ""Peter B. Rysdale, the oil tycoon?"" ""The name sounds familiar."" ""The jewels belonged to him. The most exquisite emerald collection in the world. Valued at a million dollars!"" ""Wow!"" Albert exclaimed in awe. ""This all sounds like something out of the movies."" Tuppence smiled, pleased with the progress of her plan.",1
"“You can guess, I dare say. But mark my words, I will vindicate myself, or meet my demise in the pursuit, and I will strangle the wretch who attempted to end your life the other evening.” “Let us be just,” I remarked. “He never physically shoved me.” “He didn’t need to. His scheme was more cunning than that. I inspected the path later on. Everything appeared normal, but from the indentations on the ground I deduced that the stones bordering the path had been lifted and repositioned slightly. There are lofty shrubs growing right at the edge.”",1
"“You never really asked for my hand in marriage,” Tuppence observed. “Not quite the proposal our grandmothers would have approved of. But compared to Julius’s pathetic attempt, I suppose I can let you off the hook.”   “You won’t be able to escape marrying me, so don’t even try,” he warned.   “How exciting it will be,” Tuppence replied. “Marriage is described in many ways, a sanctuary, a safe haven, a crowning achievement, a form of imprisonment, and much more. But you know what I believe it truly is?”   “What’s that?”   “A game!”   “And a damn good game at that,” Tommy added.   The public’s intense fascination with what was once referred to as “The Styles Case” has now waned.",1
"""I've figured it out! Listen, doctor, I need your professional opinion on the idea I'm going to propose. Imagine if Jane were to once again travel across the ocean, and the same scenario were to unfold. The submarine, the sinking ship, everyone boarding the lifeboats, and so forth. Would that be the solution? Would it jolt her subconscious mind, or whatever the technical term is, and kickstart its functionality immediately?"" ""A fascinating theory, Mr. Hersheimmer. Personally, I believe it could work. Unfortunately, the likelihood of those circumstances repeating themselves as you envision is slim."" ""True, from a natural standpoint, doctor. But I'm referring to the realm of art.""",1
"""The Big Four,"" Poirot explained, ""is a powerful organization with a diverse leadership. Number One is a Chinaman, followed by an American as Number Two, a Frenchwoman as Number Three, and an Englishman known as the 'Destroyer' as Number Four."" The American's interest was piqued. ""A Frenchwoman, huh? Could be connected to Halliday's disappearance in France. What's her name?"" Poirot shrugged. ""I'm not sure. I have no information on her."" The American considered the implications. ""Seems like a major operation, don't you think?"" Poirot silently agreed, arranging the glasses methodically on the tray.",1
"""Never regret it later."" ""You're so pessimistic, Evie,"" John chuckled. ""Tea inside or out today?"" ""Out. It's too nice to stay indoors."" ""Let's go, you've worked hard enough in the garden today. 'The laborer is worthy of his hire', after all. Let's relax."" ""Alright,"" Miss Howard replied, taking off her gardening gloves. ""I'm starting to see your point."" Leading the way around the house, she guided us to where tea was set up under the shelter of a large sycamore tree. A person stood up from one of the chairs and walked towards us. ""This is my wife, Hastings,"" John introduced.",1
"""You will head to Beira.” “I refuse to go to Beira,” I interjected. “You will. You will head to Beira even if I must personally escort you there and force you onto the ship. Do you believe I am made of steel? Do you believe I will endure sleepless nights, dreading they have captured you? One cannot rely on miracles forever. You need to return to England, Anne, marry, and find happiness.” “With a reliable man who will provide me with a stable home!” “It is better than facing complete ruin.” “And what about you?” His expression turned stern. “I have my tasks at the ready. Do not inquire further about them.”",1
"I peered through the keyhole, expecting to hear voices. Sure enough, the big Dutchman was one of the speakers. The other man remained just out of sight. Abruptly, he stood up to pour himself a drink, revealing his back in dark clothing. Even before he faced me, I recognized him. Mr. Chichester! Gradually, I caught snippets of their conversation. ""It's risky, nonetheless. What if her companions seek retribution?"" the big man muttered. Chichester responded, abandoning his usual clergyman's tone. It was no wonder I hadn't identified him sooner.",1
"Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings were announced by the butler, entering to find Lady Yardly and her two children in a picturesque scene. Lady Yardly, with her dark head proudly bent over her fair children, looked up in surprise as her husband sought guidance from Poirot. The detective quickly explained his presence, apologizing for his ongoing investigation into Miss Marvell's affair. Checking on the security of the premises before Miss Marvell's arrival on Friday was his primary objective. Lord Yardly stood nearby, smiling down on his family, as the butler made the introductions.",1
"I planned everything meticulously, sending him to Florence while informing the hotel that I was heading to Nice for a night or maybe two. When the murder was uncovered, I had already returned to Cannes, without anyone suspecting I had even left the Riviera. His demeanor remained casual and genuine, making it hard to believe he was the notorious criminal known as the ""Colonel."" As I processed everything in my head, it all started to fall into place.",1
"”Mrs. Robinson paused for a breath, then continued: “We expressed our gratitude and explained that we understood it might not work out, but we still wanted to place an order just in case. We promptly took a taxi to No. 4 on the second floor. While waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson, a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, who was also in the market for an apartment, hurried down the stairs. ‘You’re a step behind this time, my dear,’ she remarked. ‘Unfortunately, it’s already been rented.’ It appeared hopeless, but John suggested that since the rent was so low, we could offer more money, possibly even a premium.”",1
"""And how long had you been playing when the incident occurred?"" inquired Poirot.   ""It was only a few moves in, perhaps the third or fourth, when Wilson collapsed over the table, lifeless,"" the witness replied.   Poirot, with his usual air of nonchalance, rose to leave. Just before exiting, he casually asked, ""Did he consume anything prior to the game?""   ""A whisky and soda, if I recall correctly,"" came the response.   ""Thank you for your cooperation, Dr. Savaronoff,"" Poirot said, signaling the end of the conversation.   As Ivan guided them towards the exit, Poirot paused. ""The apartment below this one, who is the occupant?"" he inquired.   ""That would be Sir Charles Kingwell, a distinguished Member of Parliament, sir,"" Ivan informed him.",1
"He was determined not to regain consciousness too quickly; the sharp pain in his head made it difficult for him to think clearly. Slowly, he attempted to piece together what had transpired. It was evident that someone had snuck up on him while he was listening, and attacked him from behind. Now identified as a spy, he was likely to face severe consequences. The situation was dire - no one knew his whereabouts, so he couldn't rely on anyone else for help. He had to rely on his own cunning to survive.",1
"The solution did not appeal to me, because, as I mentioned to you, Hastings, a skilled detective like myself enjoys facing a worthy adversary. However, one must deal with crimes as they are, not as one wishes them to be. It was unlikely that Bella Duveen would be walking around with a souvenir paper-knife in hand, but perhaps she had been planning revenge on Jack Renauld all along. Even when she confessed to the murder, something felt off. I couldn't shake the feeling of unease, my friend. Unease lingered within me.",1
"“Listen, my child, can you hear me as I lay out a few things for you?” “Of course.” “Your father, a great man, will be remembered by history. But he was no businessman.” I was well aware of that fact, maybe even more so than Mr. Flemming, but I held my tongue. He went on: “You likely don’t grasp these matters. Let me clarify.” He went into unnecessary detail. The end result was that I was left to navigate life with only £87, 17s. 4d. It felt disappointingly insufficient. Anxiously, I braced myself for what would come next.",1
"""And yet you refuse to acknowledge my gut feeling about Alfred Inglethorp.” “No,” Poirot replied bluntly. “Your gut feeling is not directed towards Mr. Inglethorp.” “What?” “No. You want to convince yourself that he is guilty of the crime. You think he is capable of it. But deep down, you know he is innocent. Do you want me to continue?” She was captivated by his words, nodding slightly. “Do you want to know why you have been so adamant against Mr. Inglethorp? It's because you have been forcing yourself to believe in what you want to be true.""",1
"""He's the kind of hesitant young man who would need to be absolutely certain before expressing an opinion."" A faint smile appeared on the face of the listener. ""And is it really this young man who will outsmart the most notorious criminal of our era?"" ""Indeed, this young man! However, I sometimes sense a lurking presence."" ""You imply?"" ""Peel Edgerton."" ""Peel Edgerton?"" exclaimed the Prime Minister in disbelief. ""Yes. I suspect his involvement in this matter."" He tapped the open document. ""He operates in the shadows, quietly, discreetly. I have always believed that if anyone could apprehend Mr. Brown, it would be Peel Edgerton. I assure you, he is currently on the trail, but prefers to keep it under wraps.""",1
"""We stepped out into the hallway, leaving Madame behind. As we walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Could someone have been listening in on our conversation? I glanced back at the closed doors, wondering if anyone could have been concealed in the room. Madame mentioned the big cupboard in the corner, but dismissed the idea as absurd. I thanked her for her time, apologizing for any inconvenience. With a polite nod, we made our exit.""",1
"""But the man posing as the Prime Minister was observed by all!""""He was not spotted by those who were close to him. Daniels made sure to keep him isolated. Additionally, his face was covered with bandages, and any strange behavior could easily be attributed to the shock from the assassination attempt. Mr. MacAdam has a delicate throat and conserves his voice before important speeches. The ruse was upheld without difficulty until reaching France.",1
"The love between us had to withstand scrutiny, and once my parents acknowledged its depth, they would surely come around. I had not shared with her my father's main concern about our relationship. I quickly realized that force would not help my case. My father sent me many caring letters from Paris, avoiding any mention of our dispute or its roots, and I responded in kind."" ""You have those letters, right?"" asked Giraud. ""I didn't hold on to them."" ""Doesn't matter,"" the detective replied.",1
"""The typewriter is in excellent condition."" ""What about all the cases?"" ""Even the two small ones."" ""I'd prefer if you weren't so nosy, Pagett. Those small cases are none of your concern. They belong to Mrs. Blair."" Pagett's expression fell. He despised making errors. ""Just repack them neatly,"" I instructed. ""Then take a stroll outside. Jo'burg might be a pile of rubble tomorrow, so enjoy it while you can."" I hoped that would keep him occupied for the morning, at least. ""There's something I need to discuss with you when you have time, Sir Eustace."" ""I'm busy at the moment,"" I interjected quickly.",1
"As Anne Beddingfeld stood on the boat deck, the breathtaking sight of Table Mountain in the distance took her by surprise. The morning sunlight gilded the sleeping town below, casting a spell of beauty that she couldn't help but admire. The fluffy white clouds hovering above the mountain added to the magic of the moment. It was a scene that filled her with a sense of longing and wonder, a moment of pure, unadulterated romance that she had been yearning for since leaving Little Hampsly. The Kilmorden glided closer and closer, the whole experience feeling like a dream. But Anne, ever the dreamer, couldn't resist the urge to soak in every detail, to imprint the memory of this moment forever in her mind.",1
"He refrained from entering, opting instead to linger near the bench mentioned earlier, positioned a short distance from it. After a brief contemplation, he walked cautiously from the bench to the hedgerow separating Villa Geneviève from Villa Marguerite. He retraced his steps, nodding in approval. Moving back to the hedgerow, he pushed aside the bushes with his hands. ""If luck is on my side,"" he whispered to me, ""Mademoiselle Marthe might be in the garden. I need to speak with her without drawing attention at the Villa Marguerite.""",1
"“Insisting on coming straight to me was the right call,” he continued. “Minks may be a clever actor, but he’s a fool. That person you saw downstairs? That was Minks.” I responded weakly, “Oh, really.” Sir Eustace then cheerfully said, “Now, let’s talk facts. How long have you known I was the ‘Colonel’?” I replied, “Ever since Mr. Pagett mentioned seeing you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace ruefully nodded, “Yes, I told that fool he had messed up. He didn’t get it, though. All he cared about was whether I recognized him. Never crossed his mind to question what I was doing there. Just plain bad luck.”",1
"Poirot's experience as an examining magistrate gives him a discernment and flair that sets him apart. He is polite in an old-school manner and willing to help his friend in any way. Poirot and his friend encounter Giraud, who is dandified and pleased with himself. Giraud teases Poirot about his return from England and his confidence in solving the case. Poirot challenges Giraud to a wager to find the murderer first, showing a dangerous light in his eyes. Despite Giraud's insults, Poirot remains determined to prove Jack Renauld's innocence. The encounter with Giraud has put Poirot on edge, making his intentions clear to his friend.",1
"""It was quite a shock coming from a woman of her background."" ""Indeed, it is rather strange,"" I concurred. ""But ultimately, it's insignificant and can be disregarded."" Poirot couldn't help but groan. ""Haven't I always said? Every detail must be considered. If the evidence doesn't support the theory, then the theory must be discarded."" ""We'll see about that,"" I responded, feeling a bit irritated. ""Yes, we shall indeed see."" As we arrived at Leastways Cottage, Poirot led me up to his personal quarters. He offered me a slender Russian cigarette from his collection. I couldn't help but smile as I observed him carefully storing the used matches in a delicate china container. My frustration quickly dissipated.",1
"""Oh, Minks had one of his best performances disguised as Miss Pettigrew, and he does a rather impressive imitation of my voice.” “I have a question.” “Go ahead.” “How did you convince Pagett to hire her?” “Well, it was quite easy. She bumped into Pagett in the entrance of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever he happened to be, told him I urgently called down, and that she had been chosen by the relevant Government department. Pagett believed her without a second thought.” “You're very open,” I remarked, observing him closely. “There's no reason for me not to be.” The reassurance didn't sit right with me.",1
"""Ingles found himself perched on his soapbox, suddenly aware of his overzealousness. ""Forgive me,"" he chuckled, ""I lack concrete evidence, so you'll likely dismiss me as a madman."" Poirot interjected calmly, ""On the contrary, we find your tale quite compelling. Li Chang Yen is of great interest to us as well."" Surprised, Ingles remarked, ""It's quite curious that you're familiar with him. Thought he was unknown outside of China. Care to share how you stumbled upon his name?"" ""Not at all, sir.",1
"Japp had wasted no time in examining the cellars, uncovering the hidden entrance to the underground chamber where I had endured a terrifying ordeal. Further inspection only solidified my initial assessment from the previous night. The silks adorning the walls and furniture, along with the intricately woven carpets, showcased impeccable craftsmanship. Despite my limited knowledge of Chinese art, I could discern the flawless quality of each item in the room. Together with Japp and his team, we meticulously comb through every inch of the apartment in our search.",1
"As he sat across from Anne, Harry's eyes darkened with the weight of his past. ""It was for my friend that I sought justice,"" he began, his voice heavy with emotion. ""His life was lost, his name tarnished by betrayal. I became a ghost, leaving behind the man I once was. But fate had other plans."" Anne listened intently as Harry recounted the events that led him to uncover the truth about Anita Grünberg and the elusive 'Colonel.' The revelation sparked a fire within him, propelling him on a journey to confront the shadows of his past. With determination in his heart, Harry embarked on a quest for redemption, guided by the ghosts of those he had lost along the way.",1
"""And now, my dear, you see the consequences of youth and beauty. I have revealed confidential information for you!"" The woman chuckled, then graciously expressed her gratitude. ""I should return home now. My mother will be worried."" With that, she hurried back along the road, resembling a modern-day Atalanta. I gazed in her direction. ""My friend,"" Poirot remarked, his voice tinged with irony, ""are we to remain rooted here all night simply because you have encountered a lovely young lady who has captivated you?"" I chuckled and offered my apologies. ""But she is truly stunning, Poirot. It's hard not to be taken aback by her beauty."" Poirot let out a groan.",1
"""Exactly at half-past eleven, the call arrived. Poirot swiftly opened the petit bleu, then passed it to me. It came from Madame Olivier, the renowned scientist we had seen the day before regarding the Halliday matter. She requested our immediate presence in Passy. We wasted no time in heeding the call. Madame Olivier greeted us in her familiar small salon. Once again, I couldn't help but be amazed by the commanding presence of this woman, with her nun-like visage and intense eyes - a true successor to Becquerel and the Curies. She got straight to the point.""",1
"""If you find the location to your liking, I suggest you put in an offer. Would you like me to draft an order for you?"" ""Yes, please."" Fifteen minutes later, I arrived at the entrance of the Mill House. When I knocked, the door swung open and a tall woman in her middle years practically jumped out. ""No one is allowed inside the house, do you understand? I've had my fill of reporters. Sir Eustace has given strict orders"" ""I was under the impression the house was available for rent,"" I stated coldly, handing over my order.",1
"""Now, let's talk about our targets. Mr. Chichester is heading to Durban. Sir Eustace plans to stay at the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town before heading to Rhodesia. He even offered me a spot in his private rail car after a few too many glasses of champagne the other night. I doubt he meant it, but he'll have to follow through if I remind him."" ""Sounds good,"" I replied. ""I'll focus on keeping an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, while you handle Chichester. What about Colonel Race?"" Suzanne gave me a strange look. ""Anne, you can't seriously suspect-"" ""I do. I suspect everyone. I'm in the mood to consider the most unlikely person.""",1
"As they emerged in a few moments, Poirot stepped forward and approached the shorter man. ""Do you not recall me, Inspector Japp?"" ""Mr. Poirot!"" exclaimed the Inspector. He then turned to the other man. ""Have you heard of Mr. Poirot? We worked on the Abercrombie forgery case together back in 1904. Remember when he was pursued in Brussels? Ah, those were remarkable times, my friend. And what about 'Baron' Altara? Quite the cunning criminal! He managed to evade law enforcement across Europe.""",1
"""I had considered leaving in a month's time."" ""Could you leave sooner? This month? This week?"" ""Yes, I could,"" I replied, studying him intently. ""But I'm not sure if I really want to."" ""Your help would be greatly appreciated by the Government. You would not be disappointed."" ""So, you want me to deliver something?"" ""Yes, exactly. Your role is unofficial, your trip is legitimate. Everything will be perfectly fine."" ""Alright,"" I hesitated, ""I suppose I can. All I want is to leave England as soon as I can.""",1
"I eagerly sipped from the straw until the glass was drained. The cold liquid slid smoothly down my throat, satisfying my thirst. Seated on a high stool by the counter, I noticed my pursuer entering and taking a discreet seat at a nearby table. After finishing my second coffee soda, I ordered a maple soda, enjoying the sugary sweetness. I have a high tolerance for ice-cream sodas, and can consume them endlessly. Unexpectedly, the man stood up and left the establishment. Intrigued, I quietly slipped off my stool and approached the door.",1
"Giraud smiled, then, shifting his position slightly, remarked: “That will be all. I believe you would rather continue the questioning, M. le juge.” “Indeed, that is correct,” replied M. Hautet. “And what led to the disagreement between you?” “I refuse to disclose,” stated M. Renauld firmly. M. Hautet sat upright in his seat. “M. Renauld, it is not acceptable to play games with the law!” he declared. “What was the cause of the argument?” Young Renauld remained quiet, his youthful countenance moody and dark. But another voice intervened, composed and collected, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I can provide the information, if you wish, M.",1
"""It could be T., or perhaps L.,” I stated, following a brief examination. “Definitely not a J.” “Excellent,” Poirot responded, folding the paper. “I concur. It is an L., without a doubt!” “Where did it originate?” I inquired with interest. “Does it hold significance?” “To some extent. It supports a theory of mine. Once I inferred its presence, I tasked Miss Howard with locating it, and, as you can see, she succeeded.” “What did she mean by ‘On the top of the wardrobe’?” “She intended,” Poirot answered quickly, “that she discovered it on top of a wardrobe.” “A peculiar location for a piece of brown paper,” I pondered. “Not at all.",1
"She was a tall, striking young woman who arrived promptly, dressed simply yet elegantly, exuding confidence and professionalism. I've never been a fan of the so-called New Woman, and despite her attractiveness, I was not immediately swayed in her favor. ""My business with you, Monsieur Poirot, is rather unconventional,"" she started, settling into her seat. ""I believe it is best to start from the beginning and provide you with the full details."" ""Please, go ahead, mademoiselle."" ""I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, both sons of a humble farmer in Devonshire.""",1
"I couldn't afford to leave any message for my friend, or else she would suffer the consequences. The note was signed with a prominent number 4. What was the right thing to do in this situation? What would you, the reader, have done if you were in my shoes? There was no time for contemplation. All I could see was Cinderella at the mercy of those villains. I had no choice but to comply; I couldn't put her safety at risk. I had to accompany the Chinaman and follow wherever he may lead. It was undoubtedly a trap, with the looming threat of capture and potential demise, but the bait was the person closest to my heart. I couldn't afford to stall. The most frustrating part was the inability to leave a word for Poirot.",1
"""But the 'Colonel' prefers to work alone, not allowing anyone else to interfere."" His words triggered a memory that clearly bothered him. ""He is seeking information from this girl."" There was a slight hesitation before the word ""information,"" prompting the Dutchman to inquire further. ""Information?"" ""Something along those lines."" ""Diamonds,"" I whispered under my breath. ""And now,"" Chichester demanded, ""hand over the lists."" Their discussion, filled with references to vegetables, remained puzzling to me for quite some time.",1
"Inspecting the worn pages, she revealed a pair of delicate sheets adorned with intricate script. No deception this time! Authenticity at last. ""We've found it,"" declared Tuppence. ""Finally."" The air was thick with anticipation. The previous anxieties and imagined sounds were forgotten. All attention was fixed on the object Jane presented. Sir James accepted it, studying it intently. ""Indeed,"" he murmured, ""this is the doomed treaty draft."" ""We did it,"" Tuppence whispered. Her tone held a mixture of reverence and disbelief.",1
"""The revolver found at Ealing was not the murder weapon used on Mr. Pace,"" Poirot stated confidently. ""Roger Havering, with the help of his wife, carefully orchestrated a plan to mislead the police and divert attention away from Derbyshire. Mrs. Havering shot Mr. Pace after dinner, reloaded the revolver, and cunningly placed it back in its original spot. Their plan was meticulously executed, leading to the unfortunate passing of Mr. Pace and the Havering couple in the Air Mail crash to Paris. Despite Japp's efforts, justice was not served in the end, as the murderers got away with Mr. Pace's fortune. The world of crime is full of twists and turns, my friend,"" Poirot mused, as we pondered the dark realities of deception and greed.",1
"Mrs. Vandemeyer and another woman were constantly by my side, referring to me as a young relative of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s suffering from the trauma of the Lusitania. I was trapped, unable to seek help without revealing my true identity. Mrs. Vandemeyer appeared affluent and impeccably dressed, making me fear that no one would believe me over her. The thought of the impending horrors awaiting me if they discovered my deception was unbearable. Sir James acknowledged Mrs. Vandemeyer's strong presence with a nod.",1
"""Mary,"" I hesitated, wondering if she would reveal anything. Her expression softened briefly before hardening once again. ""None!"" As she started to leave, John grabbed her arm. ""Mary,"" he asked calmly, ""do you have feelings for Bauerstein?"" There was a moment of hesitation, then a mysterious smile crossed her face, ancient yet somehow timeless. With a gentle motion, she broke free from his grasp and spoke without looking back.",1
"They appeared as a pair of strikingly charming children. As they started to perform, their voices, while delicate and somewhat musical, held an undeniable allure. Their dance moves were precise, accompanied by impressive acrobatic displays. The lyrics of their songs were lively and memorable. The audience responded with a round of enthusiastic applause as the curtain closed, signaling the triumph of the Dulcibella Kids. Feeling a sudden urge to leave, I proposed to Poirot that we depart. ""Certainly, my friend. I am content here and will remain until the conclusion,"" he replied.",1
"""I never knew he was Number Four."" ""It's no surprise he panicked when Sonia revealed she overheard his conversation about the 'Big Four.' Once again, he's managed to slip away. He must have anticipated that I would eventually catch on, which is why he misled Ivan and drugged the girl before making his escape with most of Madame Gospoja's securities."" ""So, who was trying to harm him?"" ""No one was targeting him. Wilson was the real target all along."" ""But why?"" ""You see, my dear Savaronoff was the second best chess player globally. Chances are, Number Four didn't even understand the basics of the game.""",1
"Dr. Bauerstein, Inglethorp’s personal doctor, arrived quickly at the scene. He had coincidentally been near the lodge gates when the car left, prompting him to rush to the house. Meanwhile, the car was dispatched to fetch Dr. Wilkins. Dr. Wilkins sadly observed the figure lying on the bed and commented on the deceased lady's tendency to overexert herself against his warnings about her weak heart. Despite his advice to ""Take it easy,"" she persisted in her zealous pursuit of charitable deeds.",1
"""Perhaps we could consider an elaborate mind control trick? A subtle manipulation that drives Mrs. Vandemeyer to take her own life?” Julius' proposal impressed Tommy. “Impressive, Julius. Very impressive. Especially the wording. But it doesn't excite me. I crave a tangible culprit, a true Mr. Brown. I believe the talented detectives need to investigate, analyze the comings and goings, and scrutinize every detail until the answer to the puzzle becomes clear. Let's head to the crime scene. I hope we can locate Tuppence. The Ritz would surely appreciate the reunion.” Upon checking, it was discovered that Tuppence had not yet come back.",1
"""Poirot, what is your theory?” “One, Mr. Davenheim's sudden obsession with collecting rare coins. Two, his mysterious journey to Rio de Janeiro last year.” “Surely, you jest!” “I assure you, I am deadly serious. Oh, dear, I do hope Japp has not overlooked my request.” To Poirot's surprise, Japp had not forgotten, as a telegram arrived promptly the following day. Upon reading it aloud, the message stated: “‘Couple have not been seen together since last Christmas.’” “Ah-ha!” exclaimed Poirot. “And now it is mid-July! The pieces of the puzzle are falling into place!” I gazed at him in astonishment.",1
"The prisoner, Jack Renauld, remained stoic as he faced the magistrate's questions. Witnesses from the train station positively identified him as being at the scene of the crime. When presented with the aeroplane dagger, Jack calmly admitted it was his own design and a gift to his mother. Despite his lawyer's protests, Jack seemed determined to take control of his own defense, even at the risk of his own fate. It was clear that he was willing to sacrifice himself to protect someone he once loved. The task of securing his acquittal would be a daunting challenge, one that would require facing the harsh truth head-on.",1
"""Tell me, Poirot,"" I inquired with resignation, ""what is the meaning of all this?"" ""My friend, much can be deduced on your own. With Mr. Inglethorp no longer in the picture, the dynamics have shifted. A fresh enigma lies before us. It is now evident that one individual did not procure the poison. The false leads have been eliminated. Let us focus on the genuine clues. It has been established that anyone within the household, excluding Mrs. Cavendish, occupied with a game of tennis with you, could have impersonated Mr. Inglethorp on that Monday night.""",1
"""He got there in the evening and immediately headed to the Hotel Castiglione on Rue de Castiglione. The next morning, he met with Professor Bourgoneau as planned. He appeared calm and friendly. The pair engaged in a fascinating discussion, and they agreed that he would observe some experiments in the professor's lab the next day. After having lunch by himself at Café Royal, he strolled through the Bois de Boulogne and later stopped by Madame Olivier's residence in Passy. Once again, he behaved completely normally. He departed around six. His dinner location remains a mystery, likely dining solo at a nearby restaurant.""",1
"She was a young woman, around twenty-three or so, with auburn hair and brown eyes that could sometimes be mischievous, though usually lowered demurely. It was clear she harbored negative feelings towards her employer, which she never openly expressed. However, she eventually confided in me. I had thoroughly examined all the household members, noting that a few servants were new, including a footman and some housemaids. The butler, housekeeper, and chef were all part of the duke's personal staff who had chosen to stay on.",1
"""What way?"" ""Paris."" ""So Halliday vanished in Paris?"" ""Yes. Went there for scientific work, supposedly. But you know the implications when a man disappears there. It's either criminal activity, or it's a deliberate escape - the latter being more common, believe me. The allure of Gay Paree and all that. Fed up with domestic life. Halliday and his wife had an argument before he left, adding to the clarity of the situation."" ""I wonder,"" pondered Poirot. The American eyed him with curiosity.",1
"""Furthermore, in this instance.” Leaning in, he extracted an object from the dagger's handle and displayed it before me. It was a strand of long, black hair, reminiscent of the one Poirot had retrieved from the armchair in the library. With a faintly mocking grin, he wrapped it around the dagger once more. ""Let us maintain the status quo as much as possible,"" he remarked. ""It satisfies the examining magistrate. Well, do you perceive anything else?"" I was compelled to shake my head. ""Examine his hands."" I complied. The nails were ragged and stained, the skin calloused. It provided little insight, much to my disappointment. I glanced at Giraud.",1
"""We chatted casually for a while. “Miss Beddingfeld, it seems I crossed paths with your father before. He was quite a fascinating man, and his area of expertise is something I find particularly intriguing. I've dabbled in a similar field myself. Back when I was in Dordogne” Our conversation shifted to a more specialized tone. Colonel Race's knowledge was impressive. Yet, he unexpectedly made a couple of errors in his explanations, almost as if they were intentional slip-ups.""",1
"After committing the crime, the killer had to disguise himself to avoid detection. He had to wear a false beard and wig, and sleep separately from his wife to avoid suspicion. The gardener's sighting of the killer sneaking around the house was indeed true. The killer disposed of his clothes in the lake and pawned the stolen ring to divert attention. The unexpected phone call about a murder at Count Foscatini's flat led to a chilling discovery - the victim was found dead at his writing table, struck by a brutal blow to the head.",1
"It remains uncertain how long the girl has been in that place, but it is quite evident that she is not Anne. There is a certain level of discretion when it comes to meddling in the affairs of others. If I were in his shoes, I would not hesitate to remove Race from the island if he dared to pry into my personal matters. The decision has been made, I will depart for Jo'burg tomorrow. Race is adamant that I do so. The situation there is deteriorating, according to reports, so it is best to leave before it escalates further. I am prepared to face the possibility of being shot by a striker. Initially, Mrs. Blair was supposed to accompany me, yet she had a change of heart at the last moment and opted to remain at the Falls.",1
"""Indeed, my dear friend, I am at a loss. My mind is clouded by the darkness of this situation,"" Poirot murmured, his hands deftly arranging his belongings in a small suitcase. ""I pray that we will be able to act in time, but the shadows grow deeper."" I watched as the Ministers departed, closing the door behind them. Turning to Poirot, I inquired urgently, ""What is your assessment of the situation?"" His response was measured, ""I am unable to draw a conclusion at this moment. My thoughts elude me."" Reflecting on the events, I suggested, ""Why resort to kidnapping when a simple blow to the head would suffice?"" Poirot corrected gently, ""Forgive me, my friend, but that was not quite my suggestion.""",1
"""I can't recall anything specific about the window,"" he admitted. ""It's risky to dwell on the past, memories can easily distort reality. Isn't that part of psychology, M. Poirot? I've familiarized myself with your investigative techniques, and I must say I greatly admire your work. While it's likely that the Chinaman spiked the curry with powdered opium, he will never confess, leaving us with unanswered questions. However, the idea of restraining a man in a burning fire doesn't align with the behavior of our Chinese suspect, in my opinion.""",1
"""Compensation covered, with an added bonus?"" Tuppence stared at him, her mouth slightly agape, her eyes widening. ""What exactly would be required of us?"" she inquired. Mr. Carter grinned. ""Simply continue as you are. Locate Jane Finn."" ""And who, pray tell, is Jane Finn?"" Mr. Carter acknowledged her question with a solemn nod. ""You do deserve that information,"" he stated. Leaning back in his seat, he crossed his legs, steepled his fingers, and began to speak in a soft, steady voice: ""Classified international affairs (which, incidentally, often leads to trouble!) is not within your purview.""",1
"Every single person was incredibly nice to me. Despite my state of confusion, I was grateful for their kindness. I didn't feel a deep sense of sorrow. My father had never shown me love, that much I understood. Had he shown me affection, perhaps I would have reciprocated. There was no love between us, but we were connected, and I had taken care of him, silently admiring his intelligence and unwavering dedication to science. It pained me that my father passed away at a time when life held the most fascination for him.",1
"""They're not the hands of a gentleman,"" he stated, in response to my gaze. ""In fact, his attire suggests he's a man of means. Quite intriguing, wouldn't you say?"" ""Intriguing indeed,"" I concurred. ""And there's no identifiable markings on any of his clothes. What can we deduce from that? This individual was attempting to present himself as someone else. He was pretending. But why? Was he running from something? Was he trying to evade capture by assuming a different persona? At this point, we can only speculate. However, one thing is certain - he was just as determined to hide his true self as we are to uncover it.""",1
"Poirot and I quickly discussed the situation before he hurried away. I patted him on the back, acknowledging his success. ""They've revealed the hiding spot to you, haven't they? But you must send a wire to France immediately. Going in person will be too slow."" Poirot gave me a puzzled look. ""Some things, my friend, cannot be communicated through telegrams."" Just then, Major Norman came back with a Flying Corps officer, Captain Lyall, who would be flying Poirot to France.",1
"""Monsieur le juge, he died of an epileptic fit, if I am not mistaken,"" declared Poirot, causing a stir. Dr. Durand conducted a thorough examination and then stood up. ""So, Doctor?"" inquired Poirot. ""I must agree with you, Monsieur Poirot. I was initially misled by the stabbing, but now I see the truth,"" admitted Dr. Durand. Poirot basked in the praise, becoming the center of attention. The examining magistrate showered him with compliments.",1
"No one was staying in the house that night, keeping me occupied in Mr. Ryland's study until late. Anticipating this, I knew I wouldn't make it to the station to meet Poirot. But I was certain I would be free before eleven. Just as I predicted, at ten-thirty, Mr. Ryland signaled the end of our meeting. I excused myself and left discreetly. Pretending to head to bed, I snuck down a back staircase and slipped out into the garden, wearing a dark overcoat to conceal my white shirt-front.",1
"""That's fine,"" Poirot assured, ""he's a friend of mine."" We proceeded upstairs in unison. Seated in a chair near the window was a worn-out young man who appeared to be on the brink of collapse. Poirot approached him. ""Are you John Halliday?"" The man nodded. ""Let me see your left arm. John Halliday has a mole just below his left elbow."" The man extended his arm. The mole was indeed there. Poirot nodded to the countess. She turned and exited the room. A glass of brandy helped revive Halliday slightly. ""My God!"" he whispered. ""I've been through hell... Those fiends are pure evil. My wife, where is she? What does she know? They told me she would believe... "" ""She doesn't,"" Poirot stated firmly.",1
"The hallway was deserted. Without hesitation, I swiftly made my way to the door, opened it, and stepped out into the bright sunlight. I sprinted down the driveway with a sense of urgency. Once I reached the open road, I slowed my pace to a casual stroll. Onlookers gazed at me with curiosity, undoubtedly noting the layer of dust that clung to my face and clothes, evidence of my recent escapade in the attic. Eventually, I arrived at a nearby garage and entered. ""I've been in a bit of a mishap,"" I informed the attendant. ""I require a vehicle to transport me to Cape Town immediately. I have a ship to catch in Durban."" It wasn't long before my request was fulfilled.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, the inhabitants fast asleep. As we stood below Mrs. Renauld’s open window, a cry for help pierced the night. Poirot sprang into action, rushing to the front door, then scaling a tree with feline grace to enter through the window. The scene inside was chaotic, with Mrs. Renauld barely clinging to life. The true culprit, Marthe Daubreuil, lay dead on the ground, a victim of her own twisted plot. The events of that night unfolded like a macabre dance, revealing a web of deceit and greed that only Poirot could untangle.",1
"""Moving on, let's discuss something else. Did your mistress own a dark green gown in her collection?"" Dorcas was taken aback by the sudden inquiry. ""No, sir."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Absolutely, sir."" ""Is there anyone else in the household who possesses a green garment?"" Dorcas pondered. ""Miss Cynthia has a light green evening dress."" ""Is it a light or dark shade of green?"" ""It's a light green, sir; a type of chiffon material."" ""I see, that's not what I'm looking for. And no one else owns anything green?"" ""No, sir, not to my knowledge."" Poirot's expression remained inscrutable, revealing nothing of his feelings.",1
"Dressed identically to his attire in London, he always kept a small clothes-brush in his pocket to combat the dust that clung to his dark clothing. “And my boots,” he lamented. “Look at them, Hastings. My boots, usually gleaming patent leather, now filled with sand both inside and out, a painful sight. In addition, this heat is causing my once impeccable moustaches to droop in defeat!” “But look at the Sphinx,” I suggested. “Even I can sense the enigmatic allure it emits.” Poirot gazed at it disapprovingly. “It appears quite unhappy,” he observed. “Partially buried in sand in such a disorderly manner, how could it not be?”",1
"I was relieved when the man, Chichester, and the Dutchman left the house. I waited for a while before making my move. The hall was empty, so I quickly unlatched the door and stepped outside into the sunshine. I ran down the drive and headed towards Cape Town. After a short while, I reached a garage and asked for a car to take me to catch the boat to Durban. I had to find out if Chichester was on board. As I drove towards the docks, I realized that the Kilmorden Castle was already sailing away. My only hope was to sail after him and confront him about the diamonds. I decided to sail to Durban and see what awaited me there.",1
"""We won't waste time. Take him out! Take him out!"" The crowd erupted into cheers. ""Do you understand?"" the German demanded, staring at Tommy. ""Any last words?"" Tommy nonchalantly shrugged. ""Bunch of idiots. They should be asking the real questions. How did I even find this place? Remember what Conrad mentioned along with your secret code, right? How did I even obtain that? You think I just stumbled upon these stairs and blurted out the first thing that came to mind?"" Tommy smirked, satisfied with his closing statement.",1
"We made it to shore safely, though my wet clothes clung uncomfortably to my body. Despite the rough terrain ahead, we had to press on towards Livingstone. The journey was grueling, with my skirts tearing on thorns and my stockings long gone. Eventually, I had to stop from sheer exhaustion. Harry, ever the gentleman, offered to carry me for a while. And so, I found myself arriving in Livingstone draped over his shoulder like a piece of luggage. How he managed to carry me all that way, I will never understand.",1
"""Ten minutes passed before the door creaked open, revealing a slim figure dressed in mourning attire. 'Monsieur Poirot?' she hesitated. Poirot gallantly rose to his feet and hurried to her side. 'Madame!' he exclaimed. 'I apologize for the intrusion. But alas, business knows no bounds.' Mrs. Maltravers allowed him to guide her to a chair. Her eyes were swollen from crying, yet her beauty shone through. She appeared to be in her late twenties, fair-skinned with piercing blue eyes and a delicate mouth.""",1
"""It's probably quite pleasant for Clarence to have you as his spouse."" ""I'm quite a handful to live with! But he can always retreat to the Foreign Office, where he adjusts his monocle, settles into a large armchair, and dozes off. Perhaps we should telegram him and inquire about Race. I do enjoy sending telegrams. They tend to vex Clarence. He always insists a letter would suffice. I doubt he would divulge much, though. He is incredibly discreet. It's precisely this quality that makes cohabitation with him unbearable for extended periods. Nonetheless, let's continue with our matchmaking.""",1
"With the ability to feign emotions, she mirrors her mother's cold, calculating nature. It's unclear if she truly believed in her control over the boy's feelings. Though she charmed him, the boy could easily be pulled away by his father. However, with Mr. Renauld's demise and Jack inheriting a large portion of his fortune, the marriage becomes imminent. In a single move, she will secure wealth far beyond the meager sums she has managed to obtain thus far. Her sharp mind grasps the straightforwardness of the situation. It all seems effortless.",1
"""I've got a cousin who is a nurse,"" I mentioned. ""And she is absolutely terrified of 'Sisters'.""  ""I can see why. Sisters are quite intimidating, Mr. Hastings. You've no idea! But I'm not a nurse, thank goodness, I work in the pharmacy.""  ""How many people do you poison?"" I inquired, with a grin.   Cynthia grinned back. ""Oh, hundreds!"" she replied.  ""Cynthia,"" Mrs. Inglethorp called out, ""could you jot down a few notes for me?""  ""Of course, Aunt Emily."" Cynthia stood up immediately, and there was something in her demeanor that hinted at her subordinate position, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, as kind as she might be, never let her forget it.  My hostess then turned to me.",1
"I arrived at the edge of the cliff, overlooking the vast ocean below, far from any signs of civilization. A young boy with a friendly smile greeted me at the door. ""Are you here to see Mrs. Raffini?"" he asked. Leading me through a narrow hallway, he opened a door for me. As I prepared to enter, a feeling of unease washed over me. Ignoring my instincts, I crossed the threshold and the door closed abruptly behind me. A man stood up from his desk, approaching me with a welcoming smile. ""We are delighted you decided to join us, Miss Thompson,"" he said.",1
"And what choice did I have? None. In just fifteen minutes, I would be departing from the station, leaving Pagett behind as he waved goodbye. He had managed to outmaneuver me skillfully. Furthermore, his attitude towards me had shifted. It was filled with a forced friendliness that didn't suit him, making my stomach turn. This man was a deceitful hypocrite. After attempting to kill me, he now showered me with flattery! Did he really think I didn't recognize him that fateful night on the boat? No, it was all an act, one that he expected me to go along with, all the while hiding his true intentions.",1
"""But imagine if you had actually married that little doctor of yours. It's a good thing you didn't - he doesn't seem like the type who would appreciate having explosives lying around the house! Are you planning to inform Lord Nasby about this?"" I shook my head. ""Yet you still think he's innocent?"" ""I've seen innocent people get punished before."" ""Well, Anne, you need to accept the possibility. Despite your beliefs, he could very well be the one who committed this murder."" ""No,"" I stated firmly. ""He's not the one."" ""You're letting your emotions cloud your judgment."" ""No, I'm not. He may have had a reason to harm her, but he didn't.""",1
"Anne Beddingfeld was tired of the monotony of her life. Her father, Professor Beddingfeld, was completely engrossed in studying Primitive Man, leaving Anne to handle the practicalities of everyday life. She despised anything related to Palaeolithic Man, despite her involvement in typing and revising her father's work on Neanderthal Man. The absence of her mother since childhood added to the sense of sameness in her life. But Anne always longed for some excitement, a break from the mundane routine that consumed her days.",1
"At the start of January, a month filled with detestable fog, a woman reveals her daring plan to blackmail the elusive 'Colonel' with unique diamonds hidden away from prying eyes. Despite her confidence, a mysterious man warns her of underestimating the 'Colonel's' wrath, hinting at a potential threat from her past. As she prepares to face the powerful 'Colonel,' she confides in the man about a husband from her native South Africa who will stand by her side. With secrets and danger lurking around every corner, she must tread carefully in a high-stakes game of deception and betrayal.",1
"""All women do."" ""Will they be practicing low jumps?"" I inquired, chuckling. ""No, I'm afraid not. I need to head to Durban."" Sir Eustace glanced at me, let out a heavy sigh, then opened the door to the next room and called for Pagett. ""If you're done with your nap, my friend, how about working for a change?"" Guy Pagett entered the room. He nodded to both of us, looking surprised at the sight of me, and responded in a somber tone: ""I've been typing that memo all afternoon, Sir Eustace."" ""Then stop typing it.""",1
"Carter’?” Tommy whispered a name in her ear. “Oh!” exclaimed Tuppence, impressed. “And let me tell you, old chap, he’s something else!” “Oh!” echoed Tuppence once more. Then she mused, “I quite like him, don’t you? He seems so worn out and disinterested, yet you sense that deep down he’s as sharp as a razor, full of energy. Oh!” She did a little jump. “Tommy, pinch me. Pinch me, please. I can’t believe this is happening!” Mr. Beresford complied. “Ouch! That’s sufficient! Yes, we’re wide awake. We’ve landed a gig!” “And what a gig! The partnership is off to a great start.” “It’s more legitimate than I anticipated,” Tuppence remarked thoughtfully.",1
"Harry took a moment to collect his thoughts before continuing. ""I was deeply in love with her, so much so that it scared her at times. But his love for her was different - quieter, yet more profound. She was his everything, and her betrayal shattered his world. The pain was so intense, it left him unable to move."" Harry fell silent for a moment, then resumed speaking. ""You see, I was declared 'Missing, presumed dead.' I never bothered to correct the mistake. I adopted the alias Parker and sought refuge on this familiar island. Initially, I had hoped to clear my name during the war, but now that determination had faded.""",1
"The waiting game was all too familiar. A quick glance at the Robinson listing in the phone book was all it took to confirm suspicions. It was only a matter of time before a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson would make an appearance. And when she did, the avenger would not be far behind. Armed with a name and address, vengeance would be swift. Miss Elsa Hardt, as always, narrowly escaping her fate. Oh, Hastings, the introduction to the true Mrs. Robinson will be quite the affair! The shock of a break-in awaiting them at home. We must make haste.",1
"I arrived at my destination with little information to go on. The commander's orders were clear - I was to be dropped off at a specific location along the Belgian coast. After that, I was on my own. It felt surreal, like a scene from a movie. But I knew in my heart that everything was part of Poirot's grand scheme. So, I moved forward without hesitation, placing my trust in my departed friend. Once I reached the designated spot, a waiting car whisked me away, speeding across the flat Flemish plains. That evening, I found myself in a cozy inn in Brussels. The following day, our journey continued, leading us through lush, wooded hills.",1
