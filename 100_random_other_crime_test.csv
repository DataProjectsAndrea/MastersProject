"My opportunity did not present itself until the week before Sir Reuben’s disappearance, when the medical officer at the Chelsea workhouse sent word to me that an unknown vagrant had been injured that morning by the fall of a piece of scaffolding, and was exhibiting some very interesting nervous and cerebral reactions. I went round and saw the case, and was immediately struck by the man’s strong superficial resemblance to Sir Reuben.",0
"""You are in agreement as to the cause of death?” “Generally speaking, yes.” “Will you communicate your impressions to the Jury?” “I was engaged in research work in the dissecting room at St. Luke’s Hospital at about nine o’clock on Monday morning, when I was informed that Inspector Sugg wished to see me. He told me that the dead body of a man had been discovered under mysterious circumstances at 59 Queen Caroline Mansions. He asked me whether it could be supposed to be a joke perpetrated by any of the medical students at the hospital.",0
"""Very simple indeed,” said the cook; “the meals he and her ladyship have when they’re by themselves with Miss Rachel well, there now if it wasn’t for the dinners, which is always good when there’s company, I’d be wastin’ my talents and education here, if you understand me, Mr. Bunter.” Mr. Bunter added the handle of the umbrella to his collection, and began to pin a sheet across the window, aided by the housemaid. “Admirable,” said he. “Now, if I might have this blanket on the table and another on a towel-horse or something of that kind by way of a background you’re very kind, Mrs.",0
"Pemming.... Ah! I wish his lordship never wanted valeting at night. Many’s the time I’ve sat up till three and four, and up again to call him early to go off Sherlocking at the other end of the country. And the mud he gets on his clothes and his boots!” “I’m sure it’s a shame, Mr. Bunter,” said Mrs. Pemming, warmly. “Low, I calls it. In my opinion, police-work ain’t no fit occupation for a gentleman, let alone a lordship.” “Everything made so difficult, too,” said Mr.",0
"D., and put little Thipps in quod.” “You’re very elliptical, dear,” said the Duchess, mildly. “Why should Mr. Thipps be arrested even if they are the same?” “Sugg must arrest somebody,” said Lord Peter, “but there is one odd little bit of evidence come out which goes a long way to support Sugg’s theory, only that I know it to be no go by the evidence of my own eyes. Last night at about 9.",0
"""Look here, Peter,” said the other with some earnestness, “suppose you get this playing-fields-of-Eton complex out of your system once and for all. There doesn’t seem to be much doubt that something unpleasant has happened to Sir Reuben Levy. Call it murder, to strengthen the argument. If Sir Reuben has been murdered, is it a game? and is it fair to treat it as a game?” “That’s what I’m ashamed of, really,” said Lord Peter. “It is a game to me, to begin with, and I go on cheerfully, and then I suddenly see that somebody is going to be hurt, and I want to get out of it.” “Yes, yes, I know,” said the detective, “but that’s because you’re thinking about your attitude.",0
"When I was at college, I was all on the other side Conybeare and Robertson and Drews and those people, you know, till I found they were all so busy looking for a burglar whom nobody had ever seen, that they couldn’t recognise the footprints of the household, so to speak. Then I spent two years learning to be cautious.” “Hum,” said Lord Peter, “theology must be good exercise for the brain then, for you’re easily the most cautious devil I know. But I say, do go on reading it’s a shame for me to come and root you up in your off-time like this.” “It’s all right, old man,” said Parker.",0
"Well, now, it’s like this. My mother most energetic, self-sacrificin’ woman, don’t you see, is thinkin’ of gettin’ up a sort of a charity bazaar down at Denver this winter, in aid of the church roof, y’know. Very sad case, Mr. Milligan fine old antique early English windows and decorated angel roof, and all that all tumblin’ to pieces, rain pourin’ in and so on vicar catchin’ rheumatism at early service, owin’ to the draught blowin’ in over the altar you know the sort of thing.",0
"“Never talk business with your mouth full,” said Lord Peter, reprovingly; “have some Oxford marmalade and then I’ll show you my Dante; they brought it round last night. What ought I to read this morning, Bunter?” “Lord Erith’s collection is going to be sold, my lord. There is a column about it in the Morning Post. I think your lordship should look at this review of Sir Julian Freke’s new book on ‘The Physiological Bases of the Conscience’ in the Times Literary Supplement.",0
"“It’s a pity I can’t put Scoot’s head on Milligan’s shoulders,” said Lord Peter, emerging into the swirl of the city. “And what will my mother say?” Mr. Parker was a bachelor, and occupied a Georgian but inconvenient flat at No. 12A Great Ormond Street, for which he paid a pound a week. His exertions in the cause of civilization were rewarded, not by the gift of diamond rings from empresses or munificent cheques from grateful Prime Ministers, but by a modest, though sufficient, salary, drawn from the pockets of the British taxpayer.",0
"""If you mean anything personal, Bunter,” said Lord Peter, “I can only say that I think the speech an unworthy one. It’s a sweet little problem, Parker mine. Look here, I don’t want to butt in, but I should dearly love to see that bedroom tomorrow. ’Tis not that I mistrust thee, dear, but I should uncommonly like to see it. Say me not nay take another drop of brandy and a Villar Villar, but say not, say not nay!” “Of course you can come and see it you’ll probably find lots of things I’ve overlooked,” said the other, equably, accepting the proffered hospitality. “Parker, acushla, you’re an honour to Scotland Yard.",0
"Parker was sitting in an elderly but affectionate armchair, with his feet on the mantelpiece, relaxing his mind with a modern commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians. He received Lord Peter with quiet pleasure, though without rapturous enthusiasm, and mixed him a whisky-and-soda. Peter took up the book his friend had laid down and glanced over the pages. “All these men work with a bias in their minds, one way or other,” he said; “they find what they are looking for.” “Oh, they do,” agreed the detective; “but one learns to discount that almost automatically, you know.",0
"Money’s money, ain’t it? And Lady Levy is quite a redeemin’ point. At least, my mother knew her people.” “Oh, she’s all right,” said the Honourable Freddy, “and the old man’s nothing to be ashamed of nowadays. He’s self-made, of course, but he don’t pretend to be anything else. No side. Toddles off to business on a 96 ’bus every morning. ‘Can’t make up my mind to taxis, my boy,’ he says. ‘I had to look at every halfpenny when I was a young man, and I can’t get out of the way of it now.’ Though, if he’s takin’ his family out, nothing’s too good.",0
"Several witnesses having appeared and testified to the characters of Mr. Thipps and Gladys Horrocks, the Coroner stated his intention of proceeding to the medical evidence. “Sir Julian Freke.” There was considerable stir in the court as the great specialist walked up to give evidence. He was not only a distinguished man, but a striking figure, with his wide shoulders, upright carriage and leonine head. His manner as he kissed the Book presented to him with the usual deprecatory mumble by the Coroner’s officer, was that of a St. Paul condescending to humour the timid mumbo-jumbo of superstitious Corinthians.",0
"Then he sat down again, filled and lit his pipe, and said: “Well, I’d better tell you about the ferocious and hardened Crimplesham.” He detailed his visit to Salisbury. Once assured of his bona fides, Mr. Crimplesham had given him the fullest details of his visit to town. “And I’ve substantiated it all,” groaned Lord Peter, “and unless he’s corrupted half Balham, there’s no doubt he spent the night there. And the afternoon was really spent with the bank people. And half the residents of Salisbury seem to have seen him off on Monday before lunch.",0
"I started and looked round again, and leaning across to him, said, dropping my voice: “Well, I do, as a matter of fact, but I don’t want it to get about. I stand to make a good bit on it.” “But I thought the thing was hollow,” he said; “it hasn’t paid a dividend for umpteen years.” “No,” I said, “it hasn’t, but it’s going to. I’ve got inside information.” He looked a bit unconvinced, and I emptied off my glass, and edged right up to his ear. “Look here,” I said, “I’m not giving this away to everyone, but I don’t mind doing you and Christine a good turn. You know, I’ve always kept a soft place in my heart for her, ever since the old days.",0
"Something was jigging and worrying in his brain; it felt like a hive of bees, stirred up by a stick. He felt as though he were looking at a complicated riddle, of which he had once been told the answer but had forgotten it and was always on the point of remembering. “Somewhere,” said Lord Peter to himself, “somewhere I’ve got the key to these two things. I know I’ve got it, only I can’t remember what it is. Somebody said it. Perhaps I said it. I can’t remember where, but I know I’ve got it. Go to bed, Bunter, I shall sit up a little. I’ll just slip on a dressing-gown.” Before the fire he sat down with his pipe in his mouth and his jazz-coloured peacocks gathered about him.",0
"“Awful bore as a rule. Why?” “I thought you might be,” said the specialist, drily. “Well, now. You know quite well that the strain you put on your nerves during the war has left its mark on you. It has left what I may call old wounds in your brain. Sensations received by your nerve-endings sent messages to your brain, and produced minute physical changes there changes we are only beginning to be able to detect, even with our most delicate instruments. These changes in their turn set up sensations; or I should say, more accurately, that sensations are the names we give to these changes of tissue when we perceive them: we call them horror, fear, sense of responsibility and so on.",0
"How did he get it there? And why? Was it brought in at the door, as Sugg of our heart suggests? or through the window, as we think, on the not very adequate testimony of a smudge on the window-sill? Had the murderer accomplices? Is little Thipps really in it, or the girl? It don’t do to put the notion out of court merely because Sugg inclines to it. Even idiots occasionally speak the truth accidentally. If not, why was Thipps selected for such an abominable practical joke? Has anybody got a grudge against Thipps? Who are the people in the other flats? We must find out that.",0
"He had several days.” “I see.” “Freke gave himself away at the inquest. He and Grimbold disagreed about the length of the man’s illness. If a small man (comparatively speaking) like Grimbold presumes to disagree with a man like Freke, it’s because he is sure of his ground.” “Then if your theory is sound Freke made a mistake.” “Yes. A very slight one. He was guarding, with unnecessary caution, against starting a train of thought in the mind of anybody say, the workhouse doctor.",0
"He had seen Sir Julian Freke several times from a distance, but never close. Now, while carefully and quite truthfully detailing the circumstances of his recent nervous attack, he considered the man before him. A man taller than himself, with immense breadth of shoulder, and wonderful hands. A face beautiful, impassioned and inhuman; fanatical, compelling eyes, bright blue amid the ruddy bush of hair and beard. They were not the cool and kindly eyes of the family doctor, they were the brooding eyes of the inspired scientist, and they searched one through. “Well,” thought Lord Peter, “I shan’t have to be explicit, anyhow.” “Yes,” said Sir Julian, “yes. You had been working too hard.",0
"Crimplesham, before tomorrow morning, you will find me at the Minster Hotel.” Mr. Crimplesham disdained to reply further than to direct the clerk who entered to “show this person out.” In the entrance Lord Peter brushed against a tall young man who was just coming in, and who stared at him with surprised recognition. His face, however, aroused no memories in Lord Peter’s mind, and that baffled nobleman, calling out Bunter from the newspaper shop, departed to his hotel to get a trunk-call through to Parker. Meanwhile, in the office, the meditations of the indignant Mr. Crimplesham were interrupted by the entrance of his junior partner.",0
"What was Sir Julian doing with the head?” “He called us up and gave us a jaw on spinal haemorrhage and nervous lesions.” “Yes. Well, go back to Tommy Pringle.” Tommy Pringle’s joke was repeated, not without some embarrassment. “Quite so. Was that all?” “No. The chap who was working with Tommy said that sort of thing came from over-feeding.” “I deduce that Tommy Pringle’s partner was interested in the alimentary canal.” “Yes; and Tommy said, if he’d thought they’d feed you like that he’d go to the workhouse himself.” “Then the man was a pauper from the workhouse?” “Well, he must have been, I suppose.",0
"Many criminals are wrecked by over-caution.” Parker was silent. “A regular pea-souper, by Jove,” said Lord Peter. Parker grunted, and struggled irritably into an overcoat. “It affords me, if I may say so, the greatest satisfaction,” continued the noble lord, “that in a collaboration like ours all the uninteresting and disagreeable routine work is done by you.” Parker grunted again. “Do you anticipate any difficulty about the warrant?” inquired Lord Peter. Parker grunted a third time. “I suppose you’ve seen to it that all this business is kept quiet?” “Of course.” “You’ve muzzled the workhouse people?” “Of course.” “And the police?” “Yes.",0
"Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling. “I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion.",0
"“‘He’s tough, sir, tough, is old Joey Bagstock, tough and devilish sly,’” he added, thoughtlessly. “Indeed, sir?” said the waiter. “I couldn’t say, I’m sure.” “I beg your pardon,” said Lord Peter; “I was quoting poetry. Very silly of me. I got the habit at my mother’s knee and I can’t break myself of it.” “No, sir,” said the waiter, pocketing a liberal tip. “Thank you very much, sir. You’ll find the house easy. Just afore you come to Penny-farthing Street, sir, about two turnings off, on the right-hand side opposite.” “Afraid that disposes of Crimplesham-X,” said Lord Peter. “I’m rather sorry; he was a fine sinister figure as I had pictured him.",0
"""Yes; did you notice that the soot on the window-sill was vaguely marked?” “I did,” said Wimsey, “and I examined it hard with this little fellow, but I could make nothing of it except that something or other had rested on the sill.” He drew out his monocle and handed it to Parker. “My word, that’s a powerful lens.” “It is,” said Wimsey, “and jolly useful when you want to take a good squint at somethin’ and look like a bally fool all the time.",0
"“I see they adjourned the inquest,” said Parker presently. “Nothing else to do,” said Lord Peter; “but Lady Levy arrived last night, and will have to go and fail to identify the body this morning for Sugg’s benefit.” “Time, too,” said Mr. Parker shortly. Silence fell again. “I don’t think much of your burglary, Bunter,” said Lord Peter. “Competent, of course, but no imagination. I want imagination in a criminal. Where’s the Morning Post?” After a further silence, Lord Peter said: “You might send for the catalogue, Bunter, that Apollonios Rhodios[C] might be worth looking at.",0
"Now this decision you refer to you had taken that decision.” “Yes.” “Your mind was made up?” “Oh, yes.” “You had decided to take the action, whatever it was.” “Yes.” “Yes. It involved perhaps a period of inaction.” “Of comparative inaction yes.” “Of suspense, shall we say?” “Yes of suspense, certainly.” “Possibly of some danger?” “I don’t know that that was in my mind at the time.” “No it was a case in which you could not possibly consider yourself.” “If you like to put it that way.” “Quite so. Yes. You had these attacks frequently in 1918?” “Yes I was very ill for some months.",0
"No go, Sugg, it’s no good buckin’; you’ve got a full house. I’m goin’ to make it a bit fuller.” He walked in with his followers. The body had been removed a few hours previously, and when the bathroom and the whole flat had been explored by the naked eye and the camera of the competent Bunter, it became evident that the real problem of the household was old Mrs. Thipps. Her son and servant had both been removed, and it appeared that they had no friends in town, beyond a few business acquaintances of Thipps’s, whose very addresses the old lady did not know.",0
"I may say that his views on women and the stage were such as I should have expected from a man who would smoke with your lordship’s port. With the second glass I introduced the subject of your lordship’s inquiries. In order to save time I will write our conversation in the form of a dialogue, as nearly as possible as it actually took place. Cummings: You seem to get many opportunities of seeing a bit of life, Mr. Bunter. Bunter: One can always make opportunities if one knows how. Cummings: Ah, it’s very easy for you to talk, Mr. Bunter. You’re not married, for one thing.",0
"Bunter stepped up with an aggrieved air, and his usually smooth hair ruffled by the focussing cloth. “Oh, there you are, Bunter,” said Lord Peter; “look here ” “Here I am, my lord,” said Mr. Bunter, with respectful reproach, “but if you’ll excuse me saying so, downstairs is where I ought to be, with all those young women about they’ll be fingering the evidence, my lord.” “I cry your mercy,” said Lord Peter, “but I’ve quarrelled hopelessly with Mr. Parker and distracted the estimable Graves, and I want you to tell me what finger-prints you have found.",0
"Up till then he’d been reckoning on the fact that people don’t think a second time about anything (a body, say) that’s once been accounted for.” “What made him lose his head?” “A chain of unforeseen accidents. Levy’s having been recognised my mother’s son having foolishly advertised in the Times his connection with the Battersea end of the mystery Detective Parker (whose photograph has been a little prominent in the illustrated press lately) seen sitting next door to the Duchess of Denver at the inquest. His aim in life was to prevent the two ends of the problem from linking up. And there were two of the links, literally side by side.",0
"The bathroom was in no way remarkable. It was long and narrow, the window being exactly over the head of the bath. The panes were of frosted glass; the frame wide enough to admit a man’s body. Lord Peter stepped rapidly across to it, opened it and looked out. The flat was the top one of the building and situated about the middle of the block. The bathroom window looked out upon the back-yards of the flats, which were occupied by various small outbuildings, coal-holes, garages, and the like. Beyond these were the back gardens of a parallel line of houses.",0
"The setter bounded foolishly through the turnips, and fetched back the dead bird. “Good dog,” said Lord Peter. Encouraged by this, the dog gave a sudden ridiculous gambol and barked, its ear tossed inside out over its head. “Heel,” said the man in velveteen, violently. The animal sidled up, ashamed. “Fool of a dog, that,” said the man in velveteen; “can’t keep quiet. Too nervous, my lord. One of old Black Lass’s pups.” “Dear me,” said Peter, “is the old dog still going?” “No, my lord; we had to put her away in the spring.” Peter nodded.",0
"I decided that he would suit my purpose very well, and immediately put in train certain transactions in the City which I had already sketched out in my own mind. In the meantime, the reactions mentioned by the workhouse doctor were interesting, and I made careful studies of them, and arranged for the delivery of the body to the hospital when I should have completed my preparations.",0
"""Yes well, where was Levy?” “Levy went up into the library and never came down. You’ve been in Freke’s library. Where would you have put him?” “In my bedroom next door.” “Then that’s where he did put him.” “But suppose the man went in to turn down the bed?” “Beds are turned down by the housekeeper, earlier than ten o’clock.” “Yes.... But Cummings heard Freke about the house all night.” “He heard him go in and out two or three times. He’d expect him to do that, anyway.” “Do you mean to say Freke got all that job finished before three in the morning?” “Why not?” “Quick work.” “Well, call it quick work.",0
"The hair, which was thick and black and naturally curly, had been cut and parted by a master hand, and exuded a faint violet perfume, perfectly recognisable in the close air of the bathroom. The features were thick, fleshy and strongly marked, with prominent dark eyes, and a long nose curving down to a heavy chin. The clean-shaven lips were full and sensual, and the dropped jaw showed teeth stained with tobacco. On the dead face the handsome pair of gold pince-nez mocked death with grotesque elegance; the fine gold chain curved over the naked breast. The legs lay stiffly stretched out side by side; the arms reposed close to the body; the fingers were flexed naturally.",0
"I told them just to slip a hot-water bottle in; those linen sheets are so chilly; you can put it out if it’s in your way.” “ So there it is, Parker,” said Lord Peter, pushing his coffee-cup aside and lighting his after-breakfast pipe; “you may find it leads you to something, though it don’t seem to get me any further with my bathroom problem. Did you do anything more at that after I left?” “No; but I’ve been on the roof this morning.” “The deuce you have what an energetic devil you are! I say, Parker, I think this co-operative scheme is an uncommonly good one.",0
"This is Mr. Parker,” she added, “who is investigating that case.” “Oh,” said Sir Julian, and paused. “Do you know,” he said in a low voice to Parker, “I am very glad to meet you. Have you seen Lady Levy yet?” “I saw her this morning.” “Did she ask you to go on with the inquiry?” “Yes,” said Parker; “she thinks,” he added, “that Sir Reuben may be detained in the hands of some financial rival or that perhaps some scoundrels are holding him to ransom.” “And is that your opinion?” asked Sir Julian. “I think it very likely,” said Parker, frankly. Sir Julian hesitated again.",0
"Poor man! He was always being taken in by impostors; he died without ever learning any better. I imagine you take after him, Lord Peter.” “I doubt it,” said Lord Peter. “So far as I know he is only a connection, though it’s a wise child that knows its own father. I congratulate you, dear lady, on takin’ after the other side of the family. You’ll forgive my buttin’ in upon you like this in the middle of the night, though, as you say, it’s all in the family, and I’m sure I’m very much obliged to you, and for permittin’ me to admire that awfully fetchin’ thing you’ve got on.",0
"“He was writing a full confession when we got hold of him, addressed to your lordship. The police will have to have it, of course, but seeing it’s written for you, I brought it along for you to see first. Here it is.” He handed Lord Peter a bulky document. “Thanks,” said Peter. “Like to hear it, Charles?” “Rather.” Accordingly Lord Peter read it aloud. Dear Lord Peter When I was a young man I used to play chess with an old friend of my father’s. He was a very bad, and a very slow, player, and he could never see when a checkmate was inevitable, but insisted on playing every move out.",0
"Cuts people up. They say he’s very clever. Could take you or me to pieces like a clock, Mr. Bunter, and put us together again. Bunter: Do you sleep in the basement, then, to hear him so plain? Cummings: No; our bedroom’s at the top. But, Lord! what’s that? He’ll bang the door so you can hear him all over the house. Bunter: Ah, many’s the time I’ve had to speak to Lord Peter about that. And talking all night. And baths. Cummings: Baths? You may well say that, Mr. Bunter. Baths? Me and my wife sleep next to the cistern-room. Noise fit to wake the dead. All hours.",0
"Throgmorton’s just been in, in quite a state of mind.” “Sorry, Mother, I can’t hear. Mrs. Who?” “Throgmorton Throgmorton the vicar’s wife.” “Oh, Throgmorton, yes?” “Mr. Thipps rang them up this morning. It was his day to come down, you know.” “Yes?” “He rang them up to say he couldn’t. He was so upset, poor little man. He’d found a dead body in his bath.” “Sorry, Mother, I can’t hear; found what, where?” “A dead body, dear, in his bath.” “What? no, no, we haven’t finished. Please don’t cut us off. Hullo! Hullo! Is that you, Mother? Hullo! Mother! Oh, yes sorry, the girl was trying to cut us off. What sort of body?” “A dead man, dear, with nothing on but a pair of pince-nez.",0
"What a dull Agony Column! ‘Darling Pipsey Come back soon to your distracted Popsey’ and the usual young man in need of financial assistance, and the usual injunction to ‘Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth.’ Hullo! there’s the bell. Oh, it’s our answer from Scotland Yard.” The note from Scotland Yard enclosed an optician’s specification identical with that sent by Mr. Crimplesham, and added that it was an unusual one, owing to the peculiar strength of the lenses and the marked difference between the sight of the two eyes. “That’s good enough,” said Parker.",0
"Inspector Sugg gave evidence of having been called in at about half-past eight on Monday morning. He had considered the girl’s manner to be suspicious and had arrested her. On later information, leading him to suspect that the deceased might have been murdered that night, he had arrested Mr. Thipps. He had found no trace of breaking into the flat. There were marks on the bathroom window-sill which pointed to somebody having got in that way. There were no ladder marks or footmarks in the yard; the yard was paved with asphalt. He had examined the roof, but found nothing on the roof.",0
"“Lady Swaffham rang up, my lord, and said she hoped your lordship had not forgotten you were lunching with her.” “I have forgotten, Bunter, and I mean to forget. I trust you told her I had succumbed to lethargic encephalitis suddenly, no flowers by request.” “Lady Swaffham said, my lord, she was counting on you. She met the Duchess of Denver yesterday ” “If my sister-in-law’s there I won’t go, that’s flat,” said Lord Peter. “I beg your pardon, my lord, the Dowager Duchess.” “What’s she doing in town?” “I imagine she came up for the inquest, my lord.” “Oh, yes we missed that, Bunter.” “Yes, my lord. Her Grace is lunching with Lady Swaffham.",0
"Besides, that was a flea-bite to what I should have to do later. I put Levy on the table, wheeled him across to the hospital and substituted him for my interesting pauper. I was sorry to have to abandon the idea of getting a look at the latter’s brain, but I could not afford to incur suspicion. It was still rather early, so I knocked down a few minutes getting Levy ready for dissection. Then I put my pauper on the table and trundled him over to the house. It was now five past eleven, and I thought I might conclude that the servants were in bed. I carried the body into my bedroom. He was rather heavy, but less so than Levy, and my Alpine experience had taught me how to handle bodies.",0
"Wort, the American plenipotentiary, through a series of diplomatic dinners to eminent financiers, down to intimate family gatherings of persons designated by Christian names or nicknames. About May there came a mention of Lady Levy’s nerves, and further reference was made to the subject in subsequent months. In September it was stated that “Freke came to see my dear wife and advised complete rest and change of scene. She thinks of going abroad with Rachel.",0
"“I always thought that was so ingenious,” she said, gazing soulfully at Lord Peter, “and do you know, as it happened, Tommy had just made me insure my life, and I got so frightened, I gave up my morning bath and took to having it in the afternoon when he was in the House I mean, when he was not in the house not at home, I mean.” “Dear lady,” said Lord Peter, reproachfully, “I have a distinct recollection that all those brides were thoroughly unattractive. But it was an uncommonly ingenious plan the first time of askin’ only he shouldn’t have repeated himself.” “One demands a little originality in these days, even from murderers,” said Lady Swaffham.",0
"So when your lad told me about Duke’s Denver I took the liberty to subscribe without waiting for the Bazaar.” “I’m sure it was very kind of you,” said the Duchess. “You are coming to the Bazaar, then?” she continued, gazing into his face appealingly. “Sure thing,” said Mr. Milligan, with great promptness. “Lord Peter said you’d let me know for sure about the date, but we can always make time for a little bit of good work anyway. Of course I’m hoping to be able to avail myself of your kind invitation to stop, but if I’m rushed, I’ll manage anyhow to pop over and speak my piece and pop back again.",0
"Why should they? The only person who thinks they have is Sugg, and he’s nothing to go by. It would be different if there were any truth in the suggestion that the man in the bath was Levy, but we know for a certainty he wasn’t. It’s ridiculous to suppose that the same man was employed in committing two totally distinct crimes on the same night, one in Battersea and the other in Park Lane.” “I know,” said Wimsey, “though of course we mustn’t forget that Levy was in Battersea at the time, and now we know he didn’t return home at twelve as was supposed, we’ve no reason to think he ever left Battersea at all.",0
"Clubs: White’s; Oxford and Cambridge; Alpine, etc. Recreations: Chess, Mountaineering, Fishing. Address: 282, Harley Street and St. Luke’s House, Prince of Wales Road, Battersea Park, S.W.11. He flung the book away. “Confirmation!” he groaned. “As if I needed it!” He sat down again and buried his face in his hands. He remembered quite suddenly how, years ago, he had stood before the breakfast table at Denver Castle a small, peaky boy in blue knickers, with a thunderously beating heart.",0
"I supposed that a thoughtful old man like Levy would put his boots handy for his valet, and I ought to have deduced that he would fold up his clothes. That was a mistake, but not an important one. Remembering that well-thought-out little work of Mr. Bentley’s, I had examined Levy’s mouth for false teeth, but he had none. I did not forget, however, to wet his tooth-brush. At one o’clock I got up and dressed in my own clothes by the light of my own pocket torch. I dared not turn on the bedroom lights, as there were light blinds to the windows. I put on my own boots and an old pair of goloshes outside the door.",0
"‘Sie haben sich so weit darin eingeheimnisst’ that, like Sludge the Medium, they are beginning to believe their own nonsense. I should like to have the exploring of some of their brains, Mr. Parker; I would show you the little faults and landslips in the cells the misfiring and short-circuiting of the nerves, which produce these notions and these books. At least,” he added, gazing sombrely at his guest, “at least, if I could not quite show you today, I shall be able to do so tomorrow or in a year’s time or before I die.",0
"Here am I, sweating my brains out to introduce a really sensational incident into your dull and disreputable little police investigation, and you refuse to show a single spark of enthusiasm.” “Well, it’s no good jumping at conclusions.” “Jump? You don’t even crawl distantly within sight of a conclusion. I believe if you caught the cat with her head in the cream-jug you’d say it was conceivable that the jug was empty when she got there.” “Well, it would be conceivable, wouldn’t it?” “Curse you,” said Lord Peter. He screwed his monocle into his eye, and bent over the pillow, breathing hard and tightly through his nose. “Here, give me the tweezers,” he said presently.",0
"An’ if you found that the lawyer and the doctor had once upon a time been in business at Poggleton-on-the-Marsh when the Bishop had been vicar there, you’d begin to remember you’d once heard of me payin’ a visit to Poggleton-on-the-Marsh a long time ago, an’ you’d begin to look up the parish registers there an’ discover I’d been married under an assumed name by the vicar to the widow of a wealthy farmer, who’d died suddenly of peritonitis, as certified by the doctor, after the lawyer’d made a will leavin’ me all her money, and then you’d begin to think I might have very good reasons for gettin’ rid of such promisin’ blackmailers as the lawyer, the doctor an’ the bishop.",0
"“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! you always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.” “There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir my lord, I should say, but there! my nerves are all to pieces.",0
"He smoked quantities of cigarettes without a holder. He was particular about his personal appearance.” “Did you examine the room at all? I didn’t get a chance.” “I couldn’t find much in the way of footprints. Sugg & Co. had tramped all over the place, to say nothing of little Thipps and the maid, but I noticed a very indefinite patch just behind the head of the bath, as though something damp might have stood there. You could hardly call it a print.” “It rained hard all last night, of course.",0
"""I hope so very much,” said the Duchess. “I must see what can be done about the date of course, I can’t promise ” “No, no,” said Mr. Milligan heartily. “I know what these things are to fix up. And then there’s not only me there’s all the real big men of European eminence your son mentioned, to be consulted.” The Duchess turned pale at the thought that any one of these illustrious persons might some time turn up in somebody’s drawing-room, but by this time she had dug herself in comfortably, and was even beginning to find her range.",0
"He then dismissed them, with the unspoken adjuration to be quick about it. Sir Julian Freke, after giving his evidence, had caught the eye of the Duchess, and now came over and greeted her. “I haven’t seen you for an age,” said that lady. “How are you?” “Hard at work,” said the specialist. “Just got my new book out. This kind of thing wastes time. Have you seen Lady Levy yet?” “No, poor dear,” said the Duchess. “I only came up this morning, for this. Mrs. Thipps is staying with me one of Peter’s eccentricities, you know. Poor Christine! I must run round and see her.",0
"Tuesday morning saw Lord Peter and a man in a velveteen jacket swishing merrily through seven acres of turnip-tops, streaked yellow with early frosts. A little way ahead, a sinuous undercurrent of excitement among the leaves proclaimed the unseen yet ever-near presence of one of the Duke of Denver’s setter pups. Presently a partridge flew up with a noise like a police rattle, and Lord Peter accounted for it very creditably for a man who, a few nights before, had been listening to imaginary German sappers.",0
"You don’t know how important it is.” “Not on any account, my lord. It would be as much as my place is worth.” “The trousers are all right, Bunter.” “Not for Lady Swaffham’s, my lord. Besides, your lordship forgets the man that ran against you with a milk-can at Salisbury.” And Mr. Bunter laid an accusing finger on a slight stain of grease showing across the light cloth. “I wish to God I’d never let you grow into a privileged family retainer, Bunter,” said Lord Peter, bitterly, dashing his walking-stick into the umbrella-stand. “You’ve no conception of the mistakes my mother may be making.",0
"He took his chances, and won. He walked upstairs, he undressed, he even washed and cleaned his teeth, though he didn’t use the hair-brush for fear of leaving red hairs in it. He had to guess what Levy did with boots and clothes; one guess was wrong and the other right, as it happened. The bed must look as if it had been slept in, so he gets in, and lies there in his victim’s very pyjamas. Then, in the morning sometime, probably in the deadest hour between two and three, he gets up, dresses himself in his own clothes that he has brought with him in a bag, and creeps downstairs.",0
"And I will give you a prescription.” “Thank you.” Sir Julian got up and went into a small surgery leading out of the consulting-room. Lord Peter watched him moving about boiling something and writing. Presently he returned with a paper and a hypodermic syringe. “Here is the prescription. And now, if you will just roll up your sleeve, I will deal with the necessity of the immediate moment.” Lord Peter obediently rolled up his sleeve. Sir Julian Freke selected a portion of his forearm and anointed it with iodine. “What’s that you’re goin’ to stick into me.",0
"As soon as the Stock Exchange opened I telephoned my various brokers, and by exercising a little care, was able to sell out the greater part of my Peruvian stock on a rising market. Towards the end of the day, however, buyers became rather unsettled as a result of Levy’s death, and in the end I did not make more than a few hundreds by the transaction. Trusting I have now made clear to you any point which you may have found obscure, and with congratulations on the good fortune and perspicacity which have enabled you to defeat me, I remain, with kind remembrances to your mother, Yours very truly, JULIAN FREKE Post-Scriptum: My will is made, leaving my money to St.",0
"You may come to want me yourself, you never know. When anybody comes blackmailin’ you, Gerald, or your first deserted wife turns up unexpectedly from the West Indies, you’ll realize the pull of havin’ a private detective in the family. ‘Delicate private business arranged with tact and discretion. Investigations undertaken. Divorce evidence a specialty. Every guarantee!’ Come, now.” “Ass!” said Lord Denver, throwing the newspaper violently into his armchair. “When do you want the car?” “Almost at once. I say, Jerry, I’m taking Mother up with me.” “Why should she be mixed up in it?” “Well, I want her help.",0
"I had an overcoat of much the same pattern as Levy’s, and had taken the precaution to pack an opera hat in my suitcase. I hoped the man would not notice that I had no umbrella this time. Fortunately the rain had diminished for the moment to a sort of drizzle, and if he noticed anything he made no observation. I told him to stop at 50 Overstrand Mansions, and I paid him off there, and stood under the porch till he had driven away. Then I hurried round to my own side door and let myself in. It was about a quarter to two, and the harder part of my task still lay before me.",0
"“I say, old man,” he said suddenly, as Parker was letting him out, “does it occur to you that Freke’s story doesn’t fit in awfully well with what Anderson said about the old boy having been so jolly at dinner on Monday night? Would you be, if you thought you’d got anything of that sort?” “No, I shouldn’t,” said Parker; “but,” he added with his habitual caution, “some men will jest in the dentist’s waiting-room. You, for one.” “Well, that’s true,” said Lord Peter, and went downstairs. Lord Peter reached home about midnight, feeling extraordinarily wakeful and alert.",0
"“You are sure he didn’t take a second pair?” “His man vouches for it that he had only two pairs, one of which was found on his dressing-table, and the other in the drawer where it is always kept.” Lord Peter whistled. “You’ve got me there, Parker. Even if he’d gone out to commit suicide he’d have taken those.” “So you’d think or the suicide would have happened the first time he started to cross the road. However, I didn’t overlook the possibility. I’ve got particulars of all today’s street accidents, and I can lay my hand on my heart and say that none of them is Sir Reuben.",0
"Colegrove? A wonderful surgeon I saw him when he was at Guy’s. Oh, no, gave it up years ago. Nothing like keeping your hand in. Ah yes, undoubtedly that’s it. Have you a towel handy, sir? Thank you. Over the head, if you please I think we might have another here. Now, Lady Levy I am going to ask you to look at a scar, and see if you recognise it. I’m sure you are going to help us by being very firm. Take your time you won’t see anything more than you absolutely must.” “Lucy, don’t leave me.” “No, dear.” A space cleared at the table. The lamplight on the Duchess’s white hair. “Oh, yes oh, yes! No, no I couldn’t be mistaken. There’s that funny little kink in it. I’ve seen it hundreds of times.",0
"“My true friend,” he murmured in a voice surcharged with emotion, “you recall me to the nursery rhymes of my youth the sacred duty of flippancy: “There was an old man of Whitehaven Who danced a quadrille with a raven, But they said: It’s absurd To encourage that bird So they smashed that old man of Whitehaven. That’s the correct attitude, Parker. Here’s a poor old buffer spirited away such a joke and I don’t believe he’d hurt a fly himself that makes it funnier. D’you know, Parker, I don’t care frightfully about this case after all.” “Which, this or yours?” “Both.",0
"What do you say to that?” “Oh, these self-made men of low origin don’t think much about teeth, and are terrified of dentists.” “True; but one of the molars has a broken edge so rough that it had made a sore place on the tongue. Nothing’s more painful. D’you mean to tell me a man would put up with that if he could afford to get the tooth filed?” “Well, people are queer. I’ve known servants endure agonies rather than step over a dentist’s doormat. How did you see that, Wimsey?” “Had a look inside; electric torch,” said Lord Peter.",0
"Parker made the encouraging noise which, among laymen, supplies the place of the priest’s insinuating, “Yes, my son?” “Sir Reuben Levy’s visit on Monday night was to me,” said Sir Julian. “Yes?” said Mr. Parker, without expression. “He found cause for certain grave suspicions concerning his health,” said Sir Julian, slowly, as though weighing how much he could in honour disclose to a stranger. “He came to me, in preference to his own medical man, as he was particularly anxious that the matter should be kept from his wife. As I told you, he knew me fairly well, and Lady Levy had consulted me about a nervous disorder in the summer.",0
"I should wish to add, as a tribute to the great merits of your lordship’s cellar, that, although I was obliged to drink a somewhat large quantity both of the Cockburn ’68 and the 1800 Napoleon I feel no headache or other ill effects this morning. Trusting that your lordship is deriving real benefit from the country air, and that the little information I have been able to obtain will prove satisfactory, I remain. With respectful duty to all the family, Obediently yours, MERVYN BUNTER. “Y’know,” said Lord Peter thoughtfully to himself, “I sometimes think Mervyn Bunter’s pullin’ my leg. What is it, Soames?” “A telegram, my lord.",0
"Besides, why three? Cummings never saw him again till he called him for eight o’clock breakfast.” “But he was having a bath at three.” “I don’t say he didn’t get back from Park Lane before three. But I don’t suppose Cummings went and looked through the bathroom keyhole to see if he was in the bath.” Parker considered again. “How about Crimplesham’s pince-nez?” he asked. “That is a bit mysterious,” said Lord Peter. “And why Thipps’s bathroom?” “Why, indeed? Pure accident, perhaps or pure devilry.” “Do you think all this elaborate scheme could have been put together in a night, Wimsey?” “Far from it. It was conceived as soon as that man who bore a superficial resemblance to Levy came into the workhouse.",0
"” He sat down to the telephone with an air of leisurely courtesy, as though it were an acquaintance dropped in for a chat. “Hullo, Mother that you?” “Oh, there you are, dear,” replied the voice of the Dowager Duchess. “I was afraid I’d just missed you.” “Well, you had, as a matter of fact. I’d just started off to Brocklebury’s sale to pick up a book or two, but I had to come back for the catalogue. What’s up?” “Such a quaint thing,” said the Duchess. “I thought I’d tell you. You know little Mr. Thipps?” “Thipps?” said Lord Peter. “Thipps? Oh, yes, the little architect man who’s doing the church roof. Yes. What about him?” “Mrs.",0
"His heroes are Edmond de la Pommerais, who persuaded his mistress into becoming an accessory to her own murder, and George Joseph Smith of Brides-in-a-bath fame, who could make passionate love to his wife in the night and carry out his plot to murder her in the morning. After all, he thinks conscience is a sort of vermiform appendix. Chop it out and you’ll feel all the better. Freke isn’t troubled by the usual conscientious deterrent. Witness his own hand in his books. Now again.",0
"The lurching departure of the Dante demons good, decent demons in corduroy. Dr. Grimbold’s voice cool and detached as if in the consulting room. “Now have you got that lamp, Mr. Wingate? Thank you. Yes, here on the table, please. Be careful not to catch your elbow in the flex, Mr. Levett. It would be better, I think, if you came on this side. Yes yes thank you. That’s excellent.” The sudden brilliant circle of an electric lamp over the table. Dr. Grimbold’s beard and spectacles. Mr. Levett blowing his nose. Parker bending close. The Master of the Workhouse peering over him.",0
"As I was turning into Mortimer Street I noticed a girl of about twenty-two with black hair and brown eyes, wearing a green jumper, check skirt, Panama hat and black shoes, riding a Royal Sunbeam Cycle at about ten miles an hour turning the corner by the Church of St. Simon and St. Jude on the wrong side of the road riding towards the market place!’ It amounts to that, of course, but it’s really wormed out of him by a series of questions.",0
"Of course, if this were a detective story, there’d have been a convenient shower exactly an hour before the crime and a beautiful set of marks which could only have come there between two and three in the morning, but this being real life in a London November, you might as well expect footprints in Niagara. I searched the roofs right along and came to the jolly conclusion that any person in any blessed flat in the blessed row might have done it. All the staircases open on to the roof and the leads are quite flat; you can walk along as easy as along Shaftesbury Avenue. Still, I’ve got some evidence that the body did walk along there.",0
"""Well, why can’t you?” said Lord Peter, standing on the hearthrug and smiling down at his guest. “Well,” said the young man, “the chaps who examine one don’t ask the same sort of questions you do.” “No?” “No they leave you to remember all by yourself. And it’s beastly hard. Nothing to catch hold of, don’t you know? But, I say how did you know about Tommy Pringle being the funny man and ” “I didn’t, till you told me.” “No; I know. But how did you know he’d be there if you did ask? I mean to say I say,” said Mr.",0
"The Duke eyed him doubtfully. “Hope to goodness you don’t go and marry a chorus beauty,” he muttered inwardly, and returned to the Times. Over dinner I had set myself to discover Cummings’s tastes, and found them to run in the direction of the music-hall stage. During his first glass I drew him out in this direction, your lordship having kindly given me opportunities of seeing every performance in London, and I spoke more freely than I should consider becoming in the ordinary way in order to make myself pleasant to him.",0
"""And in short stories,” said Lord Peter, “it has to be put in statement form, because the real conversation would be so long and twaddly and tedious, and nobody would have the patience to read it. Writers have to consider their readers, if any, y’see.” “Yes,” said Mr. Piggott, “but I bet you most people would find it jolly difficult to remember, even if you asked ’em things. I should of course, I know I’m a bit of a fool, but then, most people are, ain’t they? You know what I mean. Witnesses ain’t detectives, they’re just average idiots like you and me.",0
"” He had drifted across the passage into his bedroom, and was changing with a rapidity one might not have expected from a man of his mannerisms. He selected a dark-green tie to match his socks and tied it accurately without hesitation or the slightest compression of his lips; substituted a pair of brown shoes for his black ones, slipped a monocle into a breast pocket, and took up a beautiful Malacca walking-stick with a heavy silver knob. “That’s all, I think,” he murmured to himself. “Stay I may as well have you you may come in useful one never knows.",0
"There’s this thing at the corner, marked F, but that you can disregard; in the original document it’s a sticky mark left by the thumb of the youth who took it from me, after first removing a piece of chewing-gum from his teeth with his finger to tell me that Mr. Milligan might or might not be disengaged. D and E are the thumb-marks of Mr. Milligan and his red-haired secretary. I’m not clear which is which, but I saw the youth with the chewing-gum hand the card to the secretary, and when I got into the inner shrine I saw John P. Milligan standing with it in his hand, so it’s one or the other, and for the moment it’s immaterial to our purpose which is which.",0
"Was the exertion of solving the problem attended by any bad results physically?” “None.” “No. You were interested, but not distressed.” “Exactly.” “Yes. You have been engaged in other investigations of the kind?” “Yes. Little ones.” “With bad results for your health?” “Not a bit of it. On the contrary. I took up these cases as a sort of distraction. I had a bad knock just after the war, which didn’t make matters any better for me, don’t you know.” “Ah! you are not married?” “No.” “No. Will you allow me to make an examination? Just come a little nearer to the light. I want to see your eyes. Whose advice have you had till now?” “Sir James Hodges’.",0
"She was very much afraid she ’adn’t shut the window on Monday night, though she wished her ’ead ’ad been cut off afore she’d been so forgetful. Here the witness burst into tears and was given some water, while the Coroner refreshed himself with a third lozenge. Recovering, witness stated that she had certainly looked into all the rooms before going to bed. No, it was quite impossible for a body to be ’idden in the flat without her seeing of it. She ’ad been in the kitchen all evening, and there wasn’t ’ardly room to keep the best dinner service there, let alone a body.",0
"""None unless he was a most consummate actor. Whatever happened to change his mind must have happened either at the mysterious appointment which he kept after dinner, or while he was in bed between midnight and 5.30 a.m.” “Well, Bunter,” said Lord Peter, “what do you make of it?” “Not in my department, my lord. Except that it is odd that a gentleman who was too flurried or unwell to fold his clothes as usual should remember to clean his teeth and put his boots out. Those are two things that quite frequently get overlooked, my lord.",0
"I see red if anybody questions my judgment about a book. And Levy who was nobody twenty years ago romps in and carries off Freke’s girl from under his nose. It isn’t the girl Freke would bother about it’s having his aristocratic nose put out of joint by a little Jewish nobody. “There’s another thing. Freke’s got another side-issue. He likes crime. In that criminology book of his he gloats over a hardened murderer. I’ve read it, and I’ve seen the admiration simply glaring out between the lines whenever he writes about a callous and successful criminal. He reserves his contempt for the victims or the penitents or the men who lose their heads and get found out.",0
"It seemed, however, as though the man had melted out of society without leaving a gap or so much as a ripple. Assigning a motive for the murder of a person without relations or antecedents or even clothes is like trying to visualize the fourth dimension admirable exercise for the imagination, but arduous and inconclusive. Even if the day’s interview should disclose black spots in the past or present of Mr.",0
"“Wait a second,” he said. “I’ve thought of something. If Sugg’s there he’ll make trouble. I must short-circuit him.” He ran back, and the other two men employed the few minutes of his absence in capturing a taxi. Inspector Sugg and a subordinate Cerberus were on guard at 59, Queen Caroline Mansions, and showed no disposition to admit unofficial inquirers. Parker, indeed, they could not easily turn away, but Lord Peter found himself confronted with a surly manner and what Lord Beaconsfield described as a masterly inactivity. It was in vain that Lord Peter pleaded that he had been retained by Mrs. Thipps on behalf of her son.",0
"“By the way,” said Lord Peter, “to skip across for a moment to the other case, has it occurred to you that perhaps Levy was going out to see Freke on Monday night?” “He was; he did,” said Parker, rather unexpectedly, and proceeded to recount his interview with the nerve-specialist. “Humph!” said Lord Peter. “I say, Parker, these are funny cases, ain’t they? Every line of inquiry seems to peter out. It’s awfully exciting up to a point, you know, and then nothing comes of it. It’s like rivers getting lost in the sand.” “Yes,” said Parker. “And there’s another one I lost this morning.” “What’s that?” “Oh, I was pumping Levy’s secretary about his business.",0
"Shall I go an’ eat my lunch in the corner?” Lady Swaffham gracefully forgave the culprit. “Your dear mother is here,” she said. “How do, Mother?” said Lord Peter, uneasily. “How are you, dear?” replied the Duchess. “You really oughtn’t to have turned up just yet. Mr. Milligan was just going to tell me what a thrilling speech he’s preparing for the Bazaar, when you came and interrupted us.” Conversation at lunch turned, not unnaturally, on the Battersea inquest, the Duchess giving a vivid impersonation of Mrs. Thipps being interrogated by the Coroner.",0
"“I am ashamed ” “That’s all right,” said Parker, cheerily. “I can wait.” He assisted Freke into the taxi. “What number? 24 Russell Square, driver, and look sharp.” The taxi drove off. Parker remounted the stairs and rang Lord Peter’s bell. “Thanks, old man,” he said. “I’ll stop the night, after all.” “Come in,” said Wimsey. “Did you see that?” asked Parker. “I saw something. What happened exactly?” Parker told his story. “Frankly,” he said, “I’ve been thinking you a bit mad, but now I’m not quite so sure of it.” Peter laughed.",0
"“What d’you suppose has happened to the old man?” “Cursed if I know,” said the Honourable Freddy; “knocked on the head by the bears, I should think.” “P’r’aps he’s gone off on his own,” suggested Lord Peter. “Double life, you know. Giddy old blighters, some of these City men.” “Oh, no,” said the Honourable Freddy, faintly roused; “no, hang it all, Wimsey, I wouldn’t care to say that. He’s a decent old domestic bird, and his daughter’s a charmin’ girl. Besides, he’s straight enough he’d do you down fast enough, but he wouldn’t let you down. Old Anderson is badly cut up about it.” “Who’s Anderson?” “Chap with property out there.",0
"""Dozens, dear such a dreadful place, the City, isn’t it? Everybody Ishmaels together though I don’t suppose Sir Reuben would like to be called that, would he? Doesn’t it mean illegitimate, or not a proper Jew, anyway? I always did get confused with those Old Testament characters.” Lord Peter laughed and yawned. “I think I’ll turn in for an hour or two,” he said. “I must be back in town at eight Parker’s coming to breakfast.” The Duchess looked at the clock, which marked five minutes to three. “I’ll send up your breakfast at half-past six, dear,” she said. “I hope you’ll find everything all right.",0
"Similarly, he thinks Mr. Thipps may have concealed the body in the box-room or elsewhere. Therefore you may be sure he searched the box-room and all the other places for signs of occupation. If they had been there he would have found them, because he was looking for them. Therefore, if he didn’t find them it’s because they weren’t there.” “All right,” said Parker, “stop talking. I believe you.” He went on to detail the medical evidence.",0
"Upon receiving a message from the medical officer at the Chelsea workhouse about an injured vagrant showing intriguing nervous and cerebral reactions, I seized the chance to investigate. The man bore a striking resemblance to Sir Reuben, a detail that immediately caught my attention.",1
"""I concur on the cause of death."" ""Yes, in essence."" ""Will you share your thoughts with the Jury?"" ""I was at St. Luke’s Hospital's dissecting room around nine on Monday morning when Inspector Sugg approached me. He mentioned a man found dead under mysterious circumstances at 59 Queen Caroline Mansions. Asked if it could be a medical student's prank.""",1

Mr. Smith carefully stored the umbrella handle with his other belongings, then proceeded to hang a sheet over the window with the assistance of the housekeeper. ""Excellent,"" he declared. ""If I could just have this blanket draped over the table and another one on a towel rack for a suitable backdrop - you're most helpful, Mrs. Brown.""",1
"“Pemming.... Oh! If only his lordship didn't require valeting at night. Countless are the nights I've stayed up until three or four, only to rise early to accompany him on his Sherlocking escapades across the country. And the dirt he tracks in on his garments and boots!” “It's truly disgraceful, Mr. Bunter,” Mrs. Pemming chimed in, with passion. “Vulgar, I dare say. In my humble opinion, detective work is not a suitable pursuit for a man of his stature, let alone a lord.” “And everything so needlessly complicated,” Mr.",1
"“D. put Thipps in quod,” said the Duchess.  “Sugg needs to arrest someone,” Lord Peter replied.  “There is evidence that supports Sugg’s theory, but I know it's not true based on what I saw last night around 9.”",1
"""Listen up, Peter,” the other man spoke with urgency, “you need to let go of this Eton playing-fields complex. Something terrible has befallen Sir Reuben Levy. Let's call it murder for argument's sake. If Sir Reuben was indeed murdered, is it just a game to you? And is it right to treat it as such?” “I'm truly ashamed,” Lord Peter confessed. “At first, it's all a game to me. I proceed with enthusiasm, but then I realize that someone will get hurt, and I want to back out.” “I understand, I understand,” the detective nodded, “but that's because you're focused on your own perspective.""",1
"""During my college years, I was surrounded by a crowd of scholars like Conybeare, Robertson, and Drews. They were consumed with the search for an unseen burglar, neglecting the more obvious clues under their noses. It was during this time that I honed my sense of caution, a skill that has served me well."" Lord Peter remarked, ""Your theological studies seem to have sharpened your wits, making you the most cautious person I know."" Parker replied, ""No worries, I don't mind the interruption.""",1
"My mother, a woman full of energy and selflessness, is considering organizing a charity event in Denver to raise funds for the church roof. Mr. Milligan's antique English windows and angel roof are deteriorating, causing rain to pour in and giving the vicar rheumatism.",1
"""Always mind your manners at the table,"" Lord Peter lectured, offering a spoonful of Oxford marmalade before reaching for his Dante. ""The auction of Lord Erith’s collection is making headlines in the Morning Post. But first, let's delve into Sir Julian Freke’s latest work on ‘The Physiological Bases of the Conscience’ in the Times Literary Supplement,"" Bunter suggested.",1
"Lord Peter emerged into the city, pondering the impossibility of transplanting Scoot's head onto Milligan's shoulders. Meanwhile, Mr. Parker, a bachelor, resided in a Georgian yet inconvenient flat at No. 12A Great Ormond Street, paying a mere pound weekly. Despite his efforts in civilization's favor, his rewards were modest - a salary funded by the British taxpayer, rather than lavish gifts from empresses or Prime Ministers.",1
"""If you have any personal intentions, Bunter,"" Lord Peter remarked, ""I must say that I find the speech rather inappropriate. It's quite an interesting little puzzle, my dear Parker. Listen, I don't want to interfere, but I would really like to take a look at that bedroom tomorrow. It's not that I don't trust you, my friend, but I am very curious to see it for myself. Please don't refuse me, have another sip of brandy and a Villar Villar, but do not refuse me!"" ""Certainly, you are welcome to come and inspect it, you might discover details that I have missed,"" the other replied calmly, appreciating the offer of hospitality. ""Parker, my dear, you bring great credit to Scotland Yard.""",1
"I discovered the items in my pocket while searching for a penknife to cut a knot. I immediately recognized how they could enhance his appearance, while also adding an element of deception. After discreetly placing them on him, I erased any evidence of my presence and left undetected, moving smoothly between the drain-pipe and the rope. Upon my return, I retraced my steps, retrieved my gear, and was greeted by my trusty accomplice. Making sure not to make any noise, I completed my tasks and decided it was time for some rest after spending a considerable amount of time in the bath.",1
"Parker lounged in a worn armchair, resting his feet on the mantelpiece, engrossed in a contemporary interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians. Greeting Lord Peter with a calm demeanor, he prepared a whisky-and-soda. Peter picked up the abandoned book, scanning the text thoughtfully. ""These men all have their own perspectives,"" he remarked, ""they see what they want to see."" ""Indeed,"" the detective replied, ""but we've learned to see past that, almost instinctively.""",1
"Lady Levy was considered a redeeming point. The Honourable Freddy spoke highly of her family, especially her self-made father who valued every penny he earned.

"As numerous witnesses took the stand to vouch for the reputations of Mr. Thipps and Gladys Horrocks, the Coroner announced his plan to shift the focus to the medical testimony. The entrance of Sir Julian Freke caused a commotion in the courtroom. The renowned specialist exuded an air of distinction, standing tall with broad shoulders and a commanding presence. When handed the Book by the Coroner's officer, his demeanor was one of indulgence, akin to St. Paul tolerating the beliefs of the superstitious Corinthians.",1
"He then settled back in his chair, lighting his pipe before beginning, ""Let me regale you with the tale of the ruthless and unyielding Crimplesham."" Recounting his trip to Salisbury, he explained how Mr. Crimplesham had willingly shared every intricate detail of his time in the city. ""I've verified it all,"" Lord Peter sighed, ""and unless he's managed to bribe half of Balham, there's no question that he was there that night. The entire afternoon was accounted for with the bank officials. It appears that a multitude of Salisbury locals witnessed his departure on Monday morning.""",1
"I glanced around discreetly before leaning in closer to him, my voice barely above a whisper: ""I have some insider knowledge on this, but it needs to stay between us. There's a significant profit to be made.""   ""But isn't it a failing investment?"" he questioned, skepticism evident in his tone.   ""It has been,"" I admitted, ""but that's about to change. Trust me, I have reliable information.""   He appeared doubtful, so I finished my drink and moved even nearer, ensuring my words were for his ears only. ""I don't share this with just anyone, but I'm willing to help you and Christine out. She's always held a special place in my heart, even after all this time.""",1
"""His mind buzzed with a swarm of thoughts, like bees disturbed from their hive. It was as if he was staring at a complex puzzle, the solution just out of reach. 'I hold the key to this mystery,' Lord Peter muttered to himself. 'I know it's somewhere, I just can't recall where. Someone mentioned it. Maybe it was me. I can't place it, but I know it's there. Bunter, go to bed. I'll stay up a bit longer.' With a robe draped over his shoulders, he settled in front of the fireplace, puffing on his pipe while his vibrant peacocks kept watch.""",1
"“The usual bore. Why?” “I had a feeling you might be,” the specialist replied, with a hint of sarcasm. “You are aware that the stress endured during the war has left a lasting impact on you. It has created what I would describe as scars in your mind. Signals transmitted by your nerves to your brain triggered subtle physical alterations that are only now becoming detectable, even with our most advanced instruments. These alterations then sparked sensations; or rather, sensations are what we label these tissue changes when we become aware of them: we name them terror, anxiety, burden of guilt, and the like.",1
"Did someone help him place it there? And for what reason? Did it enter through the front door, as Sugg theorizes? Or was it brought in through the window, as we suspect based on the faint mark on the window ledge? Were there others involved in the crime? Is Thipps involved, or perhaps the girl? We shouldn't dismiss ideas simply because Sugg suggests them. Even fools can accidentally stumble upon the truth. If not, why was Thipps targeted for such a cruel prank? Does someone hold a grudge against Thipps? Who resides in the neighboring apartments? That is something we need to uncover.",1
"""Freke made a mistake,"" Holmes said. ""He was guarding against starting a train of thought in the mind of anybody, such as the workhouse doctor."" Watson nodded, understanding the implications of Holmes' deduction.",1
"He had only caught glimpses of Sir Julian Freke from afar, never up close. As he recounted the details of his recent nervous breakdown, he couldn't help but study the man standing before him. Sir Julian was taller, broader, with hands that seemed almost otherworldly. His face was strikingly beautiful yet somehow inhuman, with intense blue eyes that seemed to pierce right through Lord Peter. These were not the warm, comforting eyes of a family doctor, but the eyes of a passionate and fanatical scientist. ""Well,"" Lord Peter thought to himself, ""at least I won't need to explain everything."" ""Yes,"" Sir Julian nodded, ""yes. You've been pushing yourself too hard.""",1
"At the Minster Hotel, you will find me before tomorrow morning,"" announced Mr. Crimplesham. He simply directed the clerk to remove the intruder without further ado. As Lord Peter made his exit, he accidentally bumped into a young man who seemed to recognize him. Perplexed, Lord Peter called out for Bunter and left for his hotel to place a trunk-call to Parker. Back in the office, Mr. Crimplesham's contemplations were disrupted by the arrival of his junior partner.",1
"“What was Sir Julian doing with the head?”  “He called us up and gave us a lecture on spinal hemorrhage and nervous lesions.”  “Yes. Well, let's circle back to Tommy Pringle.”  Tommy Pringle’s joke was retold, causing some discomfort.  “Indeed. Anything else?”  “The associate working with Tommy mentioned that overfeeding was the cause.”  “I infer that Tommy Pringle's partner was knowledgeable about the digestive system.”  “Yes; Tommy commented that if he had known they would overfeed you like that, he would rather go to the workhouse himself.”  “So, the individual was a resident of the workhouse?”  “Indeed, that seems likely.”",1
"“Excessive caution is the downfall of many criminals,” remarked Parker. Lord Peter commented on the foggy weather before getting ready. Lord Peter expressed his satisfaction in having Parker handle the mundane tasks. Parker confirmed he had taken care of keeping the situation under wraps. Lord Peter inquired about any potential issues with the warrant, and Parker assured him that he had ensured the workhouse and police remained silent.",1
"In the midst of his initial greeting, he quickly offered a meek apology, citing a collision with the dining-room door in the darkness. Lord Peter's considerate gesture of calling deeply moved him, nearly bringing him to tears. ""Your lordship's kindness is truly appreciated,"" he reiterated, his feeble eyelids fluttering. ""I am grateful beyond words, and Mother would be too, if only she could hear. It's been a trying day,"" he continued, ""with the constant presence of the police and the chaos that ensued.""",1
"""'Old Joey Bagstock is one tough cookie,' he remarked casually. The waiter responded with a puzzled expression, ""Is that so, sir?"" Lord Peter quickly apologized, ""My mistake, I was just reciting some poetry. Silly habit, really."" The waiter graciously accepted a generous tip, saying, ""Thank you, sir. The house you seek is not far. Just before Penny-farthing Street, take a right and you'll find it."" Lord Peter sighed, ""Well, that rules out Crimplesham-X. It's a shame, he fit the sinister image I had imagined so well.""",1
"""Yes; were you able to observe the faint traces of soot on the window ledge?” “I did,” Wimsey replied, “and I scrutinized it closely with this magnifying glass, yet I could discern nothing conclusive other than an object had been placed on the sill.” He retrieved his monocle and passed it to Parker. “Goodness, what a strong lens.” “Indeed,” Wimsey remarked, “quite handy when you wish to closely inspect something and appear utterly absurd in the process.""",1
"""I noticed they postponed the hearing,"" Parker remarked. ""It was inevitable,"" Lord Peter responded. ""Lady Levy is here now, she will need to try and fail to identify the deceased this morning to help Sugg."" ""About time,"" Mr. Parker added. There was a moment of silence. ""Your handling of the break-in was unimpressive, Bunter,"" Lord Peter critiqued. ""Efficient, yes, but lacking creativity. I prefer a criminal with imagination. Where is the Morning Post?"" Another pause followed, then Lord Peter spoke up again: ""Bunter, fetch the catalog, I believe that Apollonios Rhodios might be of interest.""",1
"""Did you make the decision to go through with it?"" ""Yes."" ""And you were sure about it?"" ""Absolutely."" ""You were prepared to act, no matter the consequences."" ""That's correct."" ""There was a period of waiting involved, right?"" ""Yes, a period of waiting."" ""A time of uncertainty, perhaps?"" ""Definitely a time of uncertainty."" ""Was there danger lurking?"" ""I hadn't thought about it that way."" ""You were not the only one affected by this."" ""If that's how you want to see it."" ""Exactly. You experienced these episodes frequently in 1918?"" ""Yes, I was quite ill for a few months.""",1
"""No can do, Sugg, your hand's full. I'm about to up the ante."" With his entourage trailing behind, he entered the room. The corpse had been taken away hours earlier, and after a thorough search by Bunter, it was clear that the true mystery of the residence was Mrs. Thipps. Her son and maid had been taken elsewhere, with no known acquaintances in the city besides a handful of Thipps's business colleagues, unknown to the elderly woman.",1
"I might mention that his opinions on women and theater were exactly what I would anticipate from a man who would indulge in tobacco with your lordship’s vintage port. Bringing up the topic of your lordship’s questions with the second glass, I shall record our discussion in the style of a dialogue to expedite matters, adhering closely to the original exchange. Cummings: You appear to have many chances to experience a taste of the high life, Mr. Bunter. Bunter: Opportunities can always be created for those who understand how. Cummings: It comes naturally to you, Mr. Bunter, to speak so freely. After all, you are not burdened with a wife.",1
"Bunter appeared with a disheveled look, his typically sleek hair now tousled by the camera. “Ah, Bunter,” Lord Peter greeted, “pay attention.” “At your service, my lord,” Mr. Bunter replied, slightly offended, “but if I may, I should be downstairs to prevent any tampering with the evidence by the young ladies, my lord.” “My apologies,” Lord Peter conceded, “but I've clashed irreparably with Mr. Parker and diverted the attention of the admirable Graves. Now, please inform me of the fingerprints you've discovered.""",1
"""Before that, he was banking on the assumption that most people don't give a second thought to something (like a body) that has already been explained.""   ""What caused him to panic?""  ""A series of unexpected events. Levy was identified as my mother's son after he foolishly revealed his connection to the Battersea aspect of the case in a Times advertisement. Detective Parker (whose picture had recently appeared in the newspapers) was spotted sitting next to the Duchess of Denver at the coroner's inquest. His goal was to keep the two parts of the mystery separate. Yet, there were two key pieces, right next to each other.""",1
"The bathroom was unassuming, with a window situated directly above the bath. Lord Peter hurried over to it, pushing it open to peer outside. Positioned on the top floor, the flat overlooked a cluster of back-yards filled with storage sheds and garages. Further beyond, lay the gardens of neighboring houses.",1
"The foolish setter dashed amongst the turnips, retrieving the lifeless bird with a wag of its tail. ""Well done,"" Lord Peter commended. In response, the dog performed a comical leap and emitted a loud bark, its ear flopping inside out. ""Come here,"" the man in velveteen commanded sternly. The dog approached, looking contrite. ""Not the brightest creature,"" remarked the man in velveteen, ""always on edge. One of Black Lass's offspring."" ""Oh my,"" Peter exclaimed, ""is Black Lass still around?"" ""No, my lord; we had to put her down last spring."" Peter nodded in understanding.",1
"I knew he would be perfect for my plans, so I quickly initiated the necessary steps in the City that I had been planning. While waiting, I found the reactions described by the workhouse doctor quite intriguing. I diligently observed and documented them, making arrangements for the body to be sent to the hospital once everything was ready.",1
"The hair, thick and naturally curly, had been expertly parted to reveal a faint scent of violet in the bathroom. The features were bold and well-defined, with dark eyes, a long nose, and a heavy chin. Full lips and stained teeth were visible on the clean-shaven face. Gold pince-nez perched elegantly on the dead man's handsome face, while a fine gold chain draped over his chest. Stiff legs and arms lay side by side, with fingers naturally flexed.",1
"“I instructed them to insert a hot-water bottle within; those linen sheets can be quite cold; feel free to remove it if it obstructs you.” Lord Peter remarked, moving his coffee-cup away and lighting his pipe after breakfast. “This might provide you with a lead, Parker, even though it hasn’t helped me with my bathroom issue. Have you made any progress since I departed?” “No; however, I have been on the roof this morning.” “Well, well, you are quite the energetic one! Parker, I must say, this collaborative plan appears to be quite promising.”",1
"""This is Mr. Parker,"" she mentioned, ""who is handling that investigation."" ""Oh,"" replied Sir Julian, taking a moment to think. ""Have you met Lady Levy yet?"" he asked Parker in a hushed tone. ""Yes, I spoke with her this morning."" ""Did she request you to continue the inquiry?"" ""Indeed,"" Parker replied. ""She suspects,"" he continued, ""that Sir Reuben might be captured by a financial competitor or that he is being held for ransom by some criminals."" ""Do you share that belief?"" inquired Sir Julian. ""I find it quite probable,"" answered Parker honestly. Sir Julian paused once more.",1
"""Poor soul! Always falling for deceivers; he passed away without ever gaining wisdom. I suspect you inherit that trait, Lord Peter."" ""I highly doubt it,"" Lord Peter replied. ""To my knowledge, he is merely a relative, but as they say, it takes a discerning child to know their true father. My apologies for intruding at this late hour, although, as you mentioned, we are family after all. I appreciate your indulgence and allowing me to appreciate that incredibly charming item you're wearing.""",1
"""He had already penned a detailed confession by the time we caught up with him, my lord. The authorities will undoubtedly need to review it, but given its intended recipient, I thought it best to share it with you first. Here you go."" Lord Peter was handed a thick stack of papers. ""Much obliged,"" he replied. ""Care to listen, Charles?"" ""Absolutely."" Lord Peter proceeded to recite from the confession. ""Dear Lord Peter, in my youth, I frequently engaged in chess matches with an acquaintance of my father's. Despite his poor skills and slow pace, he stubbornly refused to concede defeat, prolonging the games unnecessarily.""",1
"The serial killer is known for his precision in dismembering victims. Mr. Bunter and Cummings discuss the loud noises coming from the basement and cistern-room, keeping them awake all night. It seems like the killer's habits are affecting their sleep more than they'd like to admit.",1
"""Throgmorton has just been in, quite distressed."" ""Who, Mother? I couldn't quite catch that. Mrs. Who?"" ""Throgmorton Throgmorton, the vicar's wife."" ""Oh, Throgmorton, right?"" ""Mr. Thipps called them this morning. It was his scheduled visit, you see."" ""And then?"" ""He called to cancel. He was very upset, poor thing. He discovered a corpse in his bathtub."" ""I'm sorry, Mother, I didn't catch that; discovered what, where?"" ""A corpse, dear, in his bathtub."" ""What? Wait, we're not done. Please don't disconnect us. Hello! Hello! Is that you, Mother? Hello! Mother! Oh, I apologize, the operator was trying to disconnect us. What kind of corpse?"" ""A dead man, dear, wearing only a pair of pince-nez.""",1
"""The Agony Column was full of cliches - 'Darling Pipsey Come back soon to your distracted Popsey', the typical plea for financial help, and the reminder to 'Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth'. Suddenly, the bell rang. It was the response from Scotland Yard."" Inside was an optician's report, matching the one from Mr. Crimplesham, noting the unusual strength of the lenses and the significant difference in eyesight between the two eyes. ""This is promising,"" Parker remarked.",1
"Inspector Sugg arrived at the scene early Monday morning, finding the girl's behavior suspicious. After suspecting murder, he arrested Mr. Thipps. No signs of forced entry were discovered, but marks on the bathroom window suggested otherwise. The yard, paved with asphalt, showed no signs of a ladder or footprints. The roof was also thoroughly searched, revealing nothing of significance.",1
"""Lady Swaffham called, my lord, to remind you of your lunch appointment with her."" ""I completely forgot, Bunter, and I plan to keep it that way. I hope you informed her that I was indisposed due to sudden illness."" ""Lady Swaffham mentioned meeting the Dowager Duchess of Denver yesterday."" ""If my sister-in-law is attending, count me out,"" Lord Peter declared. ""I apologize, my lord, I meant the Dowager Duchess."" ""What brings her to town?"" ""I believe she is here for the inquest, my lord."" ""Ah, we missed that, Bunter."" ""Indeed, my lord. Her Grace will be joining Lady Swaffham for lunch.""",1
"I regretted having to give up the chance of examining the pauper's brain, but avoiding suspicion was more important. After preparing Levy for dissection, I moved the pauper to the table and brought him back to the house. By now, it was five past eleven, and I assumed the servants were asleep. Maneuvering the body into my bedroom was no easy task, but my experience in the Alps had trained me well in handling such situations.",1
"At the start of spring, Wort, the American ambassador, began hosting a range of events from formal diplomatic dinners with powerful bankers, to casual family get-togethers with close friends. By May, concerns arose about Lady Levy's nerves, leading to ongoing discussions in the following months. Come September, it was reported that ""Freke visited my wife and recommended a complete break and a trip abroad. She's considering traveling with Rachel.""",1
"“Lady Swaffham, I must say, those brides were thoroughly unattractive. But the plan was ingenious the first time around,” Lord Peter remarked, shaking his head. “Murderers these days should strive for a little more originality.” Lady Swaffham gazed at Lord Peter, recalling how Tommy had convinced her to insure her life, leading her to change her routine out of fear.",1
"""So when your son mentioned Duke’s Denver, I didn't hesitate to sign up for the event without waiting for the Bazaar."" ""Thank you for your generosity,"" replied the Duchess. ""Will you be attending the Bazaar as well?"" she asked, looking at him earnestly. ""Absolutely,"" Mr. Milligan responded promptly. ""Lord Peter mentioned that you would confirm the date, but I can always find time to contribute to a good cause. I do hope to take you up on your offer to stay, but if I'm pressed for time, I'll still try to come by to share my thoughts before heading back.""",1
"""Why do they need to? Only Sugg believes so, but his judgment is unreliable. If the man in the bath was truly Levy, then there might be a connection, but we can confirm that it was not him. It's absurd to think that one person could have committed two different crimes on the same night, one in Battersea and the other in Park Lane."" ""I agree,"" Wimsey replied, ""however, we must consider that Levy was indeed in Battersea at the time. Now that we know he didn't return home at midnight as believed, it's possible he never left Battersea.""",1
"He tossed the book across the room, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. ""Confirmation,"" he muttered, as if it made any difference. Collapsing back into his chair, he couldn't shake the memory of a young, anxious boy in blue knickers, standing before a breakfast table at Denver Castle, heart pounding. Address: 282, Harley Street and St. Luke’s House, Prince of Wales Road, Battersea Park, S.W.11. Clubs: White’s; Oxford and Cambridge; Alpine, etc. Interests: Chess, Mountaineering, Fishing.",1
"I assumed that a wise elderly gentleman like Levy would arrange his boots conveniently for his valet, and I should have inferred that he would neatly fold his clothes. That was an error, though not a significant one. Recalling Mr. Bentley's meticulous work, I inspected Levy's mouth for dentures, but found none. Nevertheless, I made sure to dampen his toothbrush. By one o'clock, I rose and clothed myself in my personal garments using the illumination of my trusty pocket flashlight. Fearing to activate the bedroom lamps due to the presence of sheer curtains on the windows, I donned my own footwear along with a worn pair of overshoes outside the room.",1
"‘They have delved so deeply into it’ that, much like Sludge the Medium, they are starting to believe their own fabrications. I would relish the opportunity to probe into some of their minds, Mr. Parker; I could reveal to you the minor flaws and collapses in the neurons, the misfires and disruptions in the nerves, that give rise to these ideas and these novels. At the very least,” he remarked, staring gravely at his visitor, “even if I cannot fully demonstrate it to you today, I will be able to do so tomorrow or in a year’s time or before I pass away.",1
"“Sweating over here trying to spice up your boring investigation with some real excitement, but you couldn’t care less,” Lord Peter exclaimed, frustrated. Inspector Parker remained unmoved. “Let’s not make hasty assumptions,” he replied. Lord Peter scoffed, “Assumptions? You haven’t even started down that road. If you found the cat with its head in the cream-jug, you’d probably argue it’s possible the jug was empty to begin with.” Lord Peter glared at the Inspector, adjusting his monocle. “Hand me the tweezers,” he demanded after a moment.",1
"An’ if you found that the lawyer and the doctor had once upon a time been in business at Poggleton-on-the-Marsh when the Bishop had been vicar there, you’d begin to remember you’d once heard of me payin’ a visit to Poggleton-on-the-Marsh a long time ago, an’ you’d begin to look up the parish registers there an’ discover I’d been married under an assumed name by the vicar to the widow of a wealthy farmer, who’d died suddenly of peritonitis, as certified by the doctor, after the lawyer’d made a will leavin’ me all her money, and then you’d begin to think I might have very good reasons for gettin’ rid of such promisin’ blackmailers as the lawyer, the doctor an’ the bishop.",1
"""I have always been saying that you should have raised the issue with the bath, Alfred,"" she suddenly exclaimed in her characteristic high-pitched, deaf voice. ""Hopefully the landlord will take action now. Although I must say, involving the police may have been unnecessary. But then again, you have always been one to make a big deal out of small things, starting from chicken-pox."" Mr. Thipps interjected apologetically, ""You can see the situation now. It's a good thing she's content with that, as she understands the bathroom is off-limits. However, it has been quite a shock for me, my lord, I mean, sir. My nerves are completely shattered.""",1
"""He chain-smoked unfiltered cigarettes. He had a meticulous grooming routine."" ""Did you search the room thoroughly? I didn't have the opportunity."" ""I didn't discover many footprints. Sugg & Co. had left their mark everywhere, along with little Thipps and the maid, but I observed a vague mark just behind the bathtub, suggesting something wet might have been placed there. It was barely discernible."" ""The rain poured down relentlessly throughout the night.""",1
"""I truly hope so,” the Duchess remarked. “We will need to address the timing, but I cannot make any guarantees.”  “Absolutely,” Mr. Milligan responded enthusiastically. “I understand the intricacies involved in arranging such matters. Furthermore, it is not just me; your son also indicated the involvement of prominent European figures who must be consulted.” The Duchess paled at the prospect of one of these distinguished individuals unexpectedly appearing in someone's parlor. Despite her initial unease, she had settled in and was gradually gaining confidence.",1
"He then dismissed them, with the silent urging to hurry. Sir Julian Freke, after his testimony, caught the Duchess's attention and approached her. ""It's been so long since we last met,"" the Duchess remarked. ""How have you been?"" ""Busy as ever,"" replied the expert. ""Just released my latest novel. These matters are time-consuming. Have you had a chance to visit Lady Levy?"" ""Not yet, unfortunately,"" sighed the Duchess. ""I arrived only this morning, specifically for this occasion. Mrs. Thipps is accompanying me - one of Peter's idiosyncrasies, you know. Poor Christine! I should go check on her.""",1
"Tuesday morning found Lord Peter and a man clad in velveteen, happily making their way through seven acres of turnip fields, tinged yellow by the first frosts of the season. Not far ahead, a subtle ripple of anticipation rustled through the foliage, signaling the imminent arrival of one of the Duke of Denver's prized setter puppies. Suddenly, a partridge burst into the air with a sound reminiscent of a police rattle, prompting Lord Peter to react swiftly and skillfully - a remarkable feat considering his recent nights spent eavesdropping on fictional German saboteurs.",1
"""I can't stress enough how crucial it is."" ""Under no circumstances, sir. It would jeopardize everything."" ""The pants are fine, Bunter."" ""Not for Lady Swaffham's, sir. And let's not forget the incident at Salisbury."" Mr. Bunter pointed out a grease stain on the light cloth. ""I regret ever allowing you to become a trusted family servant, Bunter,"" Lord Peter said, angrily, tossing his walking-stick into the umbrella-stand. ""You have no idea the errors my mother might be making.""",1
"He took a risk and emerged victorious. After ascending the stairs, he stripped down, meticulously cleaning his teeth but avoiding the hairbrush to prevent leaving behind incriminating evidence. His conjecture about Levy's belongings proved to be half accurate. To stage the scene, he slipped into the victim's pajamas and settled into the bed. In the eerie stillness of the early morning, he changed back into his own attire from a concealed bag and stealthily made his way downstairs.",1
"As the doctor prepared the injection, Lord Peter felt a sense of unease creeping over him. He watched intently as Sir Julian Freke carefully sterilized the area before administering the mysterious substance. Lord Peter couldn't help but wonder what exactly was being injected into his body.",1
"When the Stock Exchange opened, I immediately contacted my brokers to sell off most of my Peruvian stock at a profit. However, later in the day, buyer confidence wavered due to Levy's death, resulting in only a small gain from the transaction. I hope I have clarified any confusion and congratulate you on outsmarting me. Best wishes to your mother. Sincerely, JULIAN FREKE PS: My will is finalized, with my money going to St.",1
"""Perhaps one day you yourself will find the need for my services, you never can tell. When someone starts blackmailing you, Gerald, or your first ex-wife shows up unexpectedly from the West Indies, you'll understand the value of having a family private investigator.

""When do you need the car?"" ""Soon. By the way, Jerry, I'm bringing Mother along."" ""Why involve her?"" ""I need her assistance.""",1
"I wore an overcoat similar to Levy’s, and made sure to bring along an opera hat. I prayed he wouldn't realize I didn't have an umbrella this time. Luckily, the rain had eased to a light drizzle, and he seemed oblivious to the missing item. Instructing him to halt at 50 Overstrand Mansions, I settled the fare and waited under the entrance until he departed. Rushing to my side entrance, I unlocked the door and entered. It was nearing two o'clock, and the most challenging part of my mission awaited.",1
"""Listen, my friend,"" he interjected abruptly, just as Parker was seeing him off, ""have you considered that Freke's account contradicts Anderson's claim that the old man was in such high spirits at dinner on Monday evening? How would you react in such a situation?"" ""Not positively,"" replied Parker; however, he proceeded cautiously, ""but some individuals do engage in banter even in the dentist's waiting area. Yourself included."" ""Indeed,"" acknowledged Lord Peter before heading downstairs. Upon his arrival home at midnight, Lord Peter was surprisingly wide awake and vigilant.",1
"""Are you certain he didn’t take a second pair?” “His associate confirms that he possessed only two pairs, one of which was discovered on his dressing-table, and the other in the drawer where it is always placed.” Lord Peter let out a low whistle. “You’ve outsmarted me there, Parker. Even if he had left to end his own life, he would have taken those with him.” “That seems logical, or the suicide would have occurred as soon as he stepped onto the road. Nevertheless, I did consider that scenario. I have gathered details of all accidents on the streets today, and I can confidently say that none of them involved Sir Reuben.”",1
"""Dr. Colegrove, a skilled surgeon, used to be at Guy’s. Gave it up long ago. Always good to stay sharp. Now, Lady Levy, please take a look at this scar. Be firm, take your time.

That little kink, I know it well.""",1
"""Ah, my dear friend,"" he whispered with a hint of sentiment, ""you bring back memories of my childhood, the importance of humor: ""There once was a man of great wit Who thought he could outsmart a misfit, But they laughed in his face With no trace of grace So they taught that man quite a lesson. You see, Parker, that's the key. A man disappears, a joke is left behind, and suddenly it's all a bit amusing. Honestly, Parker, I'm not too concerned about this case anymore."" ""Which one, this or yours?"" ""Both.""",1
"""Oh, these self-made men of low origin don’t think much about teeth, and are terrified of dentists. True; but one of the molars has a broken edge so rough that it had made a sore place on the tongue. Nothing’s more painful. D’you mean to tell me a man would put up with that if he could afford to get the tooth filed? Well, people are queer. I’ve known servants endure agonies rather than step over a dentist’s doormat. How did you see that, Wimsey? Had a look inside; electric torch,"" remarked Lord Peter.",1
"Parker nodded in understanding as Sir Julian recounted the events of the fateful Monday night. Sir Reuben Levy's visit had been shrouded in secrecy, his health a cause for concern. Seeking a second opinion, he had turned to Sir Julian, hoping to keep his worries hidden from his wife. The weight of the situation hung heavy in the air as they discussed the delicate matter, a web of secrets and suspicions slowly unraveling before them.",1
"I must acknowledge the exceptional quality of your lordship’s wine collection, as I experienced no negative effects after consuming a considerable amount of both the Cockburn ’68 and the 1800 Napoleon.

Lord Peter pondered to himself, “I suspect Mervyn Bunter might be joking with me. What is it, Soames?” “A telegram, my lord.”",1
"""Furthermore, why the number three? Cummings did not encounter him until he summoned him for breakfast at eight o’clock.” “Yet, he was seen taking a bath at three.” “I am not denying that he could have returned from Park Lane before three. However, I highly doubt Cummings would have peered through the bathroom keyhole to confirm his presence in the bath.” Parker pondered once more. “What about Crimplesham’s pince-nez?” he inquired. “That is quite perplexing,” Lord Peter remarked. “And what about Thipps’s bathroom?” “An intriguing question. It could be a coincidence, or it could be intentional mischief.” “Do you believe that such a sophisticated plan could have been devised overnight, Wimsey?” “Not at all. It was concocted as soon as that individual who bore a passing resemblance to Levy entered the workhouse.”",1
"Lord Peter nonchalantly picked up the receiver, greeting it like an old friend. “Hello, Mother,” he said casually. The Dowager Duchess responded, “Oh, there you are, dear. I thought I had just missed you.” Lord Peter explained, “Yes, I had just left for Brocklebury’s sale, but had to come back for the catalogue.

""Mr. Wingate, please bring that lamp over here,"" he instructed, as Mr. Levett carefully navigated around the flex. The bright circle of light illuminated the table, revealing Dr. Grimbold's beard and spectacles, Mr. Levett blowing his nose, Parker leaning in, and the Master of the Workhouse looking on intently.",1
"Riding towards the market place on the wrong side of the road, I spotted a young woman in her early twenties with dark hair and brown eyes.

"In a classic detective novel, there would have been a timely shower an hour before the crime and distinct marks indicating the time of the incident. However, in the gritty reality of a London November, expecting such luck is as futile as finding footprints in Niagara Falls. After scouring the rooftops, it became clear that any resident in the row of flats could have been the culprit. With staircases leading directly to the flat roofs and the flat leads making for easy navigation, the possibilities were endless. Yet, there was undeniable evidence that the victim had indeed traversed those very rooftops.",1
"Lord Peter stood on the hearthrug, a smile on his face as he looked down at his guest. The young man expressed his frustration with the questions asked during examinations, to which Lord Peter responded with curiosity about Tommy Pringle. The young man was surprised by Lord Peter's knowledge, prompting a discussion about how he knew Tommy Pringle would be involved.",1
"The Duke glanced at him skeptically. ""I trust you won't make the mistake of marrying a chorus girl,"" he thought to himself, before going back to reading the Times. Throughout dinner, I made an effort to uncover Cummings's preferences, which seemed to lean towards music-hall entertainment. Taking advantage of your lordship's generosity in providing me with tickets to all London shows, I engaged him in conversation about this particular interest, speaking with more candor than usual to ensure his enjoyment.",1
"""And when it comes to short stories,"" Lord Peter remarked, ""it's essential to present information in a concise statement format. Otherwise, the dialogue would drag on endlessly, testing the reader's patience. Writers must always keep their audience in mind, assuming there is one."" Mr. Piggott nodded in agreement, adding, ""It's true that recalling details can be quite challenging for most individuals, even when prompted with questions. I, for one, struggle with it, though I admit to my own foolishness. But then again, aren't we all a bit foolish in the end? Witnesses, after all, are not detectives; they are just ordinary folks like you and me.""",1
"""He had casually strolled into his bedroom, swiftly swapping his attire in a manner that contradicted his usual slow movements. Choosing a deep-blue tie to complement his socks, he deftly knotted it without a pause or a hint of tension in his expression. His black shoes were replaced with brown ones, a monocle placed in his breast pocket, and a stunning ebony walking stick with a gleaming silver top was in his grasp. 'I believe that's everything,' he muttered under his breath. 'Well, perhaps I should bring you along as well. One can never predict when you might be of use.'""",1
"At the corner, there is a marking labeled F, but it can be ignored; it's just a residue left behind by the youth who passed it to me. The youth had just removed a piece of chewing-gum from his teeth with his finger before informing me about Mr. Milligan's availability. The thumbprints D and E belong to Mr. Milligan and his red-haired secretary. Though I'm unsure which belongs to whom, I did witness the youth handing the card to the secretary. Later, I observed John P. Milligan holding the card in his hand, so it doesn't matter for now who the thumbprints belong to.",1
"“Did trying to solve the problem have any negative physical effects?” “None.” “You were interested, but not upset.” “Exactly.” “You have worked on similar investigations before?” “Yes. Small ones.” “Did they have a negative impact on your health?” “Not at all. In fact, they were a welcome distraction. I had a rough time after the war, which didn’t help matters, you know.” “Ah! Are you married?” “No.” “May I examine you? Please move closer to the light. I need to see your eyes. Whose guidance have you sought thus far?” “Sir James Hodges’.”",1
"She was terrified at the thought that she might have forgotten to lock the window on Monday night, even though she would rather have lost her head than be so absent-minded. Witness broke down in tears and was handed a glass of water, while the Coroner helped himself to a third lozenge. Composing herself, witness confirmed that she had thoroughly checked all the rooms before retiring for the night. Absolutely not, there was no way a body could have been concealed in the apartment without her noticing. She had been in the kitchen all evening, and there was barely enough space for the finest dinner set, let alone a body.",1
"""At least he didn't forget to clean his teeth and put his boots out. That's something, I suppose,"" Lord Peter remarked. Bunter, always the observant one, added, ""It is peculiar that he didn't fold his clothes, yet managed to remember those details. People tend to overlook such small things, my lord.""",1
"I get furious when someone challenges my opinion on a novel. Levy, a person who was once insignificant, swoops in and steals Freke's woman right in front of him. It's not the woman that bothers Freke, but the fact that his prestigious reputation is threatened by someone he considers beneath him. Additionally, Freke has a fascination with crime. In his criminology publication, he takes pleasure in discussing a ruthless killer. When he talks about a heartless and accomplished criminal, his admiration shines through the text. He saves his disdain for the victims, the repentant, or those who make mistakes and get caught.",1
"Yet, the man had vanished from society seamlessly, leaving no trace behind. Trying to uncover a motive for the murder of a person with no connections or history is akin to grasping the fourth dimension - a challenging and inconclusive task. Even if further investigation were to reveal dark secrets in Mr. X's background.",1
"Lord Peter stopped in his tracks. ""Hold on a moment,"" he interjected. ""I just had an idea. If Sugg is present, he's bound to cause trouble. I need to outsmart him."" Without hesitation, he dashed back, while his companions hailed a passing taxi. Inspector Sugg and his assistant Cerberus were stationed at 59, Queen Caroline Mansions, and were not eager to entertain any unofficial visitors. Parker managed to slip through their defenses, but Lord Peter faced a cold reception and what was later dubbed as a deliberate lack of action. Despite his protests of being hired by Mrs. Thipps to help her son, Lord Peter was met with resistance.",1
"Lord Peter mentioned the possibility of Levy going to see Freke on Monday night, to which Parker unexpectedly confirmed. They discussed the mysterious nature of their cases, with every lead seeming to reach a dead end. Parker mentioned losing another lead while questioning Levy's secretary about his business.",1
"At the corner, Lady Swaffham politely pardoned the offender. ""Your mother is present,"" she mentioned. ""Hello, Mother,"" Lord Peter greeted nervously. ""How are you, my dear?"" responded the Duchess. ""You shouldn't have arrived so soon. Mr. Milligan was about to share his exciting speech for the Bazaar with me when you interrupted us."" The topic of conversation during lunch shifted to the Battersea inquest, with the Duchess vividly portraying Mrs. Thipps' interrogation by the Coroner.",1
"""I'm embarrassed,"" ""That's fine,"" Parker said with a grin. ""Take your time."" He helped Freke get into the cab. ""What address? 24 Russell Square, driver, and step on it."" The cab sped away. Parker went back up the stairs and rang Lord Peter's doorbell. ""Thanks, my friend,"" he remarked. ""I'll stay the night, after all."" ""Come on in,"" Wimsey replied. ""Did you witness that?"" Parker inquired. ""I caught a glimpse. What exactly transpired?"" Parker recounted his tale. ""Honestly,"" he admitted, ""I've questioned your sanity, but now I'm not so certain."" Peter chuckled.",1
"“What do you think has happened to the old man?” “I have no idea,” replied the Honourable Freddy; “perhaps attacked by wild animals, I imagine.” “Maybe he’s leading a double life,” Lord Peter suggested. “Some of these City men are quite unpredictable.” “No, no,” the Honourable Freddy objected, somewhat more alert now; “Wimsey, I can’t agree with that. He’s a respectable man, and his daughter is lovely. And he may outsmart you, but he won’t betray you. Old Anderson is very upset about this.” “Who’s Anderson?” “A man who owns property in that area.",1
"""Such a dreadful place, the City, isn’t it? Everybody Ishmaels together though I don’t suppose Sir Reuben would like to be called that, would he? Doesn’t it mean illegitimate, or not a proper Jew, anyway? I always did get confused with those Old Testament characters.” Lord Peter laughed and yawned. “I think I’ll turn in for an hour or two,” he said. “I must be back in town at eight Parker’s coming to breakfast.” The Duchess looked at the clock, which marked five minutes to three. “I’ll send up your breakfast at half-past six, dear,” she said. “I hope you’ll find everything all right.",1
"He believes Mr. Thipps concealed the body in the box-room or elsewhere, so he thoroughly searched all possible places for signs of occupation. If the signs had been there, he would have found them. Since he didn’t find any, it’s safe to say they weren’t there. Parker, convinced, urged to move on and detail the medical evidence.",1
