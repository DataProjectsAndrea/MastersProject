"Should I mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. “Mrs. Blair, for one,” I said lightly. “A friend of mine with whom I am staying.” “I think not,” said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. “You have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.” His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed, but I was not going to give in without a fight. “You are very clever,” I said. “Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone? Mrs.",0
"To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera. All Carton’s effects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his state of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind. That was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why should he be carrying a roll of films? I set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be developed. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of each film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my roll.",0
“He’s been with me eight years a most trustworthy fellow.” My interlocutor smiled. “We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.” “Miss Pettigrew?” I exclaimed. “Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop.” “God bless my soul!” I interrupted. “I was going into that place myself this afternoon. You might have caught me coming out!” There doesn’t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in Jo’burg without being suspected for it. “Ah! but she has been there more than once and in rather doubtful circumstances.,0
"Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr.",0
"""By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why ” I began. “No ‘whys,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.",0
"“Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain.",0
"My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I can’t resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it gives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn’t quite as clever as he thought himself, was he? I think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I’m sending you my diary. There’s nothing in it that would interest Race and his crowd, but I fancy that there are passages in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for the Daily Budget, “Criminals I have met.” I only stipulate that I shall be the central figure.",0
"Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly.",0
"“Say you’re sorry about my sister ” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have.",0
"“So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.",0
"Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.” “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr.",0
"It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter.",0
"“There will be no objection to my er calling in this gentleman, I suppose?” “None at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. “Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just let us have the facts?” Mrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her chair. “Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself.” Thus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began. “I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room as usual” “Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mr. Opalsen explained.",0
"It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot.",0
"A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown” was returned, and the police (and the Daily Budget_) were left to look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out.",0
"""That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least ” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M.",0
"” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas. And if some little fact will not fit in do not reject it but consider it closely.",0
"A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.” “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?” “My dear sir, I never attended him.” “What?” “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist or something of that kind.” “But you examined the body?” “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.” “And the cause of death was clear?” “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.” “Was he still lying where he had been found?” “Yes, the body had not been touched.",0
"We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.” By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal. “Vite, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!” Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.",0
"The curtains and portière were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward, passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, mon ami! And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief.",0
"Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize ” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully. “All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study.",0
"30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!” “Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?” Japp winked. “I think it grew pretty fast grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that we’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I’m sorry Mrs.",0
"I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner. He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets.",0
"Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him.",0
"It’s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There’s to be money in it ” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.",0
"""He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.” “But no notecase.” “Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.” I tried another tack. “You don’t think it’s odd that the doctor never came forward afterwards?” “A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers. He probably forgot all about the accident.” “In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I said sweetly. “Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know fond of mysteries and such-like. But as I’m a busy man” I took the hint and rose.",0
"I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, mon ami.” “You are going to Paris? But why?” He replied very seriously. “To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.” “You think he is in Paris?” “I am quite certain that he is not.",0
"My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings.",0
"With a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted. “Quick in here.” Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so. “And you behind the curtain.” “Si, signor,” said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window. Not a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form. “Where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance.",0
"What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It looks as though he had some hold over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested in spite of myself. “You don’t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he’s a most capable and hard-working young man.",0
"On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven. “I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr. Vavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.",0
"“Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the Daily Budget.” “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. “I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully.",0
"Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.",0
"I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean the opposite?” “Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.” “Brachycephalic,” I murmured unwillingly. “That’s it. I thought that was what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said with all the assurance I could muster. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she laughed. “You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.",0
"s.” “Eh bien?” “Well, they started from Boulogne but they never arrived.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.” “And the bogus car?” “Is still at large.” Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?” “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed.",0
"The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable.",0
"The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken since you were in Florence at the time. And yet” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where er where” “ did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow.",0
"And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa.",0
"She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room God! It was horrible. Dead and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in.",0
"All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil, subtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing I were the next? “Mon Dieu,” said Poirot, in a very low voice, “I do not understand this. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?” “I believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.” “Ah, of course, you are not the doctor.” “My name is Tosswill.” This, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as being a minor official at the British Museum. There was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy. “If you will come with me,” continued Dr.",0
"""The matter on which you want to consult him is serious?” “My God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was foully murdered last night.” “Here in London?” “No, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to come round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.” “If you will excuse me a minute,” I said, struck by a sudden idea. I rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with the situation. He took any further words out of my mouth. “I see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not? You should know my methods by now.",0
"I dare say it’s only a silly hoax Gregory says so but it’s just worrying me to death.” She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement. “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.” “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot. The latter scrutinized them closely. “Cheap paper the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure. I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.",0
"I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.",0
"Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real rent of those flats is £350. I have just ascertained that from the landlord’s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds! Why?” “There must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as Mrs. Robinson suggested.” Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “Then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!” “But surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.",0
"Having parted with mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the interview had taken place in a house in St. John’s Wood) and across Hyde Park to St. George’s Hospital. There I entered Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road. Once on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring mind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really were points and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased to find I was right.",0
"In the meantime the fighting goes on.” “I wish,” I said, “that one could be sure that the right people were the ones to get killed. I mean the ones who wanted to fight not just all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the fighting is going on.” He nodded. “I know what you mean, Anne. That’s the unfairness of war. But I’ve other news for you.” “Yes?” “A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to escape.” “What?” “Yes. No one knows how he managed it.",0
"“But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?” “He’s ill in bed with influenza.” “Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?” And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr.",0
"He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred.",0
"“Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right.",0
"“I don’t know.” “In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am not dead yet!’ To which you responded: ‘I wish you were!’” The boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him. “I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply. With an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor. “What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with my father. I dare say I said all those things I was so angry I cannot even remember what I said! I was furious I could almost have killed him at that moment there, make the most of that!” He leant back in his chair, flushed and defiant.",0
"The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson’s feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn’t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: “Don’t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him.",0
"She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace’s whole life was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had an acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina removed certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the state of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute fears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina, she was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of questionable things in order to get rich, but women shouldn’t pretend to be in love when they aren’t for ulterior motives. I can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive Nadina.",0
"Hastings, there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can happen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘I am a leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.” “What?” I ejaculated. “It was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the South Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough.",0
"A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.",0
"No, I swore to myself that I’d take better care of you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this island. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come and look after you. She’s loyal. She’ll never say a word. I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know.” I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know! How some words please one! “You did quite right,” I said quietly. “And I shall not send word to any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn’t make much difference. It’s not as though they were my own people.",0
"The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and the political schemes all the stories current were traced back to the lady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the “Crown jewels” the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his wife.",0
"Young Bleibner, some years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular will, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.",0
"“Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady, richly dressed fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming along slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl, gesticulating as he does so.",0
"“Chéri,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.” “Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack I am afraid.” I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man’s arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers.",0
"Hautet doubtfully. “But it is possibly a little unfair on his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If she were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.” “It may be as you say. Now, M.",0
"I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling.",0
"He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never seemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every important society, and had rows of letters after his name, the general public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned books, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge, had no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee.",0
"“I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?” “Mon ami I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering Léonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I decided on the latter. So I made my guess and I was right.” “And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?” Poirot smiled. “At any rate I saw that she had anxious eyes.",0
"” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. I could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. For he must have loved her once he must he must to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me.",0
"No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",0
"Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight hours and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes a faint scratching sound came to my ears. Poirot’s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there. Poirot placed his lips to my ear. “Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast. Be careful, he will have a knife.” Presently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light appeared through the door.",0
"Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, la pauvre dame! She will eat nothing but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, par exemple, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur.",0
"If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife.",0
"They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: “But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear now?” And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. “I am afraid for you.",0
"If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps going out of my life. I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours.",0
"Tosswill, “I will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive.” We were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,” said Tosswill. The youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother.",0
"I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can.",0
"“Not the poison of the Borgias,” replied Poirot, with a twinkle. “I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk.” “French chalk?” “Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.” I laughed. “You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something exciting.” “Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!” The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush. The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.",0
"But, my God! what’s going to happen about Bella?” “If I were you,” said Poirot frankly, “I should not distress myself unduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the crime passionnel. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you ” “I don’t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I do feel guilty of my father’s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this girl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat.",0
"Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with three people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.",0
"“Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered.",0
"I had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor. The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven. The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a cupboard.",0
"""They say,” I said slowly, “that you are really connected with the Government that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road.",0
"Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself! I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise. “A la bonne heure, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.” “You are called away on a case, then?” “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr.",0
"It demolishes my theory it ruins everything it ah, no!” He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest. “It is impossible. I cannot be wrong! The facts, taken methodically and in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I must be right! I am right!” “But then ” He interrupted me. “Wait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is impossible unless unless oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word ” He was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he said in a quiet assured voice: “The victim is a man of middle-age.",0
"It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s.",0
"But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road” “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot. “Yes but how did you know?” “Oh, c’est évident! Continue!” “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur” “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is really a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of Pagett’s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn’t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived by Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch. He never worried me or got in my way. Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us can move without falling over it. I went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my appearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were listening spellbound to one of Race’s travellers’ tales.",0
"""Come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of details as clues?” “By no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger is they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant; one or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells” he tapped his forehead “on which one must rely. The senses mislead. One must seek the truth within not without.” “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?” “That is exactly what I do mean granted the facts were placed before me.",0
"A woman nearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may be deceived!” “Billy Kellett? But he’s known to the police!” “Did I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his alibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn he was creating the character of Billy Kellett, ‘doing three months,’ so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came. He was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty. It was worth while doing the thing thoroughly.",0
"le juge.” “You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this attachment, madame.",0
"If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order.",0
"“Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?” “You consider him a rich man, doctor?” The doctor looked rather surprised. “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.” “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly. The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly. “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe.",0
"” The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor the case is like this. There must be no reservations. You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might enfin!” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs.",0
"” Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: “We thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson she’s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too came hurrying down the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said. ‘But it’s no good. It’s already let.’ That seemed to finish it, but well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium.",0
"""I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that leads us?” “Where we were when we started.” “Jamais de la vie! If the package was thrown overboard, and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in London.” “Yes, but then” Poirot waved an impatient hand. “Permit me to continue.",0
"How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death.",0
"At last Lady Yardly rose. “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.” She hesitated, her hand outstretched. “Captain Hastings.” “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.” When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.",0
"I am convinced that the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if you will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several years of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee.",0
"There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph. “According to plan,” he said softly. “You amateurs will pit yourselves against professionals.” “What’s the meaning of this?” cried Harry hoarsely. “It means that you have walked into my parlour said the spider to the fly,” remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. “My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.” “You said I could come safely, Anne?” “Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself.",0
"You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife wicked little thing! that Jack had given Bella! Ten to one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress.",0
"I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.” “There has been a second attempt, then?” “Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has disappeared.” “What?” “He has been kidnapped!” “Impossible!” I cried, stupefied. Poirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut. “Unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,” continued his lordship. Poirot looked at Mr. Dodge. “You said just now, monsieur, that time was everything.",0
"She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs” “But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected. “I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!” “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity.",0
"The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her. But she was checkmated not by Hercule Poirot but by la petite acrobate with her wrists of steel.” I mused over the whole story. “When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?” Poirot smiled.",0
"""Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.” “He was supposed to be in Florence but he certainly never went there. I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved.",0
"""Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then in the hotel at Kimberley we met her” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task.",0
"The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind. Was it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was prejudiced the Tube incident was my own pet mystery but there certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the two fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face evidently an Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me to what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland Yard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of the Mill House case.",0
"By the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no sign of my quarry. I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it. It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: "". 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any importance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure.",0
"""Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain.",0
"It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer.",0
"""You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines.",0
"She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow.",0
"“Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M. Jack Renauld.” “What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?” “Giraud.” “Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will he will ” She broke off. There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently.",0
"Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!” (Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!) “Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?” “Yes, their name is Baker.” The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us.",0
"A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last.",0
"… “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before. If it was not Bella Duveen, the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one single proof against her! “And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea since, as she thought, it belonged to her sister.",0
"“I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said, in a low voice. “It’s been in the family so long.” She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her shoulders. “I must go and dress. I suppose I had better display ‘the goods.’” She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. “It’s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George has always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never been done.” She left the room. Half an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady.",0
"I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms heavily paid for to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt.",0
"The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid a master stroke, ça!” “But what did you go to London for?” “You remember the card?” “Certainly. It puzzled me and puzzles me still. I thought” I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. “Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints.",0
"I saw the face for the first time the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face. “Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any chance?” As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.",0
"We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it.",0
"So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but ” She interrupted me. “Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all ” “It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know what he said?” “No?” “‘Hell!’ said the Prince and kissed her!” And I suited the action to the word. I was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on the street below. “That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath. “What is, mon ami?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of his comfortable chair.",0
"We were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s announcement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up from the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and announced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28. I looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to the station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost importance that he should know at once of the new and startling developments in the case. Evidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he wanted in Paris.",0
"“Did you see Sir Eustace?” I asked. “He was marching out of the breakfast room as we went in. He’d had some bad fish or something and was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and he bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was only it wasn’t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.” Suzanne smiled. “Sir Eustace doesn’t like getting up early any more than I do. But, Anne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage. He’s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?” “Only trying to push me overboard,” I replied nonchalantly. It was a distinct score for me.",0
"…” I did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There appeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least of it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me with a finger to its lips. It was Giraud. Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. “What were you doing there?” I asked. “Exactly what you were doing listening.” “But I was not there on purpose!” “Ah!” said Giraud.",0
"” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did not confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak, don’t we?” I admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language.",0
"“But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced.",0
"We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. “Alias the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there was something more behind. “You haven’t caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.",0
"Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! mon Dieu! What else could it be?” “Blackmail,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor.",0
"And think of me sometimes, comfortably putting on weight amidst the fleshpots! Your loving friend, Suzanne Blair. P.S. I am sending you an assortment of frying-pans as a wedding present, and an enormous terrine of pâté de foie gras to remind you of me. There is another letter that I sometimes read. It came a good while after the other and was accompanied by a bulky packet. It appeared to be written from somewhere in Bolivia.",0
"The tears streaming down her face, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. She admitted that, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime but, before God, nothing more! She knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to the law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.",0
"” For answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket an ancient tattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans. Then, wheeling round, he strode out of the tent. The doctor stared at me. “What is his little idea?” The phrase, so familiar on Poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came from another. “I don’t know exactly,” I confessed. “He’s got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.” I went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced young man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner’s secretary. “No,” Mr.",0
"” I endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of the case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that of Giraud which Poirot despised. I reflected anew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case. Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there I must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up my hypothesis.",0
"Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain. On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?” “Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one of your efforts of fancy.” “It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears.",0
"“His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily.",0
"He was a man who once loved me.” “In South Africa?” asked the Count negligently. “Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.” “That is your native country, is it not?” She nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. “Well,” he remarked, “you know your own business best, but, if I were you, I should fear the ‘Colonel’ far more than any disillusioned lover. He is a man whom it is particularly easy to underestimate.” She laughed scornfully. “As if I did not know him after all these years!” “I wonder if you do?” he said softly. “I very much wonder if you do.",0
"The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “Eh bien, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.",0
"” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if ” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so.",0
"At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot: “Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.” Dumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath. “He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something in it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don’t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up right away, and take another look at her.” But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind.",0
"“Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly.",0
"Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island.",0
"I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind.",0
"You accompany me, n’est-ce pas?” “Well ” “You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.” “Oh, that’s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.” “Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the name?” “There’s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name’s Renauld. I don’t know whether it could be the same.” “But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is in Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress finely.” “Dear me, Poirot,” I said, my excitement rising, “I smell some goodly shekels in this.",0
"In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots in the other, none! You see? Some one had passed that way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.” “Where did they get a rake?” “Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot impatiently. “There is no difficulty about that.” “What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, mon ami.",0
"With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot. The result had been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The “Mary” hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming’s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently disarming effect. Mr. Flemming was nervous too.",0
"But au fond, he is very business-like, ce monsieur! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone.",0
"de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow.",0
"“There’s something very queer about all this,” he said. “To begin with, where is Rayburn?” It’s perfectly true that we haven’t seen the fellow since we came on shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however. Altogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter. I can’t take him about with me in his present condition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray’s billet-doux, but I shall not take Pagett with me.",0
"In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg.",0
"As it was, she positively bridled. “I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The Daily Budget’s out still to catch the man who did it. It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope they’ll get him although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him ah, well, I dare say he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad they’re a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman. Stood there where you’re standing now.",0
"” Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler’s diary, of which he has kindly begged me to make use. So here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures. I’d always longed for adventures. You see, my life had such a dreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England’s greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really was a genius every one admits that. His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic times, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body inhabited the modern world.",0
"Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot.",0
"“Miss Beddingfeld, you may not know it, but you are mixed up in a rather dangerous business.” “I gathered as much,” I said. “No, you don’t. You can’t possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave the whole thing alone. It can’t concern you really. Don’t let your curiosity lead you to tamper with other people’s business. No, please don’t get angry again. I’m not speaking of myself. You’ve no idea of what you might come up against these men will stop at nothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you’re in danger look at last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is to persuade them that they’re mistaken.",0
"Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech atWhat’s the matter? Why aren’t you taking it down?” “I think,” said Colonel Race gently, “that Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.",0
"In the corner, to the right of the fire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man or what had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the telephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the base of it stained with blood. The doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “Stone dead. Must have been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to telephone. It will be better not to move him until the police arrive.” On the manager’s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result was a foregone conclusion.",0
"Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.” “Very clever,” interpolated the Count approvingly. “The ‘Colonel’ is always clever. Well, I did my part but I also did one thing which the ‘Colonel’ had not foreseen. I kept back some of the South American stones one or two are unique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beer’s hands. With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter is bound to be suspected.",0
"English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.",0
"Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating. “I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took the path to the bridge. I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge.",0
"Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.” “Who is his uncle?” “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.” “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?” “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds.",0
"""Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?” Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned. Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand. “Again, if you please, mademoiselle.” At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket. “Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,” he bowed to the inspector “for your courtesy.",0
"But the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirot’s voice rose in mild reproof. “Never will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would I permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, mon ami.” This to the Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof: “See now, what I have done for you. I have saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our beautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and front. Straight into the arms of the police they will go.",0
"“Order” and “Method” were his gods. He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: “The true work, it is done from within.",0
"“You understand, don’t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.” He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. “I understand,” I said gratefully. “And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.” “No, of course not.” “You know his real name?” The question surprised me. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar.",0
"“Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?” “You wouldn’t like it if they did,” I assured her. “To tell you the truth, I’m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as I was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.” Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. “And what are we all doing now?” she asked. “I don’t quite know,” I said thoughtfully.",0
"It was just as dusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three days that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any length of time, it would have been thickly coated. Who had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films. I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously.",0
"le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “Eh bien! Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.” “Ah, par exemple,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.",0
"” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem.",0
"To la femme sentiment is everything is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact.” “Of course, of course,” said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. “Still” He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers. With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman. “Oh, oh, my necklace!” She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round. “Where was it?” demanded Opalsen. “Maid’s bed.",0
"""So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.",0
"Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house.",0
"“If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain.",0
"I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service.",0
"22. The thing I don’t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer instinct.” “And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?” “My dear Anne, you don’t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar.",0
"“Please ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,” said Willard. “We are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters, but it isn’t it can’t be, anything but coincidence.” There was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly. “Your heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?” “Rather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is going on. Make up your mind to that.” Poirot wheeled round on the other. “What have you to say to that, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” drawled the doctor, “I’m not for quitting myself.” Poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.",0
"Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.",0
"“Now, what about Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that evening?” “Well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen is a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been able once or twice to score a coup off Davenheim in the market, though it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter concerning some South American shares which led the banker to make his appointment.” “Had Davenheim interests in South America, then?” “I believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in Buenos Ayres.",0
"""Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door. Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen. “This necklace it was, without doubt, insured?” Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question. “Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.” “But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.” “I comprehend, madame,” said Poirot soothingly. “I comprehend perfectly.",0
"Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.",0
"“I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.” “Has he any relatives in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.” “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?” “That point has not been overlooked.",0
"“Now then, stand back there, will you? What’s the sense in crowding round.” A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I must get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up, another having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so, he dropped a piece of paper. I stopped, picked it up, and ran after him. But the lift gates clanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand.",0
"“But there’s a gentleman about who’s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies’ cabins and frighten them.” “How dreadful,” I said, looking alarmed. “He won’t come in here, will he?” “Oh, I don’t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.” “Good night.” I opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight. Drunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents had been wasted.",0
"When he had finished, she drew a long breath. “But you are wonderful magnificent! You are the greatest detective in the world.” With a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French. “Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so. Oh, save him, save him save him!” We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us.",0
"“Won’t you just stay and have something to eat?” We accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs. We had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the door, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The parlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart. “It was a man standing in the passage.” Poirot rushed out, returning quickly. “There is no one there.” “Isn’t there, sir?” said the parlourmaid weakly. “Oh, it did give me a start!” “But why?” She dropped her voice to a whisper.",0
"Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well it sounds snobbish perhaps but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class.",0
"A moment later he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld. “Here is Madame.” Giraud came forward with a curt bow. “This way, madame.” He led her across, and then, standing suddenly aside. “Here is the man. Do you know him?” And as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to read her mind, noting every indication of her manner. But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm too calm, I felt. She looked down at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life.",0
"He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate.",0
"It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.",0
"The House of Commons is bad enough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight restriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly before leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman with a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle in Alice in Wonderland. He dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy fashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further efforts by ejaculating something that sounded like “Platt Skeet,” uttered fortissimo and in marked contrast to the rest of his delivery.",0
"Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester.",0
"The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr. er Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely.",0
"Then, his face lightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the dead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was but how did you know?” “By this. I found it on the back of the leather chair.",0
"The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible. Nobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them. Angrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted. I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot, neat and smiling, sitting beside the bed. “Enfin you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings! Do you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?” I groaned and put a hand to my head. “I must have been dreaming,” I said.",0
"Dressed precisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel. “And my boots,” he wailed. “Regard them, Hastings. My boots, of the neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the sand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which outrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to become limp but limp!” “Look at the Sphinx,” I urged. “Even I can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales.” Poirot looked at it discontentedly. “It has not the air happy,” he declared. “How could it, half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion.",0
"“They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look. “On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?” “Very curious,” I agreed. “And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.",0
"I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions.",0
"All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then.",0
"I had been madly in love with her for the moment I even think that I frightened her sometimes but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead.",0
"Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.",0
"""I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely it. Too much so perhaps. Was he or was he not just a little like a stage clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly.",0
"“I thought I thought it was the master it looked like ’im.” I saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it too, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirot’s arm with a scream. “Didn’t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? That’s how he always used to tap when he passed round the house.” “The ivy,” I cried. “It was the ivy against the pane.” But a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was obviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers besought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be left alone. We sat in the little morning-room.",0
"Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.",0
"The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal blood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination. It was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy’s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the outskirts of Lyons.",0
"Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London was uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, mon ami. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler.",0
"All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me little better than a limp rag. I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious of some barrier between us a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing.",0
"“Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course.",0
"I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help.",0
"At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it.",0
"To most people it would have been a treat but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a nice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on.",0
"Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.” I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly: “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!” I looked at him coldly. On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress.",0
"In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me.",0
"""Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.",0
"“My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up.",0
"With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent omelette, and an equally excellent entrecôte to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length café noir had completed the meal.",0
"“It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows.",0
"Engine going round a curve.’” “You could write that under any snapshot of a train,” I said. Women never think of these simple things. “I’m glad we’ve come up here in daylight,” cried Anne Beddingfeld. “I shouldn’t have seen this if I’d gone last night to Durban, should I?” “No,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “You’d have waked up to-morrow morning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of stones and rocks.” “I’m glad I changed my mind,” said Anne, sighing contentedly, and looking round. It was rather a wonderful sight.",0
"Poirot was very sorry for the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance Company, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said gently to Mrs. Maltravers: “Madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!” “What do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide. “Have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? You are mediumistic, you know.” “I have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism, surely?” “Madame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say in the village that this house is haunted?” She nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready.",0
"You always think you’re going to see and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along.",0
"“Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does ” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother. The magistrate understood. “As yet no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?” “I have no idea whatsoever.” M. Hautet sighed. “A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis.",0
"Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.” “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.” “What?” “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.” He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending. He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass.",0
"By the way, you said two minutes and you’ve been three, allowing for interruptions. For a woman, that’s quite remarkable! Must be your scientific training.” I was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been running. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance. I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively.",0
"""What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see.",0
"They were a pleasant couple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin, and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm. Tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s constant resting-place.",0
"As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to note down?” “The letter to you?” “That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning of the case.",0
"And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice: “I agree with you! She is certainly very good-looking.” It is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are. With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice hair. It is black a real black, not dark brown, and it grows well back from my forehead and down over the ears. With a ruthless hand I dragged it upwards. As ears, my ears are quite all right, but there is no doubt about it, ears are démodé nowadays.",0
"” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the salon door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?” The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality.",0
"And observe that ‘Peerage’ how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, method, which, as I have often told you, Hastings” “Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place. Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality. “Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too.",0
"Even I did not suspect triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, mon ami! On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle.",0
"The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all.",0
"When you got called to this job, did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed up in it?” “No, but ” “If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the same as I am? Of course you would.” “I’m a man. You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you will show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated.",0
"Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M.",0
"“What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out ” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “Cette dame? What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.",0
"So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it.",0
"” I had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed another figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in the rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew who it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic in the peaceful morning sunlight. What must he have thought of me? It made me hot to realize the things that I had said. And I hadn’t meant them or had I? I turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain. If Rayburn had come up here to be alone, I, at least, need not disturb him by advertising my presence.",0
"Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something that satisfied my aching hunger for romance. Perfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the Kilmorden glided nearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all dreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans are so anxious not to miss anything. “This is South Africa,” I kept saying to myself industriously, “South Africa, South Africa. You are seeing the world. This is the world. You are seeing it. Think of it, Anne Beddingfeld, you pudding-head. You’re seeing the world.",0
"“Look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to London?” “You think so, Hastings? Why?” “Well” I coughed delicately “things haven’t gone very well, have they? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose!” “True,” said Poirot, rather crestfallen. “It was not one of my most striking triumphs.” This way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I stuck to my guns.",0
"“May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn’t interest me.” “I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said Poirot sweetly. I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and, if so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he had no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground. Meanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over the boundary, and tried the door of the little shed. “That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish.",0
"Hautet and say that we will come at once.” Poirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But when he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. “He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly. We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M.",0
"Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several questions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English. Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.",0
"But if, by any chance, it was not her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings (it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told her as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out (according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession! “In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open.",0
"The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the Kilmorden seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr.",0
"I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace.",0
"""Would it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our visitor’s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.” Roger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart appearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently labouring under great agitation. “Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s partner, I understand. It is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.” “I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is ill in bed influenza.” His face fell. “Dear me, that is a great blow to me.",0
"What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong.",0
"I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, c’est comme ça!” Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?” “Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do either of you ever see Society Gossip?” We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly. “I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it’s really very curious” She broke off.",0
"No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He’s not to leave the house without orders.” He put the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping the table with his hand. “May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,” I said, after a minute or two of silence. “Certainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.",0
"Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted.",0
"I never did quite swallow that scar. Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track. She wants the glory of discovering him for herself and the Daily Budget. Young women are very cold-blooded nowadays. I hinted to her that it was an unwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she run him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn’t like it, either, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may all be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs.",0
"40 on the following afternoon and depart again at 6. I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed to me a good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was getting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got another chance. The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from Johannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram: “Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.” Eric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name I dislike exceedingly.",0
"It was the Prime Minister! “For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?” “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.” “What?” “I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face” “But by whom?” “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does.",0
"Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean that you’re in on that?” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as she regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she remained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically. “Well, if that doesn’t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all the horrors.” “What do you mean?” “What I say. Bless the boy, didn’t I tell you I doted on crimes? What do you think I’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over this stubble? I’ve been nosing round for hours.",0
"“I wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me? A woman’s hair h’m!” We lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris. “Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find this.” He took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the reproduction of a woman’s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an exclamation. “You recognize it, my friend?” I nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back, and the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was unmistakable.",0
"Hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay on the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having managed to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy, lying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart. Madame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep, she had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries, they had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous “secret.",0
"“Yes, I do feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.",0
"""I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs’s?” “I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.” “And no clerk has had access to them?” Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago in fact on the very day that Philip left us.",0
"""That’s another story,” I quoted. “My story. And I’m going to tell it you now.” Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been in my possession or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds.",0
"Part of me was appalled at the sudden disaster, and another part of me was coolly and dispassionately interested in the methods employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back onto the platform. “Let me pass, please. I am a medical man.” A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the motionless body. As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me. The thing wasn’t real couldn’t be. Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head. “Dead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.” We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice.",0
"His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question. “What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen, Mr. Ridgeway?” He laughed rather bitterly. “The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.” “But I understood that it had been opened with a key?” “That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t.",0
"But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. Sacré! if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.",0
"""I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure,” replied the young soldier; “but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my people’s, I didn’t know him very well myself.” “You came down when?” “Tuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock. But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.” “You were returning to East Africa, I understand?” “Yes. I’ve been out there ever since the War a great country.” “Exactly.",0
"But yes! Here it is! ‘Go it criminals all out! Hercule Poirot and believe me, girls, he’s some Hercules! our own pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’Cause why? ’Cause he’s got la grippe himself’!” I laughed. “Good for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character. And fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest during this time.” “That is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me with any regret.” Our landlady stuck her head in at the door. “There’s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain.",0
"Whether Luigi Valdarno was the thief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past Luigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the antecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about the time of Valdarno’s death.",0
"“What has South Africa to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms, her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and her diamonds” I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of the miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist.",0
"""Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?” “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow.",0
"He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course.",0
"My maid remains in the room till I come up, so there’s no need.” The inspector’s face grew graver. “Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then the maid has not left the room?” Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French.",0
"It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her.",0
"The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again: “And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .” “Poirot,” I cried, “I see” “You see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments.",0
"An event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure. The more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the British Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh zest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue. A fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York.",0
"“Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.",0
"“First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.” The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell. We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner. Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind.",0
"It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored.",0
"Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.” Black was straightforward enough over the matter. “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what” “What has it got to do with Mr.",0
"Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wrist watch which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.",0
"That is what always happens to me and, after all, this is my private car, not Race’s. Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the beauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her principal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn’t even doing that. Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don’t blame her if so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew she is a repellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman. There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld.",0
"He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for them. I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and airily trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously. That is what makes him so difficult to live with. Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence. He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there.",0
"“This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman.",0
"""Any trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good terms?” “I should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful. Mrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a nonentity, I think.” “Then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had he any enemies?” “He had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular good-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him and, if they had, where is the body?” “Exactly.",0
"The typewriter is in perfect condition.” “What do you mean all the cases?” “The two small cases as well.” “I wish you wouldn’t be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases were no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.” Pagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake. “So you can just pack them up again neatly,” I continued. “After that you can go out and look around you. Jo’burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last chance.” I thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the morning, at any rate. “There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure, Sir Eustace.” “I haven’t got it now,” I said hastily.",0
"I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me.",0
"Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound and you are a dead man, remember.’ “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.” “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?” “None whatever, monsieur.” “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?” “Yes. I had seen the change in him.",0
"On Friday we’re going down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly.” Her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some gossip what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California why! it came to me in a flash of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf. “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing.",0
"” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was omniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.",0
"“Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once I offer it again. Will you have it?” The fierceness of his answer took me aback. “No. I’ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise.",0
"First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had got what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls. There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident. That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and when Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me. “Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest.",0
"We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The mise en scène designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the dénouement ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs.",0
"“That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window.",0
"I regret to say that at the first roll the Kilmorden gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a totally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South Kensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office. I smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room. Mrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered. “Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over with you.",0
"""Have you the will or a copy of it with you?” Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it, nodding to himself. “Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also 11 a.m. that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made even half-an-hour later would upset this. Eh bien, mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you.",0
"Pagett from their position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind. I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary.",0
"""Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look. “You told me to get Cabin 17.” There is a touch of the “boy upon the burning deck” about Pagett. “My dear fellow,” I said testily, “I mentioned No. 17 because I happened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn’t mean you to make a stand to the death about it 13 or 28 would have done us equally well.” He looked hurt. “There’s something more, though,” he insisted.",0
"“Doesn’t bother me. Need more people like you around. Can’t stand guys who act up. Gets me riled.” She shook her head firmly. “What about you when you’re angry?” I asked, grinning. “Turn into a little demon! Say and do whatever I want! Almost took a guy out once. And he deserved it. Italian blood runs hot in me. Bound to get in trouble one day.” “Please,” I pleaded, “don’t get angry at me.” “Won’t happen. Liked you from the moment I saw you. But you seemed so judgmental, didn’t think we’d become friends.”",1
"He showed great kindness to his brother’s orphaned child, bringing me into his home and caring for me as if I were his own daughter. The estate, Crabtree Manor, may sound grand but is actually just a humble farmhouse. My uncle, deeply passionate about farming, was always trying out new agricultural methods. Despite his affection for me, he held firm beliefs about the proper upbringing of young women. Lacking formal education himself, he placed more importance on practical skills than on academic learning.",1
"I overheard an interesting conversation between Sir Eustace and another man about cabin allocations. Sir Eustace was adamant about not sharing his cabin, which led to a heated dispute with other passengers. In the end, the purser confirmed that Cabin 17 was mine, and the others had to choose between Nos. 13 and 28. I settled in, only to be greeted by a terrible smell in the cabin - asafœtida. It seemed someone was desperate to get me out of there, but why? The mystery of Cabin 17 continued to intrigue me.",1
"Upon unraveling the mystery, it became clear that de Castina, or whoever she truly was, had arranged to rendezvous at the Mill House. The pieces fell into place as I deduced their clever tactic of obtaining simultaneous house viewings to avoid suspicion. The sudden encounter between the ""doctor"" and the Moth Ball man indicated an unforeseen and unsettling turn of events. With the disguise discarded, the ""doctor"" discreetly trailed the woman to Marlow, leaving a trail of unanswered questions in their wake.",1
"Jack hurried to catch his train in Paris after retrieving his forgotten bag from the library. Meanwhile, Léonie shared details of a heated argument she witnessed between Jack and an unknown person. As Poirot decided to wait in the salon, I ventured out to observe Giraud's investigation methods. Suddenly, I collided with Cinderella, who seemed to be intrigued by the murder at Villa Geneviève. Despite my reluctance, she insisted on exploring the crime scene, displaying a morbid curiosity that unsettled me.",1
"We returned to the bridge, followed by a woman burdened with all the household items stacked precariously on her head, including a frying pan. Suzanne regretted not having her camera, but Colonel Race assured her that opportunities would arise. As we reached the bridge, Colonel Race proposed exploring the rainbow forest, questioning whether we were afraid of getting wet. Suzanne and I agreed to join him, while Sir Eustace headed back to the hotel. However, the rainbow forest did not meet my expectations.",1
"Why did the murder have to happen in my own home? Out of all the homes in the country, why choose my Mill House? What did I ever do to deserve this? Suzanne offered her sympathy once more as Sir Eustace continued in a tone filled with frustration. And to make matters worse, the man who committed the crime had the audacity to become my secretary. My secretary! I've had enough of them - they're either killers in disguise or troublemakers. Have you seen Pagett's bruised eye? It's time to put an end to this.",1
"""He must have escaped through the window before we arrived,"" explained the officer. ""Mrs. Havering had me go fetch the police, which was a five-mile walk. They returned with me, and a constable stayed the night. The next morning, a detective from London arrived."" Curious, the inspector inquired about the man who visited Mr. Pace. ""He had a black beard, was middle-aged, and wore a light overcoat,"" the housekeeper recalled. ""Other than his American accent, there wasn't much else that stood out about him.""",1
"""I had considered leaving in a month's time."" ""Could you leave sooner? This month? This week?"" ""Yes, I could,"" I replied, studying him intently. ""But I'm not sure if I really want to."" ""Your help would be greatly appreciated by the Government. You would not be disappointed."" ""So, you want me to deliver something?"" ""Yes, exactly. Your role is unofficial, your trip is legitimate. Everything will be perfectly fine."" ""Alright,"" I hesitated, ""I suppose I can. All I want is to leave England as soon as I can.""",1
"""I need to inquire, Lady Yardly, about the postmarks on the letters you were sent,"" he asked. Lady Yardly, with a hint of regret, replied, ""I'm sorry, but I can't recall. It never crossed my mind to pay attention to such details."" ""Will you be staying the night?"" Lord Yardly inquired. ""Oh, my lord, I wouldn't want to impose. Our belongings are still at the inn,"" she responded. ""Don't worry about that,"" Lord Yardly quickly interjected. ""We'll have them brought here. It's no trouble at all, I assure you.""",1
"“May I bring in this gentleman to assist?” Mr. Opalsen asked. The man nodded, showing no interest. “Now that your wife is feeling better, can she tell us what happened?” Mrs. Opalsen turned to Poirot for guidance. He motioned for her to sit and share the details. Mrs. Opalsen composed herself and began, “I went to my room after dinner to get my pearls. The chambermaid and Célestine were both present, as they always were.” Mr. Opalsen interjected, “What do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mrs. Opalsen clarified.",1
"""Ha!” exclaimed the inspector, slamming his hand onto the desk. “You dare play games with the authorities, do you? I insist you reveal the identity of the woman who visited Mr. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police, the police,” muttered Françoise. “I never imagined I would get involved with the police. But I know exactly who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissioner gasped in shock and leaned in closer. “Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite nearby?” “Exactly, sir,” Françoise confirmed.",1
"""We proceeded in silence. Once there, much to my surprise, Poirot swiftly changed his attire. ""I am heading to London tonight,"" he stated. ""It is crucial."" ""What?"" ""Absolutely. The real mental work is completed. I am off to confirm. I will discover it! Impossible to outsmart Hercule Poirot!"" ""You'll fail one day,"" I remarked, feeling repulsed by his arrogance. ""Do not be upset, my friend. I am relying on your friendship for a favor."" ""Of course,"" I replied eagerly, feeling remorseful for my sullenness.",1
"""Who would want to work on a ship anyway? Sure, I promised my publishers my 'Reminiscences' by summer, but who really cares? Only old ladies in the suburbs read that stuff. My so-called famous encounters are nothing special. With Pagett's help, I fabricate dull stories about them. But Pagett is too ethical. He refuses to let me make up tales about people I never actually met. I tried being nice. 'You still look like a wreck, my friend,' I joked. 'You need some sun in a deck-chair. No need to say more.""",1
"""And my marriage isn't as stable as I thought,"" Suzanne said sadly. ""Clarence has been sending urgent messages for me to return home, but I've ignored them for weeks now."" I couldn't bring myself to be too concerned about Suzanne's marital issues. She had a way of handling Clarence when necessary. Changing the topic, I brought up the matter of the missing diamonds. Suzanne's eyes widened in shock. ""Let me clarify, Anne. When I started suspecting Colonel Race, I became very anxious about the diamonds.""",1
"""And that fool Giraud, crawling all over it in search of match ends! Didn't I mention that a clue of two feet long is just as valuable as a clue of two inches?"" ""Giraud will be humbled now,"" I quickly remarked, trying to divert attention from my mistakes. ""As I mentioned earlier, will he? If he has found the correct suspect using the wrong approach, he won't be bothered by that."" ""But of course"" I stopped as I noticed the shift in direction. ""You see, Hastings, we need to begin anew. Who murdered M. """,1
"""But why Marlow?"" I questioned, feeling the weight of the circumstances pressing down on me. ""It was a mistake, but in the moment it felt right. It still feels right, given the circumstances."" ""What circumstances?"" I demanded, desperation creeping into my voice. Pagett finally turned his attention to me, realizing my inquiry. ""I apologize, Miss Beddingfeld,"" he responded coldly, ""but I fail to understand your involvement in this situation."" As he leaned in closer, I could sense my desperation growing.",1
"""Ten minutes passed before the door creaked open, revealing a slim figure dressed in mourning attire. 'Monsieur Poirot?' she hesitated. Poirot gallantly rose to his feet and hurried to her side. 'Madame!' he exclaimed. 'I apologize for the intrusion. But alas, business knows no bounds.' Mrs. Maltravers allowed him to guide her to a chair. Her eyes were swollen from crying, yet her beauty shone through. She appeared to be in her late twenties, fair-skinned with piercing blue eyes and a delicate mouth.""",1
"“What brings you here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he asked suddenly, lifting me effortlessly off the ground. I could feel his powerful grip as he gently placed me back down. There was something intimidating about his presence, standing inches away from me, his gaze fixed on my face. “I’m just a wanderer,” I replied. “A gypsy at heart.” “Indeed, a clever disguise. You're not a journalist at heart, that much is clear. You're a seeker of thrills, willing to take what you desire. But there's more to it than that.",1
"I noticed my pencil resting against the closed cupboard door. It struck me that had the door been open, my pencil would have surely found its way inside. Intrigued, I opened the door, allowing the pencil to escape into the shadows of the far corner. As I reached for it, I realized that the dim light and odd structure of the cupboard made it nearly impossible to spot the pencil without touch. Satisfied with the retrieval, I decided to check the cupboard beneath the window on the other side of the room.",1
"""I hesitated to linger at the Falls, worried he may have taken you nearby, but was unsure how to handle the diamonds. I was too scared to hold onto them,"" Suzanne glanced nervously around, checking for eavesdroppers, then leaned in close to whisper urgently. ""A wise decision,"" I agreed. ""At the moment, anyway. It's complicated now. Where did Sir Eustace send the cases?"" ""The large ones were shipped off to Cape Town. Pagett informed me before I departed the Falls, and he included the storage receipt.""",1
"""Of course,"" I muttered weakly. ""You won't breathe a word to anyone about me coming along."" ""Certainly,"" I repeated. Despite my hesitation, having this man by my side might be for the best, though a sense of foreboding lingered. Just as I believed I had found peace! I halted my guest as he made to leave. ""It might be wise to know the name of my new assistant,"" I remarked dryly. He paused, then responded, ""Harry Rayburn suits just fine."" An odd choice of words. ""Agreed,"" I conceded for the third time.",1
"“You might uncover more clues in France.” “Perhaps, my friend, but I am skeptical. It amazes me that the Prime Minister has not been found in that small area, where hiding him would be incredibly difficult. If the military and police of two nations have failed to locate him, how can I succeed?” Mr. Dodge greeted us at Charing Cross. “Meet Detective Barnes from Scotland Yard and Major Norman. They are here to assist you. Best of luck. It’s a tough situation, but I remain optimistic. I must leave now.”",1
"Poirot spent only a brief moment at each stop, yet his confidence seemed to grow with each one. He exchanged a few words with Norman, who pointed towards a side road saying, ""They are waiting by the bridge if you go left."" As we veered off onto the side road, I noticed a second car parked along the roadside in the dwindling light. Two men in civilian clothing sat inside. Poirot stepped out and conversed with them briefly before we set off towards the north, with the other car trailing closely behind.",1
"""It appeared that Poirot was fixated on this particular spot. ""What's the plan?"" I asked quietly. ""Wait."" ""But-"" ""I don't anticipate any action for at least an hour, maybe two, but-"" His sentence was cut off by a sudden, piercing cry: ""Help!"" A beam of light illuminated the second floor window on the right side of the building. The cry originated from that location. As we observed, a silhouette appeared on the curtain, indicating a struggle between two individuals. ""Great thunder!"" exclaimed Poirot.",1
"""Poor chap is still recovering."" ""Severe bronchitis can really knock a man down,"" Mr. Shaw admitted sadly. ""But I fear Mr. Vavasour may have been overwhelmed by my absence, especially with this unexpected problem arising."" Poirot probed further with his questions, trying to assess the relationship between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour's responses were short and formal. His nephew, a reliable bank employee, had no financial troubles or debts that he was aware of. He had handled similar tasks before.",1
"""Very well,"" I said weakly. ""You won't mention to anyone that I'm coming with you."" ""Very well,"" I repeated. It may be better to have this guy with me, but I had a feeling that I was headed into trouble. Just when I thought I had found peace! I stopped him as he was leaving. ""I should probably know the name of my new secretary,"" I remarked sarcastically. He thought for a moment. ""Harry Rayburn sounds like a good name,"" he said. It was an odd way of putting it. ""Very well,"" I said for the third time.",1
"""We won't be needing it at the moment."" ""But what if he tries to run away?"" Poirot chuckled. ""He won't."" I quickly fetched the taxi that was waiting. The stranger's scarf was removed from his face, and I was taken aback. ""He's not Japanese,"" I whispered to Poirot. ""You always had a keen eye for observation, Hastings! You don't miss a thing. No, he's not Japanese. He's Italian."" We entered the taxi, and Poirot instructed the driver to go to an address in St. John's Wood. I was now thoroughly puzzled.",1
"He once again dodged as the lion leaped over him. This scenario repeated twice more before he reached the tent's entrance, where he grabbed his rifle. Upon reemerging with rifle in hand, the lion was nowhere to be seen, leaving him perplexed. Moving cautiously to the rear of the tent, he discovered the lion in a small clearing, practicing low jumps. The audience erupted in cheers as I sipped my champagne. ""On a different note,"" I interjected, ""my acquaintance encountered another peculiar situation.""",1
"In this tale, we encounter a cunning and devious woman who is well aware of her husband's financial troubles. She grows weary of her elderly spouse, whom she married solely for his wealth, and hatches a plan to have him take out a sizable life insurance policy. After a fortuitous accident involving a young soldier, she seizes upon an opportunity to carry out her scheme. The following day, believing her husband to be away at sea, she casually remarks on the peculiar story shared the previous evening.",1
"She described how he had become involved in various political plots and mentioned certain crucial documents that had been given to him for safekeeping, involving a significant European ""secret"". Madame Beroldy had entrusted him with these papers to mislead those chasing them, but she felt anxious after spotting key figures from the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. Then, on November 28th, disaster struck. The maid who regularly tended to the Beroldys' home discovered the apartment door left ajar, ajar.",1
"Upon reflection, Havering's encounter with the mysterious figure could be crucial to cracking the case. With her keen eye for detail, she might have observed something pivotal. I promptly penned a detailed letter to Poirot, elaborating on the situation. Additional pieces of evidence were included before I dispatched the correspondence. The bullet recovered matched a revolver in police possession. Moreover, Mr. Havering's alibi was corroborated, confirming his presence in London on the fateful night.",1
"“Have you looked into Lowen's connection to Davenheim on the night in question?”“Yes, it appears that Lowen and Davenheim had a strained relationship. Lowen, a small-time speculator, managed to outsmart Davenheim in the market a few times, despite rarely meeting in person. The meeting was related to South American shares, prompting Davenheim to schedule it.”“Did Davenheim have investments in South America?”“It seems likely. Mrs. Davenheim shared that he had spent the previous fall in Buenos Ayres.”",1
"He was sprawled out near a small copse. It seemed he was hunting rooks, a small rifle lay by his side. The bleeding appeared to be sudden. Definitely a gastric ulcer."" ""No indication of a gunshot wound, correct?"" ""Absolutely not!"" ""I apologize,"" Poirot said meekly. ""But, if I recall correctly, in a prior murder case, the doctor initially concluded heart failure but changed it to a gunshot wound after the constable noticed a bullet hole in the head!"" ""There are no bullet wounds on Mr. Smith's body.""",1
""" The young man shook his head vigorously, and the judge, always eager to challenge Giraud, responded. “Not now. M. Bex will kindly bring it to us here.” The police commissioner exited the room. Stonor approached Jack, shaking his hand. Poirot stood up and straightened a pair of candlesticks that caught his attention. The judge re-read the mysterious love letter, holding onto his theory of jealousy and betrayal. Suddenly, the door swung open and the commissioner hurried in. “Judge! Judge!” “Yes.""",1
"""My friend,"" I exclaimed, ""you must leave tomorrow. I will cover all your costs."" Florence in January was not the typical choice, but Pagett seemed unfazed. I could picture him exploring the galleries, guidebook in hand. A week of solitude was well worth the expense. The past week had been pure bliss. I had indulged in all my desires, free from any unwanted obligations. However, as I awoke to find Pagett blocking the morning light at the ungodly hour of 9 a.m., I knew our time had come to an end.",1
"”People from all walks of life have been urging me to tell this tale, from the highest echelons (like Lord Nasby) to the lowest (such as our former maid, Emily, who I encountered during my recent trip to England. “Oh, miss, what a marvelous novel you could craft from these events, just like in the paintings!”). I must acknowledge that I am well-suited for the job. I was involved in this case from its inception, I navigated every twist and turn, and I ultimately witnessed its conclusion firsthand.",1
"As the butler entered, a telegram was presented to Lord Yardly on a silver platter. After a quick apology, he opened it and his expression changed. Passing it to his wife, he then turned to Monsieur Poirot. ""I believe you should be informed. Hoffberg has a potential buyer for the diamond - an American leaving for the States tomorrow. A representative will inspect the stone tonight. If this deal goes through..."" Lord Yardly's voice trailed off, his wife staring blankly at the telegram in her hand.",1
"He couldn't remember the last time he had worn them. Where were they stored? Sometimes in one spot, sometimes in another. The shovel was typically in the small tool shed. Was it secured? Naturally it was locked. Where was the key hidden? Ah, it was in the door naturally! There was nothing worth stealing. Who would anticipate a gang of thieves, of murderers? Such events never occurred during Madame la Vicomtesse's era. Mr. Hautet indicating he was done, the elderly man left, grumbling all the way.",1
"Who was this mysterious young man who barged into my cabin unannounced? He was a complete stranger to me, not a crew member nor a fellow passenger. The real question remained: who was responsible for stabbing him, and for what reason? And what significance did Cabin No. 17 hold in this puzzling situation? As I pondered these questions, it became clear that something sinister was unfolding aboard the Kilmorden Castle. My list of suspects grew as I mentally noted those who required closer scrutiny.",1
"""But there's a good chance he'll have an extra one for himself."" ""But no one has brought that up,"" I countered. Poirot's voice took on a hint of authority. ""My dear friend, when solving a case, one mustn't rely solely on what is 'brought up.' Many crucial details may not be mentioned at all. And there are valid reasons for keeping them quiet. It's up to you to decide which is at play."" I fell silent, feeling a sense of awe creeping over me. In just a few moments, we arrived at the renowned shed.",1
"""He appeared deep in thought, his forehead furrowed in concentration. It was clear that his sharp mind was finally kicking into gear. The anticipation grew as we waited for him to speak. Suddenly, breaking the silence, he turned to Japp and inquired, 'Do you happen to know if Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim shared a bedroom?' The question caught us off guard, leaving us momentarily speechless. Japp couldn't help but burst into laughter. 'Oh Monsieur Poirot, I was expecting something much more dramatic!'""",1
"""I have no intention of dressing you in frocks. I'm more inclined to rip them off of you. You belong to me, understand? If I let you go, I might lose you. I'm bringing you with me tonight, no matter what anyone says."" He embraced me tightly, kissing me deeply. ""I can't be without you any longer, Anne. I despise this wealth. Let Race take it. Come with me. Let's leave."" ""But my toothbrush?"" I hesitated. ""You can buy a new one. I know I'm crazy, but please, come with me!"" He stormed off in a rage.",1
"""The contents of her letter truly revealed her feelings of love, making any offer of money an insult. Eventually, he managed to dismiss her, and the choice of his words was telling."" ""'Please, leave now,' I urged. His words seemed forceful, but necessary."" ""He was eager for her to depart, not just due to the discomfort of the meeting. No, it was the ticking clock that mattered, time held significance for some unknown reason."" ""Why the rush?"" I inquired, puzzled. ""This is the question we ponder.""",1
"""The man had gone off to fight in the war, showing courage and valor. He was declared missing, wounded, and presumed dead.

After some persuasion, he revealed that the lady in question seemed unafraid, suggesting it was all part of a harmless prank or bet. Slowly but surely, I extracted all the details from him.""",1

That’s how I ended up with the powder on my finger, and, in my excitement, I rubbed it on my sleeve in a moment of carelessness, going against all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I inquired, showing little concern for Poirot’s principles.",1
"""Yet, I know he can be found there. You may not comprehend now, but I will reveal everything in due time. Trust me, this trip to Paris is crucial. I won't be gone for long. Most likely, I'll be back by tomorrow. I don't suggest you come along. Stay here and watch over Giraud. Also, spend time with M. Renauld's son.

Despite his cunning intellect, Foscatini struggles to stomach three tournedos and a rice soufflé. Desperate to maintain his facade, he even indulges in a cigar and two cigarettes.",1
"We were both immediately captivated by her, and the news hit us both like a ton of bricks. Surprisingly, it didn't strain our friendship in the least. In fact, we were both prepared to step back and let the other pursue her. However, that wasn't her intention. Looking back, I couldn't help but wonder why she didn't go for it, considering Sir Laurence Eardsley's son was quite the catch. As it turns out, she was secretly married to a De Beers' employee, a detail that had escaped everyone's notice.",1
"” Upon arriving at our hotel, he signaled for silence and we proceeded to have lunch with great appetite. It was clear to me that Poirot preferred not to discuss the recent tragedy in a public setting. Despite this, the topic weighed heavily on my mind, leaving no room for other conversation. We sat in silence for some time until Poirot slyly remarked, “Well! What about your little slip-ups? Care to share?” My face grew warm as I tried to downplay the morning's events with casual indifference.”",1
"The final response, conversely, is the cornerstone of my hypothesis.” I threw my hands up in defeat. “I surrender.” While traveling to London by train, Poirot wrote diligently for a brief period, sealing the outcome in an envelope. “This is for Inspector McNeil. We will drop it off at Scotland Yard on our way, and then head to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where Miss Esmée Farquhar has graciously agreed to join us for dinner.” “And Ridgeway?” “What of him?” inquired Poirot with a gleam in his eye.",1
"”Pondering the new realm of possibilities unveiled by Poirot’s deductions, I reflected on his enigmatic references to the flower bed and wrist watch. Initially seeming insignificant, his comments now revealed his astute unraveling of the mystery at hand. I silently praised my friend’s methodical approach, which he acknowledged with a wise nod. “Method is key,” he affirmed. “Organize your facts, organize your thoughts. And if a detail seems out of place, scrutinize it instead of dismissing it.”",1
"“We should bring him home, to Villa Marguerite. My mother and I will take care of him. Poor Jack!” With great effort, we managed to transport the boy to the Villa, where he collapsed into a chair, looking disoriented. Poirot checked his temperature and pulse. “He's running a fever.

""We don't keep a car here. A vehicle from the Elmer's Dale garage picked him up."" ""Was Mr. Pace his usual self?"" ""Completely. Nothing seemed amiss."" ""Can you provide any details about the visitor?"" ""I'm sorry, I never laid eyes on him. Mrs. Middleton ushered him into the gun-room before informing my uncle.""",1
"Approaching closer, Madame Daubreuil's complexion regained a hint of color as she gazed down at the victim with a hint of intrigue. ""I have never seen him before,"" she stated, her words sounding genuine. Giraud nodded, indicating she could leave, prompting me to question the decision quietly. ""Are you sure it's wise to let her go? That black hair likely belongs to her."" With a dry tone, Giraud responded, ""I know how to handle my business. She is being watched. No need to arrest her just yet.""",1
"As my rescuer turned towards me, a sense of urgency emanated from him. ""You're injured!"" His voice held a hint of danger towards whoever had caused me harm. In that instant, I recognized him - the man with the scar. But before he could react, our fallen adversary had already bolted up and fled. Rayburn cursed as he pursued the enemy, leaving me behind. Feeling left out, I reluctantly joined the pursuit, lagging behind. We raced around the deck, finally reaching the starboard side of the ship.",1
"But she had firmly rejected any further involvement with her husband's killer, leading him to retaliate by sending a letter accusing her. She adamantly denied any part in plotting the crime, claiming she only discovered Georges Conneau with the bloody knife in hand that fateful night. Madame Beroldy's account was dubious at best, yet her talent for persuasion, honed through tales of royal scandals, made her narrative convincing. Her closing argument to the jury was nothing short of brilliant.",1
"""And what do you think happened?"" ""I am not ready to reveal my theory just yet. My investigation has only just begun,"" replied the detective. ""One question, M. Giraud,"" Poirot interjected. ""Your theory accounts for the door being opened, but why was it left ajar? Wouldn't it have been more logical to close it upon their departure? If a police officer happened to pass by to check on the premises, they could have been caught immediately."" ""They simply overlooked it. A careless error, I admit.""",1
"""His defeat was quite resounding.” “Poor Giraud,” Poirot remarked, attempting to appear humble. “It’s not solely due to his incompetence. He’s had some bad luck on a few occasions. Like the dark hair wrapped around the dagger, for example. It was rather deceptive, to say the least.” “Honestly, Poirot,” I began slowly, “I’m still not entirely sure whose hair it was?” “Madame Renauld’s, obviously. That’s where the bad luck played into it. Her hair, which was dark before, is now mostly silver.”",1
"""The inspector was amused by the overly polite demeanor. Célestine left in tears, escorted by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Without much explanation to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector began searching the room. Drawers were pulled out, cupboards opened, the bed was left in disarray, and even the floor was tapped. Mr. Opalsen watched skeptically. “Do you truly believe you will uncover them?” “Absolutely. It's logical. She wouldn't have had the opportunity to remove them from the room.""",1
"""We positioned ourselves on the grassy hill as Poirot advised, gazing towards the ocean. In the distance, the sounds of swimmers could be heard faintly. The sea glistened with the lightest shade of blue, evoking memories of our arrival in Merlinville and Poirot's teasing remark about my demeanor. It felt like ages had passed, though only three days had gone by. ""Focus, my dear,"" Poirot urged. ""Organize your thoughts. Approach this methodically and systematically. That is the key to triumph.""",1
"I was in the middle of a conversation with him about the shocking events of that day - the failed assassination attempt on Mr. David MacAdam, the Prime Minister of England. The newspapers had little information, only mentioning that the Prime Minister narrowly avoided the bullet. It was clear that our law enforcement had been negligent for such a serious incident to occur. I couldn't help but think that German spies operating in England would go to great lengths to pull off such a bold move.",1
"I perched on the edge of my cot, clad in my vibrant gipsy attire, mulling over the predicament. My mind drifted to Colonel Race, who had shown me favor. I believed he would offer compassion and intelligence. However, upon further reflection, doubts crept in. His forceful demeanor could easily overshadow my ownership of the case. It was my puzzle to solve! Unspoken motives lingered, dissuading me from entrusting Colonel Race. My thoughts then turned to Mrs. Blair, another source of kindness.",1
"""As we drove back from the Matoppos that day, I made a decision. And now, I can confidently say that I have followed through. The man you care for is no longer under any shadow of doubt."" ""So that was your intention all along?"" ""Yes, it was."" I felt a wave of guilt for ever suspecting otherwise. He continued, his voice filled with reflection: ""In my youth, I loved a woman who left me heartbroken. I dedicated myself to my profession after that. But when I met you, Anne, everything changed.""",1
"""I have some questions for you tomorrow, and once you answer, we will know how to proceed. We have ways to make stubborn people talk,"" he said sternly. Despite the grim situation, I was relieved to have until the following day. This man seemed to be following orders from someone higher up. Could it be Pagett? He called for two Kafirs, who escorted me upstairs. Despite my efforts to resist, I was quickly gagged and bound. The room they brought me to was an attic, dusty and seemingly unused.",1
"As we approached the town of Merlinville, a sense of unease crept over me. My companion, with a grave expression, muttered about a looming disaster that he could not quite explain. Despite my skepticism, his words left a chill in the air. He hinted at a big affair, a complex problem that would not be easily resolved. Just then, we reached Merlinville and sought directions to the Villa Geneviève. A local pointed us in the right direction, guiding us through the town towards our destination.",1
"Despite my concerns for young Willard, the Anubis figure you witnessed last night was actually Hassan disguised at my request. I orchestrated the charade to test the doctor's nerves, but it was clear that he saw through my feigned belief in the supernatural. The performance I put on failed to dupe him. I had a hunch that he would try to target me next. Despite the cursed sea, the oppressive heat, and the sand's irritations, my keen intellect remained sharp. Poirot's instincts were spot on.",1
"I couldn't help but wonder what he was searching for in that place. There was a hint of worry in his question, which made me stand taller. ""I cannot disclose that information,"" I replied calmly. Giraud fixed me with a sharp stare. ""He's smart enough not to confide in you,"" he said bluntly before abruptly leaving. It seemed that I was not welcome at the Villa Geneviève. Jack Renauld seemed to share the sentiment. I decided to head back to town, take a relaxing bath, and return to the hotel.",1
"“Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that fateful night, and if not Marthe, then who did he see?” “Poirot, you can’t possibly think a young man like him would kill his own father,” I exclaimed. “My friend, your naivety is astonishing! I have witnessed mothers who have slain their own children for money. After that, nothing surprises me.” “And the reason?” “Greed, as always. Jack believed he would inherit half of his father’s wealth upon his demise.” “But what about the vagrant?”",1
"""I can never shake off the guilt of his death. It will be a burden I carry forever!"" ""No, no,"" I reassured. ""It's chilling to think that Bella was the one who took my father's life,"" Jack continued, ""but I had wronged her. When I crossed paths with Marthe, and saw my error, I should have reached out and admitted my fault. Yet, the fear of confrontation, and the worry of Marthe misconstruing the situation, held me back. I lacked courage and simply hoped the issue would resolve on its own.""",1
"“I was just summarizing the key aspects of the case,” I explained to Poirot. “Ah, so you’re finally becoming systematic,” he remarked, nodding in approval. I hesitated before continuing, “Here are my notes: '1. The evidence strongly suggests that Lowen was the one who broke into the safe. 2. Lowen harbored a grudge against Davenheim. 3. Lowen lied about his whereabouts in his initial statement. 4. Billy Kellett's account directly connects Lowen to the crime.'” I awaited Poirot's response.",1
"""Japp always had a way of surprising me with his antics, prompting a chuckle from deep within. Meanwhile, Poirot remained composed as he sifted through his mail. A request to speak at the local boy scouts event, a visit from the Countess of Forfanock - most likely about her pampered lap-dog. But then, a shift in Poirot's demeanor caught my attention. With a sense of urgency, he passed me a particular sheet of paper. 'This is quite unusual,' he remarked. Taking the paper, I began to read.""",1
"""Much to my astonishment, Poirot repeated almost verbatim what he had told Bex the night before: “I must disagree with you. The door being left ajar was not by chance, but rather a deliberate choice or a pressing need. Any hypothesis that overlooks this fact is destined to fail.” We watched in disbelief as the little man held his ground. Despite revealing his ignorance regarding the match outcome earlier, he now appeared unfazed, confidently asserting his position to the esteemed Giraud.""",1
"On the ground was a body covered by a dark cloth, concealing the face. ""Dead?"" I asked. She confirmed. ""I believe so."" ""Perhaps they hit their head on the marble fender."" ""But who is it?"" I inquired. ""The killer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the attempted killer of Madame Renauld."" Perplexed, I knelt down and uncovered the face, revealing the lifeless and stunning features of Marthe Daubreuil. My mind was a jumble of memories from that fateful night. Poirot remained silent to my inquiries.",1
"“After the disastrous turn of events, wouldn’t it be best to make a swift exit?” “But what about the exquisite dinner Lord Yardly’s chef has prepared?” “Forget the dinner,” I snapped. Poirot looked scandalized. “Mon Dieu! You Brits take food too lightly.” “There’s another pressing matter that requires our attention,” I pressed on. “And what might that be?” “The second diamond,” I whispered. “Miss Marvell’s.” “Well, what about it?” “Can’t you see?” His lack of understanding frustrated me.",1
"""The work can wait,"" he stated firmly. Suddenly, his attention shifted to the issue of an additional cabin. ""There's no space for work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It's overflowing with trunks,"" he exclaimed. His disdain for the trunks was palpable, as if they were unwanted pests. I tried to lighten the mood by reminding him of the necessity of packing extra clothing when traveling. He responded with his usual weak smile, brushing off my attempt at humor and returning to the task at hand.",1
"As we arrived at Boulogne Harbor, Poirot greeted me with a smile, whispering that Laverguier's plan had been a success. Japp continued to study his map, insisting that the criminals must have switched cars to evade detection. The tall detective suggested checking the seaports, suspecting the Prime Minister may have been smuggled onto a ship. However, Japp dismissed this idea, explaining that all ports had been closed off immediately. The sun began to rise as we disembarked from the boat.",1
"I waited impatiently for what felt like an eternity before deciding to take matters into my own hands. Casually slipping a few bills into the concierge's hand, I inquired about a mysterious woman I was searching for. Describing her as a petite, dark-haired English lady, I was met with a puzzled expression. ""Perhaps she is American?"" I ventured, growing frustrated with the man's lack of cooperation. Despite my efforts, the concierge insisted that such a woman was not a guest at the hotel.",1
"The love between us had to withstand scrutiny, and once my parents acknowledged its depth, they would surely come around. I had not shared with her my father's main concern about our relationship. I quickly realized that force would not help my case. My father sent me many caring letters from Paris, avoiding any mention of our dispute or its roots, and I responded in kind."" ""You have those letters, right?"" asked Giraud. ""I didn't hold on to them."" ""Doesn't matter,"" the detective replied.",1
"""Always twisting the facts to fit the theory! Did Giraud not discover traces of a man and a woman in the shed? How does that align with his case reconstruction? It doesn't, and so we must dismiss them! Is this a methodical approach? The esteemed Giraud! He is merely a self-important balloon. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he looks down upon, will be the pin to burst that balloon."" Hercule Poirot paused, then continued, ""Undoubtedly, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will reveal the truth.""",1
"""Are you serious?"" ""Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds."" ""How long had he been dead?"" Dr. Durand provided the answer. ""I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have occurred at least seven, and possibly ten hours earlier."" ""Hm, so between midnight and 3 a.m."" ""Precisely, and Madame Renauld’s testimony places it after 2 a.m. which further narrows down the time frame. Death was instant and clearly not self-inflicted.""",1
"""They decided to adopt a common name,"" he explained. ""Elsa Hardt and her companion from New York rented a flat under the alias Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. When they realized they were being pursued by a dangerous secret society, they devised a cunning plan. Knowing that their enemies were unfamiliar with their appearance, they advertised the flat at an unusually low price. With countless Robinsons searching for accommodation in London, they were confident their pursuers would be led astray.""",1
"I clutched the note in my hand, heart pounding. The words were brief but filled with urgency: “We must meet in the clearing by the palm gully. Remember Cabin 17. - Harry Rayburn.” A shiver ran down my spine. Harry was close, I could feel it. Wrapping a scarf around my head, I crept towards the door, cautious of prying eyes. He was a wanted man, and our meeting had to remain a secret. Passing Suzanne's room, I heard her gentle snores. Sir Eustace's door loomed ahead, my next destination.",1
"Reworked text excerpt: The task at hand was intricate, demanding precision. The informant, Coghan, stood before us - tall, weathered, with a touch of gray in his mustache. His demeanor suggested sharp intellect. Back at Crabtree Manor, we wasted no time, entering the study and setting our plan into motion. Pressing on the unassuming bricks revealed a hidden compartment, invisible to the eye. Poirot eagerly reached inside, only to be met with disappointment - a mere scrap of burnt paper.",1
"The statements, though absurd and baseless, were fervently believed by many. Despite this, the prosecution remained relentless in their pursuit of justice. They refuted the existence of the mysterious ""Russians"" and instead accused Madame Beroldy and her accomplice, Georges Conneau, of the crime. While a warrant was issued for Conneau's arrest, he had cunningly vanished. It was revealed that the restraints holding Madame Beroldy were in fact loose enough for her to escape at any moment.",1
"""Despite the lack of clarity, rest assured that it holds importance."" ""At this moment,"" I pondered, ""even with more information, we are no closer to uncovering the truth behind Mr. Renauld's murder."" ""Correct,"" Poirot said cheerfully. ""In reality, we are much further away."" His strange contentment made me stare at him in disbelief. He caught my gaze and grinned. ""Indeed, it is for the best. Previously, there was a solid theory on the circumstances of his death. Now, that has vanished.""",1
"""I was just chatting with Miller, the investigator working on the Davenheim case,"" I overheard. The mysterious vanishing of Mr. Davenheim, a prominent figure in the banking world, had captured headlines for days. Eager to learn more, I engaged in conversation with Japp, hoping for some intriguing insights. ""In this day and age, disappearing seems nearly impossible,"" I mused. Poirot, adjusting a plate of bread and butter with precision, interjected sharply: ""Accuracy is key, my friend.""",1
"Poirot's eyes flashed with malice. ""No need to trouble yourself for information. The Dulcibella Sisters have terminated their contract and disappeared from Coventry,"" he stated confidently. ""Are you certain, Poirot?"" I inquired. ""Absolutely, Hastings. I verified it this morning. What else did you anticipate?"" Indeed, there was nothing else to expect. Cinderella had taken advantage of the head start I provided and would waste no time in evading capture. My intentions had been fulfilled.",1
"The accusation was outrageous! To think that she would be implicated in stealing from Madame! The authorities were notoriously incompetent! However, Monsieur, a Frenchman ""A Belgian,"" Poirot interjected, but Célestine ignored the correction. Monsieur refused to let her be wrongly blamed, especially when that scandalous chambermaid was walking free. She always distrusted her, a brazen, rosy-cheeked woman, clearly a thief. From the beginning, she had a feeling that she was untrustworthy.",1
"“Ah, what an idea! You saw me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Well, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Combine those facts with another, that M. Jack Renauld rushed out of the house on his way to Paris, and tell me what you think!” “I understand,” I replied slowly, as Poirot’s words sank in. “That letter was meant for Jack Renauld, not his father. He mistakenly took the wrong overcoat in his haste and anxiety.” Poirot nodded. “Exactly! We can revisit this later.",1
"""Captain Hastings, we decided to visit Stosser and Paul, despite their reputation for expensive Mayfair flats. They offered us properties for four or five hundred a year, or with huge premiums. At the last minute, they mentioned an eighty-pound flat, but warned us that it had been on the market for some time and might already be taken. The clerk complained about people not confirming if they were interested, leading to wasted viewings. It was a frustrating situation for all involved.""",1
"""Currently, I am swamped with work,"" Pagett announced. ""Oh, before you go,"" I called out, ""what did Mrs. Blair have in those suitcases?"" ""Just some fur rugs and a few fur hats, I believe."" ""Yes, that sounds right,"" I agreed. ""She picked them up on the train. They are rather unique hats, so I understand why you couldn't place them. Any other items of interest?"" ""A few rolls of film and numerous baskets,"" Pagett responded. ""Of course,"" I nodded. ""Mrs. Blair tends to buy things in bulk.""",1
"In the dim light, there was little to distinguish him, a man who could easily blend into the background. He greeted the dancer with a bow that bordered on theatrical. ""Madame, it is truly a pleasure."" Jeanne caught those words before she made her exit, leaving them alone. As the door closed, Nadina's smile shifted subtly. ""Despite our shared background, let us refrain from speaking Russian,"" she suggested. ""Neither of us are fluent in the language, after all,"" her companion concurred.",1
"She resembled Cinderella, youthful but consumed by a craving for dark thrills, for excitement at all costs, disregarding decency and empathy. Despite the allure of her beauty, I couldn't shake my initial disapproval and aversion. Thoughts of my deceased mother flooded my mind. What would she think of this peculiar, modern version of girlhood? The painted pretty face masking a sinister mind within. ""Get off your pedestal,"" the woman interjected abruptly. ""And drop the pretentious act.""",1
"""As we rushed to the Magnificent in a taxi, I pondered the intricacies of the plan. The 'full moon' ruse was quite ingenious, diverting our attention to Friday and leaving us vulnerable earlier. Poirot seemed unfazed, his usual composure returning swiftly. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for him - failure was not something he took lightly. 'Don't worry,' I reassured him. 'There's always another chance.' Upon arrival at the Magnificent, we were promptly led to the manager's office.""",1
"“My word, wasn’t it the elderly woman poisoned in Essex?” I confirmed. “That marked Poirot’s initial major investigation. Without a doubt, he prevented the killer from getting away unpunished. Truly remarkable detective work.” As I delved deeper into the details, leading up to the satisfying and surprising conclusion, the young woman was captivated by the story. So engrossed were we that we arrived at Calais station without even noticing. “Good heavens!” exclaimed my fellow traveler.",1
"During our brief encounter, it was evident that he was a coward at heart. Without delay, I saw the fear in his eyes as we locked gazes. With little effort, I coerced him into revealing his involvement in the robbery scheme and disclosed that Anita Grünberg was his estranged wife. Their paths had crossed with mine at a hotel dinner, where my unexpected presence had shaken him to the core after believing me to be dead. Despite marrying young, Anita had grown distant from him over time.",1
"I didn’t believe his idea was very clever, but the jury seemed eager to leave and happy to declare the death an accident instead of suicide. “I find it quite odd,” the coroner remarked, “that the initial doctor did not step forward. His details should have been recorded immediately. It was highly irregular not to do so.” I smirked inwardly. I had my suspicions about the doctor. With that in mind, I decided to pay a visit to Scotland Yard soon. However, the following day held a shock.",1
"I must admit that after the first jolt of the Kilmorden, I quickly retreated below deck. A kind stewardess took me in, recommending dry toast and ginger ale. For three days, I remained confined to my cabin, consumed by misery. My passion for solving mysteries had vanished, leaving behind a shell of the once eager Anne who had rushed to South Kensington. Now, as I reflect on my return, I can't help but smile at the memory of Mrs. Flemming in the drawing-room, waiting to speak with me.",1
"""Given his urgent demeanor, I promptly presented his card, identifying him as Mr. Roger Havering,"" she said, handing me the slip of paper. Poirot directed me to the bookcase, where I retrieved ""Who's Who."" After scanning the pages, he noted, ""Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb."" ""Ah,"" I mused. ""I believe she was the actress at the Frivolity, though she went by Zoe Carrisbrook. I recall her marrying a young socialite before the War.""",1
"""I can't wait to ditch him in Cape Town,"" she said. ""He's staying?"" ""Yes, he'll have a blast playing detective after Rayburn. It's right up Pagett's alley. He loves a good mystery. But I'm serious about my invitation. Will you join us? Mrs. Blair will be there to chaperone, and you can take breaks to explore."" ""Thank you, Sir Eustace,"" I replied, ""but I think I'm heading to Durban tonight."" ""Don't be stubborn. Remember, there are plenty of lions in Rhodesia. You'll enjoy the lions.""",1
"""I wonder where his plan to deceive me will lead? A woman's hair, hmm!"" The meal was satisfying, yet Poirot seemed preoccupied and distant. Later, in our room, I pressed him to share details of his enigmatic trip to Paris. ""Of course, mon ami. I journeyed to Paris for this."" He produced a faded newspaper clipping from his pocket, displaying a woman's photograph. I gasped. ""You know her, my friend?"" I nodded, recognizing the unmistakable likeness despite the dated style of the photo.",1
"Poirot and Japp were discussing the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Davenheim. The conversation turned to the possibility of Mr. Davenheim hiding in plain sight, with Poirot suggesting that he might be hiding in a prison. This revelation shocked both Japp and Hastings, as they realized that Mr. Davenheim's clever plan involved creating a false identity as Billy Kellett to throw off the police. It was a brilliant scheme that kept everyone fooled until Poirot saw through the disguise.",1
"The message read: “The sacred diamond, the god's eye, must be returned to its origin.” The next letter repeated the same demand, while the third one was direct: “You have defied the warning. Now, the diamond will be taken from you. When the full moon shines, both diamonds will reunite. It is fate.” Miss Marvell recounted, “I dismissed the initial note as a prank. The second one gave me pause. The third, received yesterday, left me uneasy. The situation is graver than I anticipated.”",1
"""Evidently, he was correct!” With tears welling up, she bid us a composed goodbye. Poirot, walking alongside me, made his usual gesture. “Well, that settles it! Let's return to London, my dear friend, as it seems there is no mystery to solve here. But” “But what?” “Just a small inconsistency, nothing more! Did you catch it? No? Nonetheless, discrepancies are common in life, and certainly the man did not commit suicide, as there is no poison that would result in blood in his mouth.""",1
"""There was a subtle shift in his attitude towards me. 'I have an update for you. Your boyfriend is on his way. He'll arrive shortly. Keep your emotions in check, I have more to tell you. You tried to trick me this morning. I advised you to be honest, and initially you complied. But then you veered off course. You tried to convince me that the diamonds were with Harry Rayburn. I went along with it at first because it made it easier for me to persuade you to lure Harry Rayburn here.""",1
"Hunter’s Lodge is managed by a housekeeper who efficiently handles all our needs during our occasional weekend visits. When the shooting season arrives, we bring along some of our own servants from Newmarket.

He never had a good relationship with my father or my elder brother, but I suspect that my somewhat rebellious nature only strengthened his fondness for me.",1
"I scoured every corner, feeling increasingly frustrated. After slamming shut the final book, it became clear - Kilmorden Castle was nowhere to be found. This discovery was perplexing. Who would fabricate such a location and jot it down on paper? Ridiculous! Another possibility dawned on me. Maybe it was a pretentious mansion on the outskirts, adorned with a grandiose name coined by its wealthy owner. However, if that were the case, locating it would prove to be quite the challenge.",1
"Renauld left his tattered coat and pants in the shed, avoiding bringing them inside the house. To support Madame Renauld's story, they cruelly stabbed him with an airplane dagger. That evening, Mr. Renauld tied up his wife and silenced her, then proceeded to dig a grave in the precise location where he planned to build a shelter. It was crucial for the corpse to be discovered without raising any doubts for Madame Daubreuil. Waiting a while would reduce the risk of being identified.",1
"""Having assumed I was alone on the boat deck, I was surprised to see another figure gazing out at the city. I instantly recognized him before he even turned around. The events of last night felt surreal in the calm morning light. What did he think of me? The words I had spoken made me cringe with embarrassment. Did I truly mean them? I quickly averted my gaze, focusing intently on Table Mountain. If Rayburn sought solitude up here, I would not intrude by making my presence known.""",1
"""His persuasion led me to switch allegiance."" Sir Eustace glanced his way. He remained silent, yet Minks appeared to visibly crumble. ""Rats deserting a sinking ship,"" noted Sir Eustace. ""I despise rats. Sooner or later, I exterminate pests."" ""There's something I must disclose, Sir Eustace,"" I interjected. ""The tin you tossed out the window didn't hold the diamonds. It contained ordinary pebbles. The diamonds are securely hidden. In truth, they reside in the large giraffe's belly.""",1
"“I agreed silently. “So, what about the murder weapon?” “I have an idea, Captain Hastings. There were two revolvers that belonged to my husband displayed on the wall. One is now gone. I informed the authorities about this, and they confiscated the remaining one. Once they retrieve the bullet, the truth should come to light.” “Can I visit the gun-room?” “Of course. The police have already searched it. However, the body has been taken away.” She led me to the location of the murder.",1
"""Maître Grosíer stood up abruptly, declaring: “My client is under immense stress. I must emphasize that his words should not be taken as his final statement.” The magistrate silenced him with a stern look. Doubt flickered in his eyes momentarily. Jack Renauld's performance was almost too convincing. Leaning in, he scrutinized the defendant closely. “Renauld, are you aware that based on your responses, I will have to send you to trial?” Jack's face turned red, his gaze unwavering.""",1
"""I asked, 'What were you doing at that hour? Why weren't you in bed like a good Christian?' I was annoyed. Pagett always managed to be on the right side of things, playing the martyr. 'I was finishing the cabling work, Sir Eustace, and updating the diary,' he replied. 'Go on,' I urged. 'I decided to take a walk before retiring, Sir Eustace. I saw a man heading towards your cabin, and something about him seemed off. He hurried up the stairs near the saloon, and I trailed behind.'""",1
"He was a villain, but a pleasant one. Sir Eustace's escape was not surprising. Colonel Race knew his real name was Harry Lucas, but he was actually John Harold Eardsley. Harry deceived Anne, but eventually confessed the truth to her. Anne realized the discrepancies in his story and struggled with her feelings towards him. Harry wanted to live a simple life with Anne, away from his father's wealth. In the end, he revealed his true identity to Anne, feeling jealous of Colonel Race.",1
"Rayburn was taken aback by the sight of Guy Pagett. ""Pagett,"" he mumbled in disbelief. Rayburn seemed shocked by the revelation, but I couldn't help feeling a bit smug. ""You look like you've seen a ghost,"" I remarked. Rayburn's eyes narrowed. ""What's your role in all this? How much have you figured out?"" I flashed a knowing smile. ""Let's just say I know more than you think, Rayburn."" His grip on my arm tightened, his voice trembling as he demanded, ""Where did you hear that name?""",1
"""His name is John Eardsley,"" Colonel Race announced abruptly before walking away. I watched him leave, feeling a mix of emotions. Harry's voice broke through my thoughts, pleading for forgiveness. As he reached out to hold my hand, I instinctively pulled away. ""Why did you lie to me?"" I asked, my voice tinged with hurt. ""I was scared that you would only care about the wealth and power that came with me. I wanted you to love me for who I am, stripped of all the superficialities.""",1

I paused for a moment, deep in thought. ""I wonder how Sir Eustace accumulated his wealth."" ""Are you suspecting him once more?"" ""Suzanne, I've reached a point where suspicion comes naturally! I'm not truly suspecting him, but he is Pagett's boss, and he was the previous owner of the Mill House.""",1
"“Mr. Hautet, I swear I am innocent of my father’s murder,” protested the accused. The magistrate’s fleeting uncertainty vanished as he let out a mocking chuckle. “Innocent they always claim to be, our prisoners! Your words alone condemn you. No defense, no alibi, just a feeble denial. You thought the money would be yours after his death, so you killed Renauld in a cold, calculated manner. Your mother, an accomplice, may receive leniency for her maternal instincts, but not you.”",1
"Hautet pondered. “It seems somewhat unjust to leave the son at the mercy of his mother, should she remarry and her new husband gain control. The boy may never see a cent of his father’s wealth.” Poirot simply raised an eyebrow. “Humans are prideful creatures. Perhaps M. Renauld assumed his widow would remain single. And entrusting the money to his son's mother could have been a calculated move. Wealthy heirs are often known to be reckless.” “Your theory could hold true. Now, M.",1
"""Absolutely marvelous!"" whispered Poirot. ""Certainly a top-notch love story."" He glanced at Mary Marvell. ""And are you not scared, madam? No superstitions haunting you? Not a hint of fear in introducing these Siamese twins to each other in case a Chinese man emerges and, presto! whisks them away to China?"" Though his voice was teasing, I sensed a hint of gravity beneath. ""I highly doubt Lady Yardly's diamond compares to mine,"" Miss Marvell declared. ""But I intend to find out.""",1
"""Apologies, Hastings, I need a brief walk."" Upon his return, after roughly an hour, his eyes sparkled with an unusual excitement. He placed his cane on the table, meticulously tending to his hat's nap before speaking. ""Luckily, my friend, we have no pressing matters. Let us focus entirely on this current inquiry."" ""And what inquiry might that be?"" ""The astonishing affordability of Mrs. Robinson's recent apartment."" ""Poirot, you can't be serious!"" ""Oh, but I am deadly serious.""",1
"""Baker was sent to the neighboring town to get two printed will-forms by Mr. Marsh. They signed one, but he made a mistake and had them sign again later that day. After signing the second time, Mr. Marsh went out to pay tradesmen's books. There were workmen from a Plymouth firm who had been in the house two years ago for repairs, but they couldn't remember the details. Poirot suspected a second will and a hiding place, so they decided to go to Plymouth to investigate further.""",1
"But there was no assurance in reality that Anna the Adventuress wouldn't meet a sudden end at the conclusion of any Episode. I found myself in a difficult situation. The words Rayburn had spoken that morning echoed in my mind. ""Tell the truth,"" he had urged. But would it make any difference? Would anyone believe my account? How could they possibly accept that I embarked on this crazy journey based solely on a musty scrap of paper? It all sounded like a far-fetched story to me.",1
"""He attempted to flee, but I was one step ahead. He's now in custody for the killing of his father, M. Paul Renauld."" Poirot turned sharply towards the young man, who was slouched against the wall, his complexion drained of color. ""Any words, jeune homme?"" Jack Renauld gazed back at him expressionless. ""None,"" he replied. I was taken aback. Until that moment, I couldn't accept Jack Renauld's guilt. I anticipated a vehement denial of the accusations when Poirot confronted him.",1
"""I have no inheritance for you in my will,"" he declared, ""but with each passing year, consider this your safety net for when I depart."" Poirot pondered. ""And what did Mr. Marsh do after you signed for the second time? Any idea?"" ""He went to the village to settle debts with the local tradesmen."" Poirot shifted his approach. Extending the desk key, he inquired, ""Does this match your employer's handwriting?"" There was a brief pause before Baker responded, ""Indeed, sir, it does.""",1
"""We chatted casually for a while. “Miss Beddingfeld, it seems I crossed paths with your father before. He was quite a fascinating man, and his area of expertise is something I find particularly intriguing. I've dabbled in a similar field myself. Back when I was in Dordogne” Our conversation shifted to a more specialized tone. Colonel Race's knowledge was impressive. Yet, he unexpectedly made a couple of errors in his explanations, almost as if they were intentional slip-ups.""",1
"""I've behaved foolishly in various ways, Monsieur Poirot. I am deeply in debt but I am determined to turn things around. I care for the children and I aim to resolve my issues so we can continue living in our home. Gregory Rolf has presented me with a lucrative opportunity that could help me get back on track. I am hesitant, as I despise the idea of participating in the pretentious activities at the Chase, but I may not have a choice,"" He paused, meeting Poirot's sharp gaze.",1
"""Just as I was starting to lose track of time, a barely audible scratching noise caught my attention. Poirot subtly signaled me and we silently made our way towards the hallway where the sound was originating. Poirot whispered to me, ""Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the signal, seize him from behind and restrain him. Watch out, he may be armed."" Soon enough, a tearing sound filled the air and a small beam of light pierced through the door.""",1
"""The possibility of Ridgeway being the thief crossed my mind,"" Poirot mused aloud. ""It would have added a touch of elegance to the case, a display of meticulous planning. However, it may not have been as delightful for Miss Farquhar."" I interjected, unable to contain my curiosity any longer. Poirot, sensing my eagerness, proceeded to analyze the situation. The sealed package had mysteriously disappeared from the trunk, leaving no trace behind, much to Miss Farquhar's dismay.",1
"I awoke from troubled dreams once more, desperate to find Harry Rayburn and warn him of some unknown danger. As I regained consciousness, memories of the nightmarish ordeal flooded back to me - the hurried escape from the hotel, the mysterious figure in the shadows, and the terrifying sensation of falling. Miraculously, I had survived the ordeal, though I was battered and weak. As I struggled to move, I realized I was confined in a cramped room with walls made of rough wood.",1
"I received a message from Suzanne upon the birth of her child: “Congrats and love to the newest addition to Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to let Suzanne get away with that. I responded with a single word, concise and direct: “Platycephalic!” There is a popular story about a writer who sought to start his tale in a striking and unique manner to captivate even the most jaded of editors, writing: “‘Hell!’ exclaimed the Duchess.",1
"Poirot carefully examined the dagger that had been removed from the wound, now resting in a glass jar beside the body. His eyes gleamed with excitement as he observed the lack of blood and stains on the clothes. ""This wound is strange,"" he remarked. ""The blade of the dagger is discoloured, but the man was stabbed after he was dead."" As the voices around him grew louder, Poirot silenced them with a gesture and turned to Giraud, ""M. le docteur, what are your thoughts on this?""",1
"We followed the directions given to us, leading us to a grand mansion nestled in the hills. The sprawling estate overlooked the city below, a stark contrast to the rundown buildings we had passed through earlier. As we approached the entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows, catching us by surprise. It was a woman, her expression unreadable as she studied us with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. We knew we were in the right place, but the real mystery was just beginning.",1
"""At a loss for answers, I complied. Transportation options in Elmer's Dale were scarce. The rundown local garage housed a pair of beat-up Ford cars, along with two station wagons. None of these had been used on the day of interest. Mrs. Havering disclosed that she had provided the woman with funds for a trip to Derbyshire and enough for a car or station wagon to transport her to Hunter's Lodge. Typically, one of the Fords was available at the station in case it was needed.""",1
"As a crime novelist, I have always been intrigued by the complexity of human nature. One day, a mysterious woman approached me with a proposition that could change everything. She spoke in a language that was foreign to me, yet I couldn't help but be drawn in by her enigmatic presence. Despite her worldly-wise exterior, there was a hint of innocence in her eyes that I couldn't ignore. It was as if she was playing a dangerous game, one that I couldn't resist being a part of.",1
"Each man had his own theory. Poirot was uncharacteristically silent, his face reflecting a childlike confusion. I chatted with Norman, who I found quite entertaining. Upon reaching Dover, Poirot's behavior filled me with amusement. As we boarded the boat, he grasped my arm tightly. The wind howled loudly. ""Mon Dieu!"" he whispered. ""This is dreadful!"" ""Stay strong, Poirot,"" I reassured him. ""You will prevail. I believe in you."" ""Ah, my friend, you misunderstand my feelings.""",1
"His accomplices may have used a different method to incapacitate him, for example, they could have threatened him with a weapon instead. The Police Inspector and Major Norman discuss the possibility that the Prime Minister might have been kidnapped rather than escaped. They decide to return to England to investigate further. Poirot explains that the Prime Minister was kidnapped on his way to London, and a clever scheme involving a fake double was used to deceive the public.",1
"Hurriedly following his precise instructions, I found myself alone in my sleeping quarters, my belongings neatly stowed away. With the clock ticking towards departure, Paggett had failed to anticipate Suzanne's intervention. ""Prepare for a scorching journey ahead,"" she warned. ""Do you have any eau-de-Cologne or lavender water handy?"" My response was immediate. ""Oh no, I must have left it behind at the hotel,"" I lamented, playing my part in Suzanne's orchestration of events.",1
"""Can't you provide any more information about him?"" he asked, as I prepared to leave. ""Actually,"" I replied. I took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a final blow. ""His head was notably brachycephalic. He won't be able to change that easily."" I was pleased to see Inspector Meadow's pen hesitate. It was obvious he was unsure how to spell brachycephalic. Fueled by anger, my next move surprisingly felt effortless. I had a vague plan in mind when I entered Scotland Yard.",1
"""Indeed, he did not object to me joining Sir Eustace on the boat. He was not ready to be caught just yet. It appeared that Nadina did not bring the jewels to the rendezvous as planned, and Carton might be the one concealing them on the Kilmorden Castle. They were hoping I had a clue to their location. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not retrieve the diamonds, he remained in danger and was desperate to get them back. Where Carton hid them, if he did, remained a mystery to me.""",1
"“Just a bluff. No clue where she’s hiding.” “She sounded pretty sure.” “Probably. I’ve checked it out, we’re in the clear. And it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ call. You wouldn’t want to disobey, right?” The Dutchman muttered something in his native tongue. I assumed it was a quick denial. “Why not just get rid of her?” he snarled. “Easy enough. The boat is ready. We could take her out to sea?” “Agreed,” Chichester pondered. “That’s the way to go. She’s a liability, no doubt about it.",1
"""The ground floor windows are all secured with iron shutters,” the commissary argued. Poirot gestured towards a first floor window. “Isn't that the bedroom window we just left? Look, there's a tree nearby that would make for an easy climb.” “That's true,” the commissary acknowledged. “But they couldn't have climbed without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I understood his point. Two oval flower-beds, filled with scarlet geraniums, flanked the steps to the front door.",1
"She had a subtle dimple in her round chin and her half parted lips held a mysterious smile. There was an exaggeratedly feminine quality about her, both yielding and seductive. Despite being well preserved, she was no longer young, yet her charm transcended age. Dressed in black with fresh white collar and cuffs, hands clasped together, she appeared appealing and helpless. ""You wanted to see me, sir?"" she inquired. ""Indeed, madam,"" responded Mr. Hautet, clearing his throat.",1
"Suzanne's enthusiasm was lacking, having traveled extensively. She was not one to get excited before breakfast. When I expressed my excitement at spotting a giant blue convolvulus, she snubbed me harshly. Just to clarify, this story will not be set in South Africa. I won't promise any authentic local color with italicized words on every page. While I admire it, I simply cannot replicate it. In the South Sea Islands, however, a mention of bêche-de-mer is always appropriate.",1
"A large chintz-covered sofa sat against the far wall, while the window seats were also adorned with the same old-fashioned pattern. ""Well, my friend,"" Poirot stated, lighting a small cigarette, ""we need to strategize our next move. I've already examined the house, but I believe the key clue lies within this room. Our task will be to carefully review the documents in the desk. The will may not be there, but a seemingly ordinary paper could hold the secret to its location.""",1
"I struggled against the grip on my throat, biting and scratching in the most approved feminine fashion. The man had to keep me from crying out, hindering his movements. Despite my efforts, I felt myself weakening. Sensing this, my assailant put out all his strength. Suddenly, another shadow appeared, running on swift noiseless feet. With one powerful blow, he sent my opponent crashing to the deck. Finally released, I fell back against the rail, feeling sick and trembling.",1
"Poirot sat calmly reading his mail. Among the usual requests, a peculiar letter caught his attention. It was a plea for help from a man in France, fearing for his life. The urgency of the situation was evident in the hastily scrawled postscript, begging Poirot to come quickly. Intrigued by the mystery, Poirot wasted no time in making plans to travel to France to meet this desperate man in need of his detective skills. The clock was ticking, and there was no time to waste.",1
"That evening, Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a man, who refused to give his name, wanted to speak with me privately. Wary of insurance agents, I instructed Jarvis to turn him away. Guy Pagett, typically reliable, was unfortunately unwell with a bilious attack. It seemed that the hard-working young men often fell victim to such ailments. When Jarvis returned, he revealed, ""The man says he is here on behalf of Mr. Milray."" This unexpected connection changed everything.",1
"""New York!"" ""Lucy,"" I replied, ""soon you'll be tired of California and excitement."" ""I could use a fancy new pair of shoes,"" Lucy confessed longingly. ""Should I join you to see Jack Thompson tomorrow?"" ""I'd rather go by myself. He's more comfortable talking one-on-one,"" I explained. And that's how I found myself outside the cafe the next day, wrestling with an uncooperative umbrella that just wouldn't open, while Lucy lounged on the sofa with a magazine and a cup of tea.",1
"All I could think was, 'What's the point?' My friend was gone, with no one left to mourn him. I was meant to be gone too, so let it be. Living a quiet life now, devoid of joy or sorrow, numbed to the core. Looking back, I realize the war played a part in that. ""But then, out of nowhere, something jolted me back to reality. Guiding a group onto my boat for a river trip, I stood at the dock assisting them when one of the passengers gasped in shock. It drew my gaze to him.""",1
"Lord Yardly was shocked to see the diamond known as ""The Star of the East."" Poirot assured him that it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen in order to preserve it. Poirot then revealed that the diamond was originally in the possession of Mr. Rolf, who had been blackmailing Lady Yardly. Rolf had substituted a fake diamond for the real one, and orchestrated a double robbery to cover his tracks. Lady Yardly played her part in the robbery by pretending to be a victim.",1
"Poirot and I quickly discussed the situation before he hurried away. I patted him on the back, acknowledging his success. ""They've revealed the hiding spot to you, haven't they? But you must send a wire to France immediately. Going in person will be too slow."" Poirot gave me a puzzled look. ""Some things, my friend, cannot be communicated through telegrams."" Just then, Major Norman came back with a Flying Corps officer, Captain Lyall, who would be flying Poirot to France.",1
"We made our way there on camels, the creatures kneeling patiently as we prepared to mount. Surrounding us were several boys, led by a talkative dragoman. I won't dwell on the sight of Poirot on a camel. His journey began with groans and ended with screams, gestures, and prayers to the Virgin Mary and all the saints. Eventually, he gave up and traveled the rest of the way on a small donkey. I have to say, riding a trotting camel is no laughing matter. I was sore for days.",1
"""A shadow flickered across the actress's face as she responded stiffly: ""I'm sorry, but that's not possible."" ""Do you have it on you, hmm?"" Poirot observed her closely. The young woman paused briefly, then reached into the neckline of her dress, pulling out a slender chain. Leaning forward, she opened her hand. Nestled in her palm was a dazzling white gem, expertly placed in a platinum setting, gleaming solemnly at us. Poirot gasped softly. ""Magnificent!"" he whispered.""",1
"""Always I made sure of it myself."" ""And last evening?"" ""I secured it just like always."" ""You are certain of that?"" ""I vow it by the saints, sir."" ""What time was that?"" ""The usual time, half-past ten, sir."" ""And the others in the household, had they retired?"" ""Madame had gone to bed earlier. Denise and Léonie accompanied me upstairs. Monsieur was still in his study."" ""So, if anyone unlocked the door later, it must have been M. Renauld himself?"" Françoise simply shrugged.",1
"""I truly believe so.” “They might have eloped,” I said, trying to calm the situation, even though I knew it was a foolish suggestion. But in a place like this, where would they go? I kept rambling, unsure of how much longer I could keep it up, until Race suddenly entered the room. I had been somewhat correct - he had been out for a walk, but Anne was not with him. My approach to the situation was completely off. Race quickly had the entire hotel in chaos within minutes.",1
"""I've kept quiet for years, knowing I had this weapon in reserve. But now things have changed. I want my price, and it won't come cheap. It's quite a staggering amount,"" she declared. ""Incredible,"" the Count remarked. ""Do you really carry these diamonds with you at all times?"" His gaze swept across the messy room. Nadina chuckled softly. ""Don't assume anything. I'm not that foolish. The diamonds are hidden in a secure location where no one would think to look for them.""",1
"""Look at how 'Peerage' has been rearranged! The tallest books on the top shelf, the next tallest below, and so on. Order and method, as I always say, Hastings."" ""Exactly,"" I quickly replied, placing the book back in its proper place. Lord Yardly, a cheerful and boisterous sportsman with a red face, exuded a friendly charm that made up for any lack of intellect. ""Quite the puzzling situation, Monsieur Poirot. My wife and Miss Marvell have been receiving strange letters.""",1
"An incident quickly unfolded that deeply impacted the public consciousness. Suddenly, Sir John Willard passed away from a heart attack. Sensational tabloids wasted no time in resurrecting eerie tales linked to the cursed Egyptian artifacts. Despite the British Museum's dismissal, the infamous Mummy was once again thrust into the spotlight. Just two weeks later, Mr. Bleibner succumbed to lethal blood poisoning, followed shortly by his nephew's tragic suicide in New York.",1
"As I made my way to Villa Geneviève, my mood soured by the unsatisfactory turn of events, I opted for the solitude of the small bench near the shed. Lost in my thoughts, I was suddenly startled by the sound of approaching voices. It was not until the voices drew closer that I realized they were not from the garden I sat in, but from the neighboring Villa Marguerite. Amongst the voices, I distinguished the melodious tone of Marthe, the beautiful girl I knew all too well.",1
"He raged against the porters, the waiters at breakfast, the entire hotel staff. He probably wanted to unleash his fury on Miss Pettigrew too, but even Sir Eustace wouldn't dare. She was like a character straight out of a novel, always with her pencil and pad ready. I barely managed to save our giraffe from his wrath. Sir Eustace seemed ready to crush him. As for our mission, once Sir Eustace withdrew, Miss Pettigrew volunteered to stay behind just in case he needed her.",1
"We had planned to attend the Sunday concert, followed by an afternoon out, and then a nap after a hearty dinner of England le rosbif. These activities were meant to divert attention from Hercule Poirot's investigations. As we entered the crude wooden contraption, I hesitated. ""Are we breaking into the flat?"" I inquired cautiously. Poirot's response did little to ease my concerns: ""Not today,"" he said cryptically. With a tug on the rope, we descended to the second floor.",1
"""Miss Marsh, do you have the will or a copy of it on hand?"" Poirot asked, accepting the document she handed him. After a quick review, he noted, ""This was made three years ago, on March 25 at 11 a.m. The timing is quite telling and limits our search. We must now look for another will. Even a will made just half-an-hour later would change everything. Well, mademoiselle, you have brought me a charming and clever problem to solve. I look forward to unraveling it for you.""",1
"""The chauffeur, surprised by the attack, slammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister leaned out of the window. Without warning, two shots were fired. The first one barely missed his cheek, the second, thankfully, missed altogether. The chauffeur, understanding the peril, quickly sped forward, dispersing the group of assailants.""""A close call,"" I exclaimed, feeling a chill. ""Mr. MacAdam brushed off the minor injury he sustained. He insisted it was just a superficial cut.""",1
"A big sedan is parked on the deserted street, looking like it's having mechanical issues. The driver waves for O’Murphy to pull over. As O’Murphy decelerates, the stranger comes closer. Daniels sticks his head out of the window, and, likely using a fast-acting anesthetic like ethyl chloride, executes the chloroform scheme once more. In no time, the two vulnerable men are hauled out and switched to a different vehicle, while two replacements seamlessly take their spots.",1
"Madame Beroldy was a young and attractive woman, known for her charismatic personality. Rumors circulated about her mysterious background, with some claiming she was the illegitimate child of a Russian Grand Duke while others insisted it was an Austrian Archduke. Despite the speculation, Madame Beroldy neither confirmed nor denied the stories when questioned. Her presence in the quarter caused quite a commotion, leaving many intrigued by the enigma that surrounded her.",1
"The wind howled outside, sending chills down my spine. With a creak, the door to the room swung open, causing her to gasp in fear. ""This door must be cursed!"" exclaimed Poirot, frustration evident in his voice. He rose to shut it firmly, securing it with a key. ""I will lock it like this!"" ""Please don't,"" she whispered, her voice filled with dread. But before she could finish, the unthinkable occurred. The locked door creaked open slowly, as if moved by an unseen force.",1
""" A dramatic gesture was made by her. “Undoubtedly, M. Stonor, the secretary, assisted her. They are closely connected, those two. Though she is older than him, what do men care about if a woman is wealthy!” There was bitterness in her voice. “Stonor claimed to be in England,” I mentioned. “He claims so, but who can be certain?” “Mademoiselle,” Poirot spoke calmly, “for us to collaborate effectively, we must establish some things. To begin, I have a question for you.""",1
"""Back in the day, men and women were equals. Papa used to say they roamed the world together like lions and tigers,"" Colonel Race chimed in with a smirk, ""And giraffes?"" I couldn't help but laugh at the mention of giraffes. ""Yes, giraffes too. They were nomads, you know. It wasn't until they settled in communities that women's strength waned. Deep down, we're all the same. Women still admire physical strength in men because it's what they once possessed and now lack.""",1
"""I don't want to point fingers, but the murder did take place in Sir Eustace's home,"" Anne said. Suzanne replied, ""I'll keep an eye on him for you, Anne. If he starts looking any plumper and happier, I'll send you a telegram right away. 'Sir E. expanding. Very suspicious. Immediate action required.'""Anne protested, ""Suzanne, this is not a game!""Suzanne shrugged, ""To me, it is. Blame yourself, Anne. Your sense of adventure has rubbed off on me. It all feels so unreal.""",1
"“We gratefully accepted her offer of something to eat, hoping our presence might distract her from her grief. Just as we finished our soup, a scream and the sound of breaking crockery startled us. The parlourmaid rushed in, her hand clutching her heart. “There was a man in the passage,” she gasped. Poirot quickly investigated, but found no one there. “Are you sure?” the maid whispered weakly. “It truly gave me a fright!” “But why?” Poirot inquired, lowering his voice.",1
"As he took a step back, he seemed to involuntarily retreat from an unseen threat, unaware that he was teetering on the edge of the platform. In an instant, he tumbled over the side. A bright flash emanated from the tracks followed by a sharp crackling noise, prompting a scream to escape my lips. The commotion drew a crowd as two station employees swiftly appeared, assuming control of the situation. I stood frozen in place, held captive by a chilling sense of intrigue.",1
"I was lounging in my room when Blair phoned to remind me of my plans for the afternoon. He seemed surprised that Suzanne had reached out to me, and I couldn't help but wish she had. ""Enough of this,"" he snapped, standing up. ""What do you intend to do with me?"" I tried to maintain my calm demeanor as I inquired. ""I'll make sure you're out of the way in case your associates try to intervene,"" he responded. My heart skipped a beat, but his following words put me at ease.",1
"Nadina, the famous Russian dancer, received praise from the audience in Paris. As she left the stage, the Manager greeted her warmly. Later, Count Sergius Paulovitch visited her and they spoke in English about espionage suspicions and the retiring 'Colonel.' The Count mentioned a fortune-teller's prophecy about the 'Colonel's' downfall involving a woman, which intrigued Nadina. She revealed her plan to go to London incognito, leaving everyone unaware of her departure.",1
"Poirot's brow furrowed as he mulled over the letter from Bella found in the dead man's pocket. The magistrate suggested reaching out to the police in Santiago for more information about the victim's past. Noticing the legacy left in the will to the secretary, Poirot speculated on the implications. The mention of the date on the will hinted at a possible premonition of danger, revealing a complex web of relationships that could shed light on the mysterious murder case.",1
"The valet was surprised by the card's quality in Mr. Opalsen's possession. Poirot expressed his gratitude before the valet left, casting a curious look at the mess in the room. Poirot mused aloud about the heavily insured necklace as he tidied up the papers. ""And the necklace was heavily insured..."" I exclaimed, but Poirot shut me down. ""You see nothing, my friend,"" he retorted. ""As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us go back to our rooms.""",1
"There, using an alias, he gets married and eventually amasses a large fortune in South America. Despite his success, he feels a longing for his homeland after two decades.

Settling in England with plans to summer in France, he unknowingly ends up in Merlinville, where fate catches up to him.",1
"""It's strange, don't you think? Could it be haunted?"" ""Haunted flat? Never heard of such a thing,"" Parker stated firmly. ""No,"" Mrs. Robinson seemed skeptical. ""But there were some odd things that caught my attention."" ""Like what?"" I inquired. ""Ah,"" Parker chimed in, ""our expert in crime is intrigued! Share your thoughts with him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is skilled at unraveling mysteries."" I chuckled, feeling awkward yet slightly flattered by the role assigned to me.",1
"""Poirot agreed to join Lady Yardly and the children, quickly forming a bond with them. They played together and even managed to pull me into the fun. “You are a good mother,” Poirot complimented Lady Yardly, as the children were taken away by their nurse. Lady Yardly fixed her hair and confessed, “I adore them,” her voice filled with emotion. “And they adore you as well!” Poirot remarked. The sound of a dressing-gong signaled that it was time to retire to our rooms.""",1
"Poirot greeted all our acquaintances before diving into his investigation. Unlike Giraud, Poirot paid little attention to the room itself, focusing instead on the worn-out garments near the entrance. Giraud smirked at Poirot's seemingly lackadaisical approach, but Poirot quickly dismissed the clothing as belonging to the gardener. Kneeling beside the victim, Poirot meticulously inspected the fabric of the attire, ensuring there were no traces of evidence to be found.",1
"""Welcome back from England, M. Poirot,"" he said casually. ""The case is nearing its end, isn't it?"" Poirot nodded, his demeanor subdued. ""I believe so,"" he replied. The other man, clearly pleased with Poirot's demeanor, commented on the lack of resistance from the suspect. ""It is quite remarkable,"" Poirot agreed, his tone mild. But his companion was already preoccupied with his cane, bidding Poirot farewell and expressing satisfaction with the resolution of the case.",1
"I briefed Cinderella on how the discovery unfolded, and she paid close attention, occasionally posing insightful questions. We then headed towards the Villa, with me being cautious, not eager to encounter anyone. Leading the girl through the shrubbery to the rear of the house, where the small shed stood, I recalled that M. Bex had entrusted the key to Marchaud the previous evening. It was possible that the Sûreté detective had returned it to Marchaud after using it.",1
"""He was a man who once loved me,"" she said quietly. The Count raised an eyebrow, ""In South Africa?"" She nodded, confirming it as her native country. As her visitor prepared to leave, he warned her about underestimating the 'Colonel', suggesting he may be more dangerous than a mere disillusioned lover. She scoffed at the idea, confident in her knowledge of him. But as he left, his parting words lingered in the air, ""I wonder if you do? I very much wonder if you do.""",1

It was clear that once he discovered the truth, his feelings would turn to disgust. As for Giraud, his nerves got the best of him and he had to retreat back to Paris. Poirot's prediction proved to be accurate when Jack was finally ready to face reality, with Poirot guiding him through the harsh truth.""",1
"I doubt she'll ever give me an explanation. No one ever does. I'm always left to figure it out on my own. It gets old pretty quick. I guess it's all part of the journalist game. “Navigating the rapids,” according to our Special Correspondent. After putting away the telegram, I politely excused myself from my Government contact. While I'm not thrilled about the idea of going hungry, I'm not concerned for my safety. Smuts is more than equipped to handle any uprising.",1

And that's not all. ""Our reporter travels with the killer. Unveiling 'The Man in the Brown Suit.'"" The details were sent to South African papers, but I didn't revisit my own detailed reports until much later. Finally, I got the green light and detailed instructions via cable in Bulawayo.",1

The girl appeared uneasy, a fact not lost on Jack Renauld, who pulled her in closer and inquired, ""What troubles you, my love? What haunts you now?"" As she gazed back with the same fearful expression Poirot had mentioned, she whispered softly, almost revealing her thoughts, ""I fear for your safety.""",1
"""I meticulously reviewed the case once more, reaching the same conclusion as previously. If not Bella Duveen, then the only other suspect could be Marthe Daubreuil. Yet, I lacked any concrete evidence against her. ""But when you presented me with that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, I glimpsed an opportunity to finally resolve the issue. The initial dagger had been taken by Dulcie Duveen, cast into the sea under the mistaken belief that it belonged to her sibling.",1
"As we were still reeling from the doctor's bombshell, a telegram arrived at the Villa. It was a message from Poirot, informing me of his imminent return on the 12:28 train to Merlinville. With a quick glance at my watch, I realized I had just enough time to reach the station and greet him. It was crucial that Poirot be briefed on the latest shocking turn of events in the investigation. Clearly, he had wasted no time in obtaining the information he sought in Paris.",1
"""I find the South African climate to be quite delightful."" ""I'm aware of the climate, having been there just before the war."" ""Thank you, Pedler. I'll have the package sent to General Smuts directly. The Kilmorden Castle sets sail on Saturday, a reliable vessel."" We walked along Pall Mall together briefly before saying goodbye. He shook my hand warmly, expressing gratitude once more. As I made my way home, I pondered the intricate paths of governmental decisions.",1
"“Only stopping by for a brief visit, but it caught my interest. A minor detail, yet I thought it was worth looking into.” Poirot raised an eyebrow. M. Hautet agreed, with a hint of disappointment. “We have to accept the truth, I'm afraid. Giraud, uncouth as he may be, is undeniably clever! Slim chance of him slipping up.” “You don't believe so, M. le juge?” The magistrate simply shrugged. “Well, to be honest, between us, it's clear. Can you see it any other way?”",1
"I caught a glimpse of Table Mountain as the Kilmorden sailed into Table Bay. The morning sunlight bathed the town below, creating a magical sight. It took my breath away, filling me with a longing for something beautiful. The peaceful moment was interrupted by the presence of another figure on deck, absorbed in the view. I immediately recognized him. The events of the previous night seemed exaggerated in the light of day, making me feel a twinge of embarrassment.",1
"‘Is it possible for a man to shoot himself like this? Show me,’ he demands. Reluctantly, the foolish man obliges, placing the rifle in his mouth. She crouches, playfully touching the trigger, a mischievous smile on her face. ‘Well, sir,’ she teases, ‘what if I were to pull it?’ “And just like that, Hastings, she does!” In my documented cases, Poirot always begins with a central fact - murder or theft - and cleverly unravels the mystery through logical deduction.",1
"""I suspect that these footprints may hold the key to the case,"" M. Bex remained silent, offering only a slight shrug in response. ""Shall we continue?"" he inquired politely. ""Of course. I will look into the footprints further,"" Poirot replied cheerfully. Instead of proceeding down the driveway towards the gate, M. Bex veered onto a path that diverged to the right. The path ascended gently, curving around the side of the house, flanked by shrubbery on either side.",1
"In the dead of night, the thief made a swift escape under the cover of darkness. Lord Yardly promptly dispatched a footman to summon the police, while Lady Yardly, aided by Poirot, recounted her harrowing ordeal. ""I was about to switch on the lamp,"" she recounted shakily, ""when a man pounced on me from behind. He ripped my necklace off with such violence that I tumbled to the ground. In that moment, I caught a glimpse of him vanishing through the side entrance.""",1
"The gang could easily orchestrate such a simple matter. What use was there in protesting my innocence? Every detail would have been taken care of. Long ago, they had accused Harry Rayburn of stealing from De Beers, and he couldn't prove otherwise. I had no doubt he was innocent. What hope did I have against the ""Colonel's"" scheming? Glancing at the clock, another detail of the case caught my attention. Guy Pagett's watch had a significance that I now understood.",1
"The suspect in the theft of the papers, Luigi Valdarno, was found dead in New York with no papers on him. He had been associated with a mysterious woman, Miss Elsa Hardt, who vanished around the same time. The American Secret Service suspected her to be an international spy. Poirot and his companion kept watch in a flat and captured an Italian man attempting a break-in. They then led him to a house in St. John’s Wood, claiming that Poirot's wife needed a doctor.",1
"""As you did not provide me with an address, the letter was sent to me for forwarding,"" he clarified. Poirot examined the letter with interest. The handwriting, a woman's script, was long and slanted. Without opening it, he placed it in his pocket and stood up. ""Until tomorrow, M. le juge. Thank you for your kindness."" ""It is no trouble at all. I am here to assist you. These young detectives, followers of Giraud, they are all impolite and arrogant,"" he remarked.",1
"""Forgive my impulsiveness, Philip,"" she began. ""Allow me to present Monsieur Hercule Poirot, a name you surely recognize, and his companion, Captain Hastings."" Ridgeway appeared taken aback. ""I am familiar with your reputation, Monsieur Poirot,"" he acknowledged, shaking hands. ""But I never suspected Esmée would seek your assistance with our dilemma."" ""I feared you would object, Philip,"" Miss Farquhar admitted softly. ""Hence my precautions,"" he replied, smiling.",1
"“Françoise’s account appears to be accurate,” he confided in me. “I've been in touch with headquarters. It seems that in the past six weeks, ever since M. Renauld's arrival in Merlinville, Madame Daubreuil has deposited a significant amount of money into her bank account three times. The total sum adds up to two hundred thousand francs!” “My goodness,” I mused, “that's around four thousand pounds, isn't it?” “Exactly. It's clear that he was completely smitten.”",1
"I had uncovered a murder at Marlow that was not the work of a lone perpetrator. The revelations from Colonel Race to Suzanne, along with what I had eavesdropped on in Muizenberg, shed light on the organized crime syndicate I was up against. This ""Colonel"" had his followers intricately involved in various illegal activities. Memories of conversations on the ship about the Rand strike and suspicions of a covert organization manipulating events came flooding back.",1
"In the cases I have documented, Poirot's inquiries typically begin with a key fact, whether it be murder or theft, and advance from there through a series of logical deductions to the ultimate successful resolution. However, the incidents I am going to recount next were set in motion by a peculiar sequence of events that unfolded from seemingly insignificant occurrences that initially caught Poirot's eye to the dark events that concluded a highly unusual case.",1
"""In fact, a friend from the City tipped me off about a lucrative opportunity. With money to spare, I suggested a weekend getaway at the Grand Metropolitan would be just the ticket for us all."" ""Thank you, I graciously accept. Your kindness towards an old man is truly heartwarming. In the grand scheme of things, it's the kindness that truly matters. Sometimes, I forget that,"" I hesitated at the insinuation. Poirot seems to underestimate my intellect at times.""",1
"She carefully examined the portrait of Rev. Edward Chichester, tilting her head to the side. ""An excellent likeness. Now, onto the rest."" Handing me the paper, she inquired, ""Is that your stewardess?"" Excitedly, I confirmed, ""Yes, that's Suzanne. How did you know?"" She brushed off the praise. ""I've always been suspicious of Chichester. Remember how he reacted when we mentioned Crippen? And he attempted to claim Cabin 17!"" ""It's all coming together,"" I agreed.",1
"""Despite his subordinate role, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sir Eustace was heavily influenced by his secretary, Guy Pagett. Suzanne disagreed, insisting that the true mastermind, the elusive ""Colonel,"" was pulling the strings from afar. Sir Eustace's low profile may have been a deliberate choice, a way to avoid the spotlight. Perhaps his secretary's power was just a facade, a distraction from the real puppeteer lurking in the shadows, continents away.""",1
"""Six months."" ""You sure it's her? The woman I saw was tall, fair, with reddish-gold hair."" ""That's her,"" confirmed the porter. ""They arrived in the Michaelmas quarter, precisely six months back."" He lost interest and walked away. I followed Poirot outside. ""Well, Hastings?"" my friend asked with a smirk. ""Still think charming women are always honest?"" I stayed silent. As we walked down Brompton Road, I finally asked Poirot about his plan and our destination.",1
"I had a hunch early on that someone was exploiting the superstitious beliefs surrounding a series of deaths. The death of Sir John Willard seemed to trigger a frenzy of superstition, but it was Mr. Bleibner's murder that really caught my attention. Unlike Sir John, Mr. Bleibner was a wealthy man, making him a more likely target for foul play. My sources in New York provided some intriguing leads that pointed towards a more sinister motive behind the deaths.",1
"I retrieved the keys and made my way to the Mill House, satisfied with my reconstructions thus far. The discrepancies between the man described by Mrs. James and my Tube ""doctor"" were merely superficial. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. Although the ""doctor"" seemed middle-aged, his movements hinted at youthfulness. The victim of the accident (whom I dubbed the Moth Ball man) and the foreign woman, Mrs. James, were the focus of my investigation.",1
"The main reason we moved to Little Hampsly was the proximity to Hampsly Cavern, a hidden cave containing artifacts from the Aurignacian culture. In the village, we had a small Museum where the curator and my father would spend their days excavating remains of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. After a persistent cough, my father fell ill with a fever and quickly deteriorated. Despite the doctor's efforts, he succumbed to double pneumonia just four days later.",1
"""Every hen lays eggs of different sizes,"" he grumbled. ""No symmetry at the breakfast table. They should sort them properly."" Japp interrupted, ""Forget the eggs. Tell us where our customer went after leaving The Cedars."" Poirot replied, ""He went to his hiding place. Monsieur Davenheim's grey cells may have some malformation, but they are top-notch!"" Japp pressed, ""Do you know where he is hiding?"" Poirot confidently responded, ""Of course! It's quite clever.""",1
"“Within the sprawling estate of your late uncle, lies a hidden fortune in cash or perhaps a secret will, with a deadline of one year for you to uncover it.” “Indeed, Monsieur Poirot; I trust in your superior skills to succeed where I have failed.” “Ah, how kind of you. Rest assured, my mind is ready for the challenge. Have you searched for it at all?” “Just a quick look around; but I have faith in my uncle's cunning to make it a difficult puzzle to solve.""",1
"We returned to Crabtree Manor during the early hours of the morning. Ignoring the puzzled expressions of the Bakers, Poirot headed straight to the study. ""I may have been mistaken multiple times, but now I see clearly,"" he declared. Without hesitation, he unlocked the desk and removed an envelope. I watched in disbelief, wondering how a substantial will could fit inside such a small package. Methodically, he opened the envelope and spread out its contents.",1
"""As Graves feared being caught eavesdropping, he quickly went to carry out his employer's task. The two men had arrived promptly at eight that evening. Over dinner, they engaged in casual conversation about politics, weather, and the theater. After serving port and coffee, Graves' master unexpectedly granted him the rest of the evening off. The inspector inquired if this was a common occurrence with guests, to which Graves replied, 'No, sir; it was not.'""",1
"""It's a small, elegant spot nestled between Bolougne and Calais. Lately, it's been gaining popularity among wealthy Brits seeking tranquility. Does M. Renauld own property in England?"" ""Yes, in Rutland Gate, and a sizable estate in Hertfordshire. Not much is known about him socially. He's rumored to have significant business dealings in South America, primarily in Chile and Argentina."" ""We'll find out more from the man directly. Let's get ready to leave.""",1
"Daniels had been under surveillance for weeks. The evidence against him was piling up: the mysterious phone calls, the unexplained absences from work, the large sums of money appearing in his bank account. But there was one piece of the puzzle that didn't quite fit. Daniels had always been a loyal employee, never causing any trouble or raising any suspicions. Could it be possible that he was involved in something much darker than anyone had ever imagined?",1
"I lapsed back into silence, pondering my own thoughts. Mrs. Renauld's words to her son echoed in my mind, taking on a new meaning. ""So you did not sail?"" she had asked, then followed with, ""After all, it does not matter now."" What was the significance of her words? They were cryptic, yet revealing. Could it be that she was privy to more information than we had assumed? Despite her denial of any involvement in her husband's secretive mission for their son.",1
"I'll find the scoundrel and clear my name, or die trying. He tried to murder you cleverly, but I saw through his plan. Let me tell you the whole story, from the beginning. My real name is Harry Lucas and my father was a soldier in Rhodesia. Fate brought me to Young Eardsley, and together we found diamonds in British Guiana. Anita Grünberg came between us, a mystery we fell for. She betrayed us, and we lost everything. Now, I will seek justice for us both.",1
"""Was it Sir Eustace who underwent a test, or was the tale crafted for my benefit? I recalled feeling like I was being interrogated that night. Colonel Race seemed wary for some reason. But what was his involvement? ""Who exactly is Colonel Race?"" I inquired. ""That's a loaded question,"" Suzanne replied. ""He's famous as a big-game hunter and, as you heard him mention earlier, a distant relative of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I only just met him on this journey.""",1
"Poirot turned to us, his tone serious. ""Each criminal has his own method,"" he began, addressing us collectively. ""The police can often make a shrewd guess at the offender simply by the peculiar method he has employed."" Giraud, unimpressed, snorted at the suggestion of masked men. ""There have been many affairs,"" he retorted. ""These crimes all resemble each other more or less."" Poirot, undeterred, continued, ""There is such a thing as the individual touch.""",1
"“The voice on the phone was desperate. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor, they’ve killed me!’ Then it faded, leaving me shaken. ‘Who is this?’ I asked. ‘Who is this?’ A faint whisper replied, ‘Foscatine, Regent’s Court.’” The doctor gasped. “Count Foscatini! He lives in Regent’s Court. I must hurry. What could have transpired?” Poirot inquired, “One of your patients?” The doctor nodded, “I treated him recently for a minor ailment. An Italian, fluent in English.”",1
"He then commanded me abruptly to abandon any notion of marriage. He adamantly refused to approve of such a union. Irritated, I inquired about his objections to Mademoiselle Daubreuil. He had no valid explanation, only disparaging comments about the secretive past of the mother and daughter. I insisted that I was marrying Marthe, not her family history, but he silenced me with a firm rejection of any further discussion. The marriage was to be called off.",1
"I had always felt his animosity towards me. But now, the tables had turned. I was no longer the one in control, watching from the shadows. Fear began to creep in as I realized I was the target now. I had always been the obstacle in their grand plan, and I feared they would eliminate me without a second thought. Despite Harry Rayburn's past help, I knew the odds were stacked against me. Enemies lurked in every corner, closing in with each passing moment.",1
"I wasn't expecting that the seemingly unimportant note would lead to such a shocking discovery. The body of a woman found in a lonely house, strangled to death, added a whole new layer of mystery to the case. As the details unfolded, it became clear that there was more to this story than initially met the eye. The new development only heightened my curiosity, pushing me to delve deeper into the dark secrets that seemed to be lurking beneath the surface.",1
"""As we strolled down the scorching pavement, I felt compelled to address Poirot. ""I must admit, I have a bone to pick with you,"" I began, trying to maintain my composure. Poirot turned to me, a subtle look of curiosity in his eyes. ""And pray tell, how did you discover my visit to the Hôtel du Phare?"" he questioned. My cheeks flushed with irritation as I responded, ""I happened to glance inside as I walked by,"" trying to salvage some semblance of pride.""",1
"""Guy Pagett grimaced, ""This will certainly impact the constituency,"" he commented sadly. I can't understand why, but I trust Pagett's judgment in these situations. Logically, a Member of Parliament's abilities shouldn't diminish just because a young woman is found murdered in his vacant property. However, public perception is unpredictable. ""She's also a foreigner, which complicates things,"" Pagett added gloomily. Once again, I have to agree with him.""",1
"""I see,"" said Poirot thoughtfully. ""Perhaps we shall never know."" I felt a shiver run down my spine at the cryptic remark. Poirot always seemed to see more than he let on. As we walked down the dimly lit hallway, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something dark and sinister lurking just out of sight. The mystery of Mr. Renauld's murder was far from being solved, and I had a sinking feeling that things were about to get a lot more complicated.",1
"""We will go to meet Sir Guy Willard. He was eager to know when you would arrive,"" Dr. Tosswill informed us. Leading us through the camp, we reached a spacious tent. Dr. Tosswill opened the flap and we stepped inside. Three men were seated there. ""Sir Guy, Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings are here,"" announced Dr. Tosswill. The youngest man among them stood up excitedly and approached us, bearing a resemblance to his mother in his impulsive demeanor.",1
"A young woman named Stella and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, move into a flat at Montagu Mansions for an incredibly low rent. There are suspicions surrounding the cheap rent and the mysterious circumstances of previous occupants. Poirot and Hastings take up residence in the same building to investigate further. It is discovered that the previous occupants were involved in a theft of important naval plans, leading to a series of unexpected events.",1
"""He confessed to getting involved with a dangerous crowd, mentioning the elusive 'Colonel' for the first time. Carton insisted that he had never been part of any criminal activity before, a claim I was tentatively accepting. However, there was a lingering suspicion that he was withholding information. To provoke a reaction, I threatened him with a gun, claiming I no longer cared about the consequences. In a panic, he revealed more unsettling details.""",1
"""I was in the neighborhood, yes. Sir Eustace has not already told you? I hoped he had not recognized me, but from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is only too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, with an abnormal sense of humor. It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts.""",1
"""It's quite the revelation, isn't it, his intention to step down? To step down! Just like a surgeon, or a tailor, or a mechanic,"" Nadina remarked. ""It's to be expected. The 'Colonel' has long been a skilled businessman. He's structured crime much like one would structure a textile mill. Without getting his hands dirty, he has orchestrated and overseen a string of remarkable achievements, covering all aspects of what one might refer to as his 'trade.'""",1
"I noticed that the cupboard appeared empty at first, but my persistence paid off when I discovered a hard paper cylinder hidden in a trough in the corner. Upon grabbing it, I immediately recognized it as a roll of Kodak films. This was a valuable discovery! While I considered the possibility that the films belonged to Sir Eustace Pedler and had been overlooked during the cupboard's previous search, the red paper seemed too new for that to be the case.",1
"Meanwhile, the battle rages on."" ""I hope,"" I mused, ""that only those deserving are the ones meeting their demise. Those who truly sought conflict, not innocent residents caught in the crossfire."" He nodded in agreement. ""I understand your sentiment, Anne. The injustice of war. But I have something else to share with you."" ""What is it?"" ""I must confess my own failure. Pedler has successfully fled."" ""What?"" ""Indeed. His escape remains a mystery to all.""",1
"""Imagine, my dear friend, the actual rent for those apartments is £350. I just confirmed this with the landlord's agents. However, this specific apartment is being sublet for eighty pounds! Why is that?"" Poirot shook his head, clearly not satisfied. ""There must be some issue with it. Maybe it's haunted, like Mrs. Robinson suggested."" ""But don't you think it's possible that her friend simply went to the wrong apartment? That would explain everything.""",1
"Let's go to Marsdon Manor and investigate further,” Poirot suggested, leading the way out of the consulting room. Mrs. Maltravers, a young and beautiful widow, followed us silently. Her eyes were red from crying, but her beauty was undeniable. She explained that her husband had been out shooting rooks on the day of his death. Poirot examined the rook rifle that was left in the hall. We needed to uncover the truth behind Mr. Maltravers' sudden demise.",1
"Poirot raised an eyebrow, ""M. Stonor, how long has the English chauffeur, Masters, been with M. Renauld?"" Stonor replied confidently, ""Over a year."" Poirot continued, ""And has he ever traveled to South America?"" Stonor shook his head, ""I'm quite sure he hasn't. Before working for Mr. Renauld, he was in Gloucestershire for many years with people I know."" Poirot pressed, ""So you can vouch for him as being beyond suspicion?"" Stonor nodded, ""Absolutely.""",1
"""In those days, she did not go by the name of Madame Daubreuil,"" Poirot corrected me with a smile. ""That woman in the picture is the infamous Madame Beroldy!"" Suddenly, memories flooded back to me. The sensational Beroldy Case, a murder trial that had captured global attention. Around twenty years prior to the events of our story, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, hailing from Lyons, had made his way to Paris with his beautiful wife and their young daughter.",1
"I pondered what to do with a man of his nature. ""If it's too shameful to share with me,"" I started with malice. Finally, I hit a nerve. Pagett tensed up and turned red. ""Shameful? Ashamed? I'm lost."" ""Then explain it to me."" In just three sentences, he spilled the beans. And there it was, Pagett's hidden truth revealed! It was nothing like I had anticipated. I made my way back to the hotel in a daze. A telegram was waiting for me. I ripped it apart.",1
"Nadina, a captivating Russian performer who had captivated the audience in Paris, gracefully acknowledged the applause with a bow. Her dark eyes narrowed slightly as her crimson lips formed a subtle smile. The French spectators cheered fervently as the curtain descended, concealing the vibrant colors of the extravagant set. Dressed in flowing blue and orange fabrics, the dancer exited the stage. A man with a beard eagerly embraced her - the Manager.",1
"“When we first arrived in Merlinville, do you recall the striking girl at the gate? You mentioned a young goddess, but all I saw was a girl with troubled eyes. That’s how I’ve always seen Marthe Daubreuil. The girl with troubled eyes. Why was she so troubled? It wasn’t about Jack Renauld, as she didn’t know he had been in Merlinville the night before.” “Speaking of Jack Renauld, how is he doing?” “He’s improving. Still staying at Villa Marguerite.”",1
"I discovered a wireless message sent to Nadina from someone on the Kilmorden, either Carton or Rayburn. The message read 'Seventeen one twenty two,' which I interpreted as an appointment with Rayburn. Pretending to believe Rayburn's lies, I allowed him to board the ship in order to keep a close eye on him. However, my investigation was interrupted by Minks, who was trying to go behind my back. I quickly put a stop to that, and he fell back in line.",1
"I planned everything meticulously, sending him to Florence while informing the hotel that I was heading to Nice for a night or maybe two. When the murder was uncovered, I had already returned to Cannes, without anyone suspecting I had even left the Riviera. His demeanor remained casual and genuine, making it hard to believe he was the notorious criminal known as the ""Colonel."" As I processed everything in my head, it all started to fall into place.",1
"Jewels, cash, and bearer bonds all meticulously laid out, but for whom? Monsieur Davenheim, a man who always put himself first. It was clear - he had orchestrated it all for his own benefit. His recent obsession with buying jewelry made it all too easy. The money he had stolen was transformed into gems, likely substituted with fake copies, and stashed away under a different identity. A sizable fortune awaiting him, hidden until the coast was clear.",1
"""I'll be there in a minute, my friend. Just about done. Gotta get rid of this pesky grease spot!"" He gestured with his sponge. I smirked, lighting another cigarette. ""Watching anything interesting?"" I asked a few moments later. ""Helping a 'charlady' track down her missing husband. Tricky situation, requires finesse. I suspect he won't be too happy when we find him. Can't blame him, really. Takes a discerning man to get lost like that."" I chuckled.",1
"""Poirot wasted no time in confronting Captain Black as soon as he arrived at the inn. Without delay, he brought him up to our room, where we had been waiting. ""I have informed Captain Black of our purpose here,"" Poirot stated. ""I am eager to understand Mr. Maltravers' state of mind before his death, without causing unnecessary distress to Mrs. Maltravers. You were present just before the incident occurred, providing valuable insight that we seek.""",1
"However, the conversation shifted when the topic of jewels arose. Mrs. Blair and Miss Beddingfeld both turned to Colonel Race with excitement, exclaiming ""Diamonds!"" in unison. They bombarded Race with questions about his experiences in Kimberley, eager to learn more about the mines and the treatment of the native workers. Despite my own visit to Kimberley, I found myself unable to join in the conversation as Race expertly fielded their inquiries.",1
"Renauld’s plans to mislead the authorities were deceptively simple, a hallmark of a master criminal. Madame Renauld seemed a likely suspect, given her close relationship with the victim, but evidence pointed away from her guilt. The only other person known to be privy to Renauld’s intentions was Marthe Daubreuil, who confessed to overhearing his altercation with the vagrant. This revelation raised new questions and suspicions in the investigation.",1
"The timing of 'the Western Star' showing up on the same day caught my attention immediately. Everything seems to be going smoothly for Lord Yardly as he gets ready to retire. But then the threat of the diamond being sold emerges. The switch will eventually be uncovered. She undoubtedly sends an urgent message to Gregory Rolf, who has recently returned to England. He reassures her by guaranteeing to handle everything and plans for a two-fold theft.",1
"""I wandered aimlessly, completely unaware that I was pushing the poor girl to her breaking point. Had she succeeded in stabbing me, I would have had it coming. Her bravery in coming forward now is truly admirable. I was prepared to face the consequences, right until the very end.""

"""The inheritance was a shock to everyone. Renauld's wife inherited everything, while his son was completely left out. Many questioned the lack of trust Renauld seemed to have in his own son, despite his mother's love for him.

The investigation continues, with hopes of uncovering more answers from Santiago.""",1
"""There are just half a dozen English and American women in total, and they are all significantly senior to the woman you seek. You will not locate her here, sir."" His certainty made me question myself. ""Yet the woman informed me she was residing here."" ""Sir, you must be mistaken or perhaps the woman is, as another man came by earlier asking for her."" ""Excuse me?"" I exclaimed, taken aback. ""Indeed, sir. A man who depicted her exactly as you have.""",1
"The accused's relations were purely platonic, which only fueled suspicions against her. Unable to become his mistress due to the man's upstanding character, Jeanne Beroldy plotted to rid herself of her husband and marry the wealthy American. Madame Beroldy remained composed and confident in the face of her interrogators. She maintained her story, insisting she was of noble lineage and a victim of a childhood switch with a fruit seller's daughter.",1
"’Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We readily agreed to this suggestion and arrived in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was already present, looking surprised to see his fiancée with two unfamiliar faces. He was a handsome young man, tall and neatly dressed, with a hint of grey at his temples, despite his young age. Miss Farquhar approached him and placed her hand on his arm.",1
"""To see those two brought to justice, that is a different story. Japp will do his best, but I fear we may have to leave it to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer."" ""The wicked may prosper for a time,"" I replied. ""But there is always a cost, mon ami."" Poirot's fears were realized. Despite Japp's confidence in his theory, he couldn't gather enough evidence for a conviction. Mr. Pace's substantial fortune fell into the hands of his killers.""",1
"He was a young man with a determined look in his eyes. We locked gazes, and he didn't back down. ""Okay,"" I muttered weakly. ""Just keep quiet about me coming along."" I hesitated, feeling a sense of foreboding about the situation. It seemed like a good idea to have him by my side, but I couldn't shake the feeling that trouble was on the horizon. Just when I thought things were finally settling down! As he turned to leave, I called out to stop him.",1
"Poirot scanned the room, taking note of the key details that I had outlined in a diagram. ""Where does that door lead?"" he asked, gesturing towards the one beside the window. ""Into the next room, I think,"" replied the inspector. ""It's locked from this side."" Poirot approached the door, tested it, then unlocked and retested it. ""And locked on the other side too,"" he observed. ""That avenue is closed."" Moving on, he inspected the windows one by one.",1
"""But the man posing as the Prime Minister was observed by all!""""He was not spotted by those who were close to him. Daniels made sure to keep him isolated. Additionally, his face was covered with bandages, and any strange behavior could easily be attributed to the shock from the assassination attempt. Mr. MacAdam has a delicate throat and conserves his voice before important speeches. The ruse was upheld without difficulty until reaching France.",1
"""I suspected someone was approaching from behind, but I couldn't confirm it. They wouldn't have been as close as I was,"" I told the investigator. Mr. Flemming, who accompanied me to the inquest, seemed anxious about my well-being, unaware of my composed facade. The victim, identified as L. B.

"""Is this for my father?"" He asked, his voice filled with emotion and indignation. ""Yes, we discovered it in his coat pocket."" ""Do you know who sent it?"" He paused, glancing briefly at his mother. The magistrate caught on. ""Not yet. Any thoughts on the sender?"" ""I'm clueless,"" M. Hautet admitted. ""A truly baffling case. Well, I guess we can eliminate the letter as a lead now. Your thoughts, M. Giraud?"" ""It's a dead end,"" the detective confirmed.",1
"I believe the threat is close at hand, so I urge you to swiftly travel to France. Notify me of your arrival time and I will arrange for a car to pick you up in Calais. Please set aside your current cases and focus solely on my affairs. I am willing to cover any expenses required. Your assistance will likely be needed for an extended duration, including a potential trip to Santiago, where I resided for many years. Your fee is entirely up to you.",1
"I couldn't help but notice that you were three minutes late, despite saying it would only be two. Your scientific background must be to blame for that, as women are usually quite punctual. Despite finding Lord Nasby tiresome, I left feeling triumphant. My plan had worked better than expected - Lord Nasby was surprisingly friendly. Now, all that was left was to prove myself. Once alone in my room, I carefully examined my valuable piece of paper.",1
"With a quick gesture, the woman grabbed a large black velvet cat that was hiding the telephone. ""The documents are hidden in the lining of this,"" she revealed. ""Impressive,"" Poirot whispered admiringly as he stepped away from the door. ""Good evening, madame. I will keep your New York friend occupied while you escape."" ""Idiot!"" shouted the Italian man, raising his gun and firing at the woman as she fled, prompting me to tackle him to the ground.",1
"""In that instant of frigid rationality, I berated myself for being overly theatrical, longing for the quiet monotony of Smallington. These thoughts raced through my mind in a mere moment. Instinctively, I inched backwards, searching for the door handle. The man holding me captive smirked. ""You're here now, and here you will remain,"" he said jokingly. Trying to appear brave, I stated, ""I was brought here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.""",1
"Deep down, he's all about business, that man! He seduced Lady Yardly, then he extorted money from her. I confronted her about it last night, and she confessed. She claimed it was just a mistake, and I trust her. But, Rolf definitely had some of her letters that could be misconstrued. Fearing a divorce and losing her kids, she caved to his demands. With no savings of her own, she had no choice but to let him swap the genuine gem for a fake one.",1
"Despite the recent betrayal, I knew the importance of monitoring his every move to protect Bella. Giraud and the French authorities showed no concern for her safety. It was crucial for me to stick close to Poirot at all times. His keen eyes caught my contemplative gaze, and he nodded in approval. ""You see the wisdom in my plan, don't you? Rather than risk you clumsily tailing me in a laughable disguise, let us journey together,"" he suggested.",1
"I never knew what bêche-de-mer was, and I probably never will. I've made guesses before and they've always been wrong. In South Africa, they talk about a stoep, which I now know is the same as a veranda or a piazza. Pawpaws were another mystery to me until I had one for breakfast. I mistook it for a bad melon at first, but a Dutch waitress set me straight. Lemon juice and sugar made it much more palatable. I was glad to finally meet a pawpaw.",1
"I was surprised to find that she really was fond of me. I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. After recovering from our emotions, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you.""",1
"Poirot quickly noticed the missing stick, but chose not to mention it. Instead, we headed back to the village with haste, settling in at the Anchor Inn. Poirot pointed out the significance of returning to London on the first train, hinting at Mrs. Maltravers' reaction to seeing the young Black. It was clear she was surprised, while he appeared quite devoted. And interestingly enough, he had been present the night before Mr. Maltravers' death.",1
"""Did he have any issues at home? Was the husband and wife getting along?” “His family life seemed peaceful and routine. Mrs. Davenheim was a nice, but not very bright woman. A bit of a nobody, really.” “So, we can rule out any problems there. What about enemies?” “He had a lot of business competitors, and probably some people he outsmarted who didn't like him. But no one with a motive to harm him, and if they did, where's the body?” “Right.""",1
"""Friday, we're headed to Yardly Chase to visit Lord and Lady Yardly,"" she said, stirring a faint memory in my mind. There was a scandal a few years back involving their trip to the States. Lord Yardly was rumored to have indulged in wild escapades with some ladies, but there was more to it. Whispers connected Lady Yardly to a Hollywood star - Gregory B. Rolf. Miss Marvell leaned in, ""I have a secret to share, Monsieur Poirot,"" she whispered.",1
"""He was unfamiliar with Hercule Poirot's techniques. Unlike Poirot, he preferred to work internally, relying on his intuition and intellect rather than frantic legwork. This approach, he believed, was more effective. Poirot's dismissive attitude towards certain investigative methods sparked a debate. While fingerprints had indeed solved cases, Poirot pointed out the potential for wrongful convictions. His skepticism was met with resistance.""",1
"As the time approached for my departure, a sense of melancholy overcame me. Would he release me without a word or gesture? His brooding silences and sudden outbursts of restlessness kept me on edge. The breaking point arrived one evening as we sat outside the hut, the setting sun casting long shadows. My hair, lacking the confinement of hairpins, cascaded down my back in a dark, straight curtain. Lost in my thoughts, I pondered my next move.",1
"I couldn't stand not knowing the woman's name, so I decided to take a casual walk inside to search. Perhaps she was in the lounge. Merlinville was a small town with the beach as the main attraction. A casino was under construction, but not open yet. After scanning the beach with no luck, I concluded she must be in the hotel. Upon entering, I scanned the small lounge but didn't spot her. I checked other rooms, but she was nowhere to be found.",1
"""As an afterthought,"" Poirot inquired, ""has M. Stonor visited Merlinville today?"" Madame Daubreuil calmly responded, ""Not to my knowledge."" Poirot continued, ""Has he met with Mrs. Renauld?"" ""I cannot say, monsieur,"" she replied. With a nod, Poirot concluded, ""I was simply curious if you had seen him around. Good night, madame."" I started to ask, ""Why?"" Poirot interrupted, ""No questions for now, Hastings. There will be opportunity later on.""",1
"""Excellent. Give it some time."" An hour passed before a brightly dressed young woman made her way out. Poirot quietly returned to the apartment, satisfied. ""That's it. First the owners, then the maid. The place should be clear now."" ""What's the plan?"" I inquired nervously. Poirot swiftly headed to the scullery, pulling on the coal-lift rope. ""We're going down incognito, like the dustbins,"" he said with a grin. ""No one will suspect a thing.""",1
"""His memory was blank, only recalling a sudden pressure on his face and a desperate fight for freedom. Law enforcement deemed his account credible."" ""Have they uncovered anything else?"" ""Negative."" ""No sign of the PM's corpse? There might be a chance. Yet, it's odd. After the assassination attempt earlier, why the effort to preserve his life now?"" Dodge shrugged. ""It’s clear they'll stop at nothing to stop him from reaching the Conference.""",1
"""Monsieur le juge, he died of an epileptic fit, if I am not mistaken,"" declared Poirot, causing a stir. Dr. Durand conducted a thorough examination and then stood up. ""So, Doctor?"" inquired Poirot. ""I must agree with you, Monsieur Poirot. I was initially misled by the stabbing, but now I see the truth,"" admitted Dr. Durand. Poirot basked in the praise, becoming the center of attention. The examining magistrate showered him with compliments.",1
"""What is that?” “Jack Renauld was likely familiar with the layout of the golf course. He anticipated the body being found quickly once they began to dig the bunker.” Giraud burst into laughter. “But that's absurd! He wanted the body to be discovered! Until then, death couldn't be assumed, preventing him from inheriting.” A flash of green appeared in Poirot's eyes as he stood up. “So why bury it?” he inquired softly. “Think about it, Giraud.",1
"The purser conveyed his apologies for her absence in a sincerely manner as he assigned me her room, and afterwards Colonel Race shared some intriguing insights about her. Rumors of her involvement in espionage circulated in Paris, though no evidence was ever found. It appeared that Colonel Race had been deployed to investigate this matter. He disclosed details about a sophisticated criminal network, revealing it to be non-German in nature.",1
