"“And, indeed, he may be against him, for all we know. To continue my surmises, Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He read the paper he dropped. Misled by the dot as you were, he tries to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, after trying to acquire the cabin through Pagett. On the way, somebody stabs him.” “Who?” I asked. “Chichester. It all fits. Cable Lord Nasby that you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “You’ve overlooked several things.” “Such as?” “Rayburn has a scar, but it can be easily faked. He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head you pulverized them with at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was well-educated, but I hoped she didn’t know anthropology terms. “Dolichocephalic,” I said. Suzanne looked unsure. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed. A head whose width is less than 75% of its length,” I explained. A pause followed. Just as I began to relax, Suzanne asked, “What’s the opposite?” “The opposite?” “There must be one. What do you call heads with breadth more than 75% of their length?” “Brachycephalic,” I reluctantly admitted. “I thought so.” “Did I? It was a mistake. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said confidently. Suzanne looked at me intently. “You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But tell me everything now.” “There’s nothing to tell,” I said. “Isn’t there?” Suzanne questioned gently. “I suppose I’ll have to tell you,” I said slowly. “I’m not ashamed. That’s what he did. He was rude and ungrateful, but I understand. I care horribly. Just seeing him has turned my life upside-down. I love him. I want him. I’ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I find him!” Suzanne studied me. “You’re very un-English, Gipsy girl. It’s something to care. But what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn’t marry him.” “So no cabling to Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “Yet you believe him innocent?” “I also believe innocent people can be hanged.” “He may have murdered her.” “No,” I said. “He didn’t.” “Sentiment.” “He wouldn’t strangle her with a bit of black cord. If he did it, he’d use his bare hands.” Suzanne shivered. “Beginning to see why you find him attractive!” I spoke to Colonel Race the next morning. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land?” I shook my head. “I’d like to stay on the sea forever.” We leaned over the rail. The sea was calm, with patches of color. “Interesting story last night,” I said. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “Of course women are interested in diamonds.” “What happened to the other young man?” “Young Lucas? He went to War and was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed.” That was all I needed to know. I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. I interviewed the night steward and got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? A harmless joke, a bet.” I got the story out of him.",1
"""The concept of suicide is out of the question now. However, if she manages to quiet Madame Renauld by force, escape using her silk ladder while we're distracted at the other door, and return to the Villa Marguerite before we do, it will be difficult to incriminate her. Marthe Daubreuil was outsmarted not by Hercule Poirot, but by the petite acrobat with wrists of steel,"" I contemplated as I reviewed the situation with Poirot. ""When exactly did you start suspecting Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? Was it when she claimed to have overheard the argument in the garden?"" Poirot responded with a smile.",1
"He managed to get the case dismissed, but it resulted in two young men being ruined and disgraced. The old man's heart was shattered, and he disowned his son. The son, however, remained silent and indifferent to his father's accusations. A week later, war broke out and the two friends enlisted together, leading to a tragic end. The man revealed to Anne that his bitterness towards a woman was due to his friend's deep love for her, which ended in betrayal. After being reported dead in the war, he assumed a new identity and lived a numb existence until a chance encounter with a man from his past sparked his desire for justice. This man, Carton, confessed to his involvement in a robbery and revealed crucial information about the woman, Anita Grünberg. In order to clear his name, the man decided to confront Anita and make a deal with her, despite his lingering suspicions about Carton's honesty. Eventually, he uncovered Carton's deceit and embarked on a journey to England to seek the truth.",1
"Poirot leaned back in his chair, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest. ""The case did not sit right with me,"" he remarked thoughtfully. ""I was convinced from the start that we were up against a calculated, premeditated crime, carefully orchestrated by someone skilled in deception.""",1
"He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.” “You don’t think ” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too horrible!” Poirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants there was, with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one man Jack Renauld. And a man must have dug a grave.… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad. “That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot. “There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you not to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an inkling of your errand.” “Very well, I will go straight to the station.” He rose to his feet. Poirot’s voice stopped him. “One moment, M. Renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me. Why did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack Renauld’s face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself. “You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining magistrate this morning.” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my unchanging devotion.” “And you did see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face. There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, mon ami, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go up to the Villa Geneviève.” “By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road, “I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.” Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me. “And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired. Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.” “Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s only that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself all right.” Poirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked himself. Arrived at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered. He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! Un moment, s’il vous plaît.” I joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly startled, came running up to the hedge at his call. “A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?” “Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.” Despite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid. “Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast. “Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M. Jack Renauld.” “What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?” “Giraud.” “Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will he will ” She broke off. There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently. “You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment maman called me from the house, and I had to go. That is all, only I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.’ Now, Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not see Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?” “Surely, Poirot,” I cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like that would murder his own father.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe anything.” “And the motive?” “Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come in to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.” “But the tramp. Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.” “And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.” “Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack. “He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, jeune homme?” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said. I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud.",1
"Life was tough, full of challenges, but it was a rewarding experience living hand-to-mouth, far from civilization. The bond between us, forged in the wilderness, was unbreakable. With Colonel Race's guidance, we discovered a hidden gem in the depths of the British Guiana jungles. The feeling of triumph was indescribable.",1
"""You must allow me to maintain my little secret. Please, convey my deepest respects to Lady Yardly, and inform her of my delight in returning her jewel. Lovely weather, isn't it? Farewell, my lord."" And with a smile and polite conversation, the peculiar man escorted the confused nobleman to the exit. Upon his return, he rubbed his hands gently. ""Poirot,"" I inquired. ""Have I lost my mind?"" ""No, my friend, but you are, as usual, lost in a mental haze."" ""How did you retrieve the diamond?"" ""From Mr. Rolf."" ""Rolf?"" ""Of course! The threatening letters, the Chinaman, the Society Gossip article, all were the creation of Mr. Rolf's cunning mind! The two identical diamonds, believed to be so rare, well! they were never real.""",1
"Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be in desperate need of money. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to have questionable morals. Point No. 3.” “However, Roger Havering has evidence of being in London during the time of the crime.” “Indeed, Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since the victim was killed after he left, we can deduce that Mr. Havering is not the shooter. But there is also a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.""",1
"""Isn't it incredible that he's planning to step down? Just like a doctor, a butcher, or a plumber,"" Nadina remarked. ""It's not unexpected. The 'Colonel' has always been a savvy businessman. He's managed crime like someone would manage a shoe factory. Without getting his hands dirty, he has orchestrated a series of impressive operations across all aspects of his 'work.'""",1
"There was a sudden commotion as Harry Rayburn was forcefully brought into the room by two men, while Sir Eustace watched with a triumphant expression. ""You amateurs are no match for professionals,"" he sneered. Harry demanded an explanation, to which Sir Eustace replied smugly, ""You've walked right into my trap, just like the fly to the spider."" Despite Harry's plea to Anne for safety, it was clear that they were all in grave danger.",1
"""Maybe my husband went out for a stroll and forgot to latch the door when he came back,"" she suggested. ""He was quite absent-minded.""  The magistrate interjected, ""It seems that the men taking M. Renauld had a location in mind, one that was not too far away since he mentioned being back by morning.""  Poirot inquired about the last train from Merlinville station, to which the response was that it was late, suggesting that a motor was likely used instead.  The magistrate then asked Mrs. Renauld about a certain 'Duveen,' but she was unfamiliar with the name. Similarly, she did not know anyone named 'Bella.'   There was mention of Mrs. Renauld's son, who was on his way to Buenos Ayres, and the purpose of his trip was unknown to her.  Following a fainting spell from Mrs. Renauld upon seeing her husband's body, Poirot suggested examining footprints near the crime scene, which he believed to be crucial evidence. Giraud, a detective, arrived at the scene and expressed his determination to uncover clues.",1
"Poirot carefully examined the man's appearance, noting his long wavy hair, full moustache, pointed beard, and bushy eyebrows. Confirming the dark eyes and grey hair, he pondered the mystery before him. The detective from Scotland Yard seemed optimistic about solving the case, but Poirot believed that obscurity was a positive sign. Japp, on the other hand, thought clarity was key. The two men were at odds in their approach to the investigation.",1
"""You will have a Military officer and a C.I.D. man at your disposal throughout this investigation. Does that meet your approval?"" ""Certainly. Before you go, gentlemen, may I ask why you chose to seek me out? I am but a stranger in this vast city of London."" ""We were directed to you by a highly respected individual from your homeland."" ""Ah, my dear Préfet?"" Lord Estair shook his head. ""Someone even more esteemed than the Préfet. A figure of great authority in Belgium, whose influence will once again reign supreme! An oath that England has sworn!"" Poirot's hand snapped up in a sharp salute.",1
"""We were quickly escorted out. 'I am let down,' remarked Poirot, stepping onto the sidewalk. 'You were hoping for more? Those old men are so dull.' 'It's not their dullness that bothers me, my friend. I don't anticipate a Bank manager to be a 'sharp financial expert with a piercing stare' as your beloved novels describe. No, I am let down because the case is too simple!' 'Simple?' 'Indeed, don't you think it's almost laughably easy?' 'You know who took the bonds?' 'I do.' 'Then we must find out why.' 'Don't worry, Hastings. We won't take any action for now.""",1
"Poirot,” I said, shaking his hand. “You are truly a magician!”",1
"The accused was in a platonic relationship with Jeanne Beroldy, who conspired to kill her husband and marry a rich American. Madame Beroldy maintained her innocence with calm confidence, insisting she was of royal birth and had been switched at a young age with a fruit seller's daughter.",1
"Poirot interrupted: “You are mistaken. There is another individual who could have taken the dagger.” “You mean M. Stonor? He came to the front entrance, in a car that had transported him directly from Calais. Now, let's talk about the means. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that evening. He hid this detail, which shifted suspicion to certainty. Later, we discovered a second victim stabbed with the same weapon. We are aware of when the dagger went missing. Captain Hastings can determine the exact time. Jack Renauld, coming from Cherbourg, was the sole individual with the opportunity to take it. I have eliminated all other residents of the household.”",1
"Major Norman gestured towards a military car waiting for Poirot. Despite the offer, Poirot decided to stay in Boulogne. He led the group to a nearby hotel and requested a private room. Confused by his actions, the group followed him as he explained, ""A good detective must be full of energy, rushing to and fro, seeking clues on the dusty road.""",1
"I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained. I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett was too tempting to be forborne. ""What do you mean?"" I said. ""Of course I shall wear fancy dress. So will you."" Pagett shuddered. ""So go down to the barber's and see about it,"" I finished. ""I don't think he'll have any out sizes,"" murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye. Without meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive. ""And order a table for six in the saloon,"" I said. ""We'll have the Captain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair""   ""You won't get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,"" Pagett interposed. ""He's asked her to dine with him, I know."" Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. ""Who is Race?"" I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. ""They say he's a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don't know for certain."" ""Isn't that like the Government?"" I exclaimed. ""Here's a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone."" Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice. ""If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started""   ""My dear fellow,"" I interrupted brutally, ""that was a bilious attack. You're always having bilious attacks."" Pagett winced slightly. ""It wasn't the usual sort of bilious attack. This time ""For God's sake, don't go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don't want to hear them."" ""Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!"" ""Ah!"" I said. ""You've been talking to Rayburn."" He did not deny it. ""At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know."" ""By the way, where is the chap?"" I asked. ""I've not set eyes on him since we came on board."" ""He gives out that he's ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace."" Pagett's voice dropped again. ""But that's camouflage, I'm sure. So that he can watch better."" ""Watch?""   ""Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you."" ""You're such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,"" I said. ""I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death's head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty."" That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson's feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn't help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: ""Don't try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.",1
"The contents of her black silk purse included a bulging wallet, a few coins, a delicate lace handkerchief, and half of a first-class ticket to London. Not much to work with. These were the details plastered all over the Daily Budget, urging readers to ""Find the Man in the Brown Suit."" Each day, around five hundred individuals claimed to have cracked the case, while sun-kissed men regretted ever donning brown suits.",1
"""No, the paper wasn't the issue. Do you happen to have it on you? I would like to take a look at it."" I had Exhibit A in my possession and handed it to her. Upon inspecting it, she furrowed her brow. ""There's a period after the 17. Why isn't there one after the 1 as well?"" ""There is a gap,"" I observed. ""Yes, there is a gap, but..."" Suddenly, she stood up and examined the paper closely under the light. There was a suppressed eagerness in her demeanor. ""Anne, that isn't a period! It's a defect in the paper! A defect in the paper, do you understand? So you must disregard it, and focus only on the spaces, the spaces!"" I stood up and positioned myself beside her.",1
"“Quite intriguing,” remarked Poirot, his gaze now glinting with recognition. “They spent considerable time attempting to force it open, only to realize they held the key all along, as each of Hubbs’s locks is distinct.” “That’s precisely why they couldn’t have had the key. It was always in my possession, without fail.”",1
"""The case was kept under wraps to the best of their ability, and even today, people still speak of the strange series of deaths linked to the Tomb of Men-her-Ra as a sign of a long-gone king's revenge on those who violated his tomb a belief that, as Poirot mentioned to me, goes against all Egyptian beliefs and customs. “Poirot,” I suggested, “perhaps a change of scenery would do you good.” “You think so, my friend?” “I'm certain of it.” “Eh eh?” chuckled Poirot. “So it's settled, then?” “You'll come?” “And where might you be taking me?” “Brighton. A friend of mine in the City tipped me off to a great opportunity, and well, I have money to spare, as they say. I believe a weekend at the Grand Metropolitan would be just what the doctor ordered.” “Thank you, I graciously accept. You have a kind heart to think of an old man. And kindness, in the end, is more valuable than all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I, who am speaking to you, am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.” I wasn't quite pleased with the implication. I have a feeling that Poirot occasionally underestimates my intelligence. But his joy was so evident that I pushed my slight irritation aside. “Well then, it's settled,” I quickly added. Saturday evening found us dining at the Grand Metropolitan amongst a lively crowd. It seemed as though everyone and their spouse had flocked to Brighton. The attire was astonishing, and the jewelry, at times worn more for show than taste, was truly magnificent. “Ah, what a spectacle!” murmured Poirot. “This is the land of the Profiteer, isn't it, Hastings?” “That's the rumor,” I responded. “But let's hope they aren't all tainted with the stain of profiteering.” Poirot looked around contentedly. “The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned to a life of crime, rather than detection. What a splendid opportunity for a distinguished thief! Look, Hastings, at that well-built woman by the column. She is practically dripping with gems.” I followed his gaze. “Why,” I exclaimed, “it's Mrs. Opalsen.” “You know her?” “A little. Her husband is a wealthy stockbroker who struck it rich in the recent Oil boom.” After our meal, we bumped into the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a while, and ended up having coffee together. Poirot complimented some of the more expensive gems adorning the lady's chest, and she perked up immediately. “It's a passion of mine, Mr. Poirot. I adore jewelry. Ed knows my weakness, and whenever things go well, he surprises me with something new. Are you fond of precious stones?” “I've had my fair share of encounters with them over the years, madame. My line of work has brought me into contact with some of the most renowned jewels in the world.” He went on to recount, using discreet aliases, the tale of a historic royal family's jewels, and Mrs. Opalsen listened in awe. “Isn't that just like a story!” she exclaimed when he finished. “You know, I have some pearls of my own with quite a history behind them. It's said to be one of the most exquisite necklaces in the world the pearls are so perfectly matched and the color is impeccable.",1
"""An hour after the scheduled meeting time, a man with a black moustache named Lowen arrived at Mr. Davenheim's house. Despite being shown into the study, Davenheim did not return. Frustrated, Lowen rang the bell to leave, citing a need to catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim, puzzled by her husband's absence, apologized for the inconvenience.""",1
"In the past, men and women were equal in strength, like lions and tigers. Colonel Race jokingly mentioned giraffes, to which the narrator laughed. The narrator explained that women only became weak when they settled down in communities and took on different roles than men. Despite these changes, deep down, men and women are still the same, feeling the same way. Women now admire physical strength in men because it's something they once possessed but have since lost.",1
"""I don't have any cash on hand."" Papa seemed completely frustrated. ""My dear, I simply don't have time for these crude financial matters. The bank sent me a letter yesterday, mentioning that I owed twenty-seven pounds."" ""That must be your overdraft,"" I suggested. ""Oh, I remember now! Contact my publishers."" Reluctantly, I agreed, knowing that Papa's books brought him more prestige than money. The thought of traveling to Rhodesia thrilled me. ""Stern, quiet men,"" I whispered to myself in excitement. But then something about my father's appearance seemed out of the ordinary. ""You're wearing mismatched boots, papa,"" I pointed out.",1
"Masters's clothes,” he explained, “and placed it beside the open window. They also left a razor on the dressing-table. The door they locked on the inside, and took away the key.” I examined the room carefully, looking for any clues that might lead me to the truth.",1
"He walked wearily down the path towards Chingside, deciding to take a break by the side of the road just outside the village. Suddenly, he spotted a figure approaching in the distance, a man with a dark complexion and a large moustache, giving off an air of sophistication. As the man drew closer, he glanced around cautiously before discreetly tossing something over the nearby hedge, unaware that Kellett was hidden from view by a pile of rocks.",1
"""Maltravers’ state of mind right before his death was unclear, making it difficult to question Mrs. Maltravers without causing distress. You were present before the incident and may have valuable information.” “I’m willing to help in any way I can,” replied the soldier. “Although Maltravers was a friend of my family, I didn’t know him well.” “When did you arrive?” “Tuesday afternoon. I left for town early Wednesday as my boat departed from Tilbury at noon. But I changed my plans due to some news, as I explained to Mrs. Maltravers.” “Were you heading back to East Africa?” “Yes, I’ve been there since the War, a remarkable country.” “Indeed. What was discussed at dinner on Tuesday?” “Just general topics. Maltravers asked about my family, we talked about German reparations, and Mrs. Maltravers inquired about East Africa. I shared a few stories, that’s all.” “Thank you.” Poirot paused, then said gently: “May I conduct a little experiment? I want to question your subconscious self.” “Psychoanalysis?” Black asked nervously. “No, it’s simpler. I’ll say a word, you reply with another. Any word that comes to mind. Shall we start?” “Sure,” Black agreed slowly. Poirot signaled for Hastings to note down the words, then began. “Day.” “Night.” The answers came quickly as Poirot continued. “Name.” “Place.” “Bernard.” “Shaw.” “Tuesday.” “Dinner.” “Journey.” “Ship.” “Country.” “Uganda.” “Story.” “Lions.” “Rook Rifle.” “Farm.” “Shot.” “Suicide.” “Elephant.” “Tusks.” “Money.” “Lawyers.” “Thank you, Captain Black. Can you spare a few minutes in half an hour?” “Of course.” As the soldier left, Poirot smiled at Hastings. “Do you see it now?” “I’m not sure what you mean.” “Does that list of words reveal anything to you?” I examined it, but couldn’t see the connection. ""Let me explain.""",1
"“Sir Eustace Pedler’s place, The Mill House,” the man mentioned hesitantly. “That’s where the murder occurred.” I hesitated. (Seems like I'm always hesitating these days.) “Maybe you wouldn’t want to go there.” “I wouldn’t mind,” I replied, trying to sound confident. I believed I had proven my credibility. “And I might even get a good deal given the circumstances.” A clever move on my part, I thought. “It’s a possibility. Renting it out won’t be easy without staff, you know.”",1
"""I hoped the same could be said about the second try."" ""So, there was a second attempt?"" ""Indeed, but it was different. Mr. Poirot, the Prime Minister has vanished."" ""What?"" ""He's been abducted!"" ""No way!"" I exclaimed, shocked. Poirot shot me a look, silently telling me to stay quiet. ""Sadly, as unbelievable as it sounds, it's the harsh reality,"" Lordship explained. Poirot turned to Mr. Dodge. ""You mentioned earlier, sir, that timing is crucial.""",1
"I mentioned the possibility of them leaving on the midnight train, but he quickly dismissed the idea. He was certain he would have noticed two foreigners among the twenty people who left on the train. Suddenly, I asked about young M. Renauld's whereabouts that night. The man confirmed that Jack Renauld had arrived in Merlinville on the 11:40 train. My mind raced as I realized the implications of this revelation. Despite Jack's innocent appearance, his silence about being in town on the night of the crime raised suspicions. Marthe had known all along, explaining her anxious behavior. As we headed to the Villa, I informed Poirot of another murder. His shock was evident, and he quickly deduced key details about the victim. Poirot's little grey cells had already worked out the puzzle, leaving me in awe of his deductive abilities.",1
"Colonel Race gestured with his hand and Arthur Minks, also known as the Rev. Edward Chichester and Miss Pettigrew, stepped forward. Looking pale and nervous, he recounted, ""I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she left for England. Pretending to be a Russian Count, she confided in me about her plans. Despite my warning about the man she was dealing with, she did not heed my advice. I noticed a wireless message on the table, which I read. Later, I decided to make a play for the diamonds myself. However, in Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn approached me.""",1
"Sir Eustace leaned back in his chair, an air of mystery surrounding him. ""It's a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn't appeal to you,"" he mused. ""The other options are rather crude."" My spine tingled with unease - I knew the risks I was taking, but the reward had seemed worth it. Would my calculations pay off, or would they lead to my downfall? ""I have a weakness for you,"" Sir Eustace confessed. ""Tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let's see where we can go from there. But remember, I want the truth."" His shrewdness demanded respect, and I knew I had to be honest. I recounted everything, leaving no detail out. Sir Eustace nodded in approval. ""You've been wise, my dear. Many wouldn't believe your tale, but I do. You've had luck on your side, but amateurs always meet their match in the end. I am the professional."" His confession sent a chill down my spine. Sir Eustace had a long history in the business, always relying on experts to carry out his schemes. But Nadina, she was different. Her knowledge posed a threat that had to be dealt with. As we discussed the past, Sir Eustace revealed his regrets and mistakes. The bungled job, the misplaced trust in Pagett - it all came back to haunt him. ""Don't let your sense of humor cloud your judgement,"" he warned. It was clear that decisions had to be made. But what would become of me?",1
"His entire demeanor transformed when he let out a chuckle. Suddenly, he appeared youthful, carefree, a whole new persona. I savored my soup, savoring every spoonful. In between bites, I gently prodded him about the advice he had yet to give. ""Oh, right, what I meant to tell you was this. If I were in your shoes, I'd lay low here until you've fully recovered. Your foes will presume you perished. They won't be surprised by the absence of a body. It would have been shattered against the cliffs and swept away by the current."" A chill ran down my spine. ""Once you're back to your former self, you can quietly journey to Beira and find passage on a ship bound for England."" ""How dull that sounds,"" I scoffed. ""Only a naive schoolgirl would say that.""",1
"As they walked, a woman approached with an astonishing amount of items precariously balanced on her head, including a frying pan. Suzanne lamented not having her camera handy, but Colonel Race assured her that opportunities would arise. Returning to the bridge, he suggested venturing into the rainbow forest, questioning whether they were afraid of getting wet. Suzanne and I followed, while Sir Eustace headed back to the hotel. The rainbow forest turned out to be rather underwhelming.",1
"""Imagine this scenario: he awakens to catch a glimpse of me vanishing into the distance. Wouldn't he automatically assume that I was the one who attacked him? Especially considering he already suspected me of tailing him?"" ""It's a possibility,"" I responded thoughtfully. ""But it changes our entire perspective. And there are other factors to consider."" ""Most of them can be rationalized. The individual who shadowed you in Cape Town conversed with Pagett, who then checked his watch. Perhaps the man simply inquired about the time."" ""So, it was merely a coincidence?"" ""Not quite. There is a deliberate pattern at play here, linking Pagett to the incident.""",1
"""Finally, the moment I had been waiting for arrived. I resisted the urge to act impulsively. Slowly, I succumbed to the pressure and manipulation. Under Sir Eustace's guidance, I penned a letter: Dearest Harry, I have identified a promising opportunity to prove your innocence unequivocally. Pay close attention to my directives. Visit Agrasato's antique store. Request to view an item ""out of the ordinary,"" ""suitable for a special event."" Subsequently, you will be invited to ""enter the rear chamber."" Accompany the individual. There, you will encounter a courier who will escort you to me. Adhere strictly to his commands. Remember to bring the diamonds along.""",1
"""Maybe there's something hidden beneath that Françoise missed."" ""Françoise?"" ""Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever cleaned this room. Since there's no dust, it must have been cleaned this morning. Here's how I see it. Yesterday, or maybe last night, M. Renauld wrote a check to someone named Duveen. Then it was ripped up and scattered on the floor. This morning"" But M. Bex was already impatiently ringing the bell. Françoise answered. Yes, there were many paper pieces on the floor. What did she do with them? Burned them in the kitchen stove, obviously! With a hopeless gesture, Bex sent her away.",1
"Poirot calmly explained the intricate plan to me. ""M. Renauld planned his own death, but he did not intend to die,"" he said. The truth was stranger than fiction. Georges Conneau, now a wealthy man, returned to France under an assumed name after years of exile. His plan to fake his death involved a body, not a murderer. Madame Daubreuil's blackmail forced his hand. With his son Jack in love with the wrong woman, Renauld and his wife devised an elaborate scheme to escape. The unexpected death of a tramp provided the perfect opportunity. Together, they orchestrated a plan that would fool everyone. The body, dressed in Renauld's clothes, was left in a grave while Renauld disappeared. It was a plan so audacious, so carefully constructed, that it just might work.",1
"""His partners might have silenced and drugged him, but the purpose eludes me. He's useless to them now, given the scrutiny due to the Prime Minister's situation."" ""Maybe they wanted to mislead the police?"" ""But why not follow through? He claims something covered his nose and mouth, leaving him with no memory. No deception there. Sounds like the truth."" ""Alright,"" I remarked, checking the time, ""Time to head to the station.""",1
"I knew I'd be intercepted before reaching my destination. Glancing at the clock, it was almost eleven. If my plan worked, I might make it. Entering the station through Adderly Street, I quickly exited through the side. Across from me was the post office side entrance. Predictably, my pursuer ran to intercept me at the main entrance. But I slipped back into the station, running frantically. The train was leaving as I reached the platform. Evading a porter, I boarded the train and made my escape. Passing a man on the platform, I bid him farewell. The conductor questioned me, but I asserted my identity as Sir Eustace Pedler's secretary. Joining Suzanne and Colonel Race on the observation platform, they were surprised to see me. After a brief exchange, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was engrossed in dictating to his secretary, Miss Pettigrew. I interrupted their conversation, catching Sir Eustace off guard. Miss Pettigrew seemed startled by my appearance. ""I choose you,"" I whispered softly.",1
"Suzanne carefully hollowed out the object, concealing the diamonds with cotton wool to silence any potential noise, before sealing it back up again."" Sir Eustace stared at me intently before speaking, ""I always despised that wretched giraffe,"" he muttered. ""It was a gut feeling."" Returning to Johannesburg was out of the question that evening due to the increasing shellfire, leaving us stranded as the rebels advanced further into the suburbs. Our sanctuary was a remote farm located approximately twenty miles away from the city, surrounded by vast open plains. Exhaustion weighed heavily on me.",1
"I waited a few minutes before leaving the station. As I stepped outside, I nearly bumped into a man - a rather unsavory character, his nose much too large for his face. No obstacles hindered my plans thereafter. I located a quaint hotel down a quiet alleyway, secured a room sans luggage, and peacefully retired for the night. The next day, I rose at dawn and ventured into town to acquire some basic clothing. My intention was to bide my time until the eleven o'clock train to Rhodesia departed, carrying away the majority of the crowd.",1
"“It foretells disaster.” “Rubbish. You don’t feel the same way.” “No, but I’m scared.” “Scared of what?” “I don’t know. But I have a sense of foreboding, a certain something!” His tone was so serious that I couldn't help but be affected. “I have a sense,” he said deliberately, “that this will be a significant matter, a lengthy, troublesome issue that won't be easily resolved.” I wanted to ask him more, but we were approaching the small town of Merlinville, and we slowed down to ask for directions to the Villa Geneviève. “Go straight, sir, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is located about half a mile on the other side.",1
"""I had the girl's luggage searched upon her arrival. So where did you suddenly produce it from? You didn't have it a moment ago."" ""Actually, I did,"" I responded. ""It was hidden in my stocking."" ""I really should have studied women more,"" Sir Eustace lamented. ""I wonder if Pagett would have known that?"" Harry banged his fist on the table. ""Stop playing games. If it weren't for your age, I'd throw you out the window. You scoundrel! Age or not, I..."" He took a couple of steps forward, causing Sir Eustace to quickly retreat behind the table.",1
"Poirot gently touched my arm, signaling to slip away as our services were no longer needed. Surprisingly, he expressed a desire to see the room next door. Inside, he noticed dust and a rectangular mark on a table. Poirot then speculated on the possibility of the door being bolted on both sides. As we left, he paused outside a small den, where the chambermaids and valets congregated. Poirot asked for Mr. Opalsen's room to be unlocked, showing a peculiar card to the valet. The chambermaid had never seen such a card. Poirot rang the bell for the valet, who examined the card but had no knowledge of it. Poirot revealed that the card had a surface for finger-prints and had led to the arrest of two jewel thieves. The necklace was found in the possession of the valet, solving the case.",1
"I suspect that Madame Daubreuil ventures out to search for her lover. A heated confrontation ensues between her and Conneau, leading to him dragging her into the shed where he suddenly collapses in an epileptic seizure. If Jack Renauld were to arrive at that moment, Madame Daubreuil would reveal everything to him, emphasizing the disastrous impact the resurrection of this scandal from the past would have on her daughter. With his father's killer now deceased, they agree to keep it buried. Jack Renauld then persuades his mother to see things from his perspective during their discussion at the house.",1
"""A cigarette butt and a match."" Poirot gestured broadly. ""And what is your interpretation?"" Giraud spoke with confidence. ""This match is no ordinary one, not from around here at least. It's commonly found in South America. Luckily it's not lit. Otherwise, I may not have recognized it. It appears that one of the individuals discarded his cigarette butt, and lit another, accidentally dropping a match out of the box in the process."" Poirot inquired, ""And the match that was used to light the cigarette? Have you found that as well?"" ""No,"" responded Giraud. ""Perhaps your search was not thorough enough."" Poirot raised an eyebrow. The commissary interjected, ""The cigarette butt and match could have belonged to Mr. Renauld. Remember, he only returned from South America two years ago."" Giraud dismissed the idea confidently. ""I have already checked Mr. Renauld's belongings. The cigarettes and matches he used are different."" Poirot pressed on, ""Isn't it peculiar that these strangers arrived without a weapon, gloves, or a spade, only to conveniently find these items?"" Giraud smirked. ""Undoubtedly strange. Without my theory, it would be inexplicable."" ""Ah,"" said M. Hautet. ""An accomplice. An accomplice inside the house!"" ""Or outside,"" Giraud added with a mysterious smile. ""But someone must have let them in, right? Surely they didn't just happen upon an unlocked door?"" ""Agreed, Mr. Judge. The door was opened for them, possibly by someone with a key,"" Giraud explained. ""But who had a key?"" Giraud shrugged. ""No one with a key would admit it willingly. There are several possibilities. The son, Jack Renauld, or the long-time gardener. Even a young servant with a lover could have had a key made. And then there's one person who is highly likely to possess such a key."" Poirot inquired, ""And who might that be?"" Giraud replied dryly, ""Madame Daubreuil. I believe she may hold the key."" ""Ah,"" said the magistrate, his expression shifting. ""So you know about that, do you?"" ""I know many things,"" Giraud stated calmly. ""But there is one thing I'm certain you haven't heard,"" M.",1
"""I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I announced proudly. “Kindly escort me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were on the rear observation platform, surprised to see me. “Well, well, Miss Anne,” exclaimed Colonel Race, “what brings you here? Didn’t you leave for Durban?” Suzanne remained silent, her eyes filled with curiosity. “I must inform my superior,” I stated calmly. “Where can I find him?” “He’s in the office compartment, dictating furiously to Miss Pettigrew,” replied Colonel Race. “Quite a change in his work ethic,” I remarked. “Indeed,” agreed Colonel Race.",1
"""I spoke cautiously, ""We are aware that the dagger could not have been in possession of Jack Renauld that night. Mrs. Renauld is also aware of this."" Stonor nodded in agreement. ""When she regains consciousness, she will likely reveal more. Now, I must take my leave."" Poirot intervened, ""Wait. If Madame Renauld wakes up, please inform me immediately."" Stonor assured, ""Of course. That can be arranged."" As we ascended the stairs, I pressed, ""The point about the dagger is crucial, Poirot. I couldn't elaborate in front of Stonor."" Poirot responded, ""It was wise of you. Let's keep this information between us for now.""",1
"""But alas, the cavity revealed emptiness. “Mon Dieu!” exclaimed Poirot in frustration. “Another has beaten us to it.” We scrutinized the torn paper with trepidation. It was evident that this was part of the document we were searching for. Some of Baker’s signature was still visible, yet there were no clues as to the contents of the will. Poirot leaned back, his expression almost comical if not for the gravity of the situation. “I cannot comprehend,” he muttered. “Who would do such a thing? And why?” “The Bakers, perhaps?” I ventured.",1
"""You recall the De Beer diamonds?"" ""Indeed, I do. In Kimberley, prior to the outbreak of war? I was not involved, and the specifics were never revealed to me, the case was silenced for unknown reasons, correct? A substantial haul indeed."" ""Valued at one hundred thousand pounds. Two of us executed it on the 'Colonel's' orders, naturally. That is when I seized my opportunity. The objective was to swap some of the De Beer diamonds with sample diamonds carried from South America by two inexperienced prospectors who were coincidentally in Kimberley at the time.""",1
"""I had the girl's luggage searched upon her arrival. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn't got it on you a minute ago?"" ""Yes, I had,"" I responded. ""It was in my stocking."" ""I don't know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,"" Sir Eustace said sadly. ""I wonder if Pagett would have known that?"" Harry rapped sharply on the table. ""Don't play the fool. If it weren't for your grey hairs, I'd throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I"" He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table. ""The young are always so violent,"" he said reproachfully. ""Unable to use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk sense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of affairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are hopelessly outnumbered. Your momentary ascendency has been gained by an accident."" ""Has it?"" Something in Harry's voice, a grim raillery, seemed to attract Sir Eustace's attention. He stared at him. ""Has it?"" said Harry again. ""Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say."" Still covering him with the revolver, he continued: ""The cards are against you this time. To begin with, listen to that!"" That was a dull banging at the door below. There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. ""What's that?"" ""Race and his people. You didn't know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed 'Andy,' letters were to have the word 'and' crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated."" There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. ""They're shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne."" A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him covered with the revolver. ""So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up. It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race's men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here."" Sir Eustace turned suddenly. ""Very clever. Very creditable. But I've still a word to say. If I've lost the trick, so have you.""",1
"""I will be honest with you. You appear to be quite knowledgeable.” “I have utilized my intellect well. Signor Ascanio, you were at the deceased man's place on Tuesday morning, correct?” “Yes, but I did not return there the next evening. It was unnecessary. Let me explain. This scoundrel had obtained sensitive information about a prominent figure in Italy. He requested a large sum of money for the documents. I traveled to England to handle the situation. I met with him as planned that morning. A young secretary from the Embassy accompanied me.",1
"Where had his usually keen wits gone? “They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.” “Tiens!” exclaimed Poirot, stepping back with admiration. “Your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Imagine that for a moment I hadn’t thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full moon isn’t until Friday.” I was doubtful about the full moon theory. However, I convinced Poirot to leave immediately, leaving a note for Lord Yardly. My plan to go to the Magnificent was vetoed by Poirot, who insisted morning would be soon enough. Reluctantly, I agreed. The next morning, Poirot was hesitant to go out. I suspected he regretted starting the case. He argued that since the details of Yardly Chase were in the papers, the Rolfs already knew everything. Reluctantly, I gave in. My suspicions were confirmed when the phone rang at two o’clock. Poirot answered, listened, then announced that Miss Marvell’s diamond had been stolen. I jumped up, questioning the ‘full of the moon’ theory. Poirot admitted his mistake. As we rushed to the Magnificent in a taxi, I unraveled the true scheme. The ‘full of the moon’ idea was a ruse to divert our attention from the actual theft. Poirot’s nonchalance returned as he joked about not being able to think of everything. At the Magnificent, Mr. Rolf and two Scotland Yard men were investigating. A pale-faced clerk provided the details: Mr. Rolf had left the hotel at 11.15.",1
"""Sir Eustace, he seems convinced of it. And he would be the most informed on the matter."" ""Where is he, by the way?"" I inquired. ""I haven't seen him since we boarded."" ""He claims to be unwell, Sir Eustace, and remains holed up in his cabin,"" Pagett whispered. ""But I believe that's just a ruse. So he can keep a closer eye."" ""Keep a closer eye on what?"" ""Your safety, Sir Eustace. In case of any threat against you."" ""You're quite the optimist, Pagett,"" I remarked. ""I hope your fantasies don't get the best of you. If I were you, I'd attend the ball dressed as a skull or a hangman. It suits your gloomy aesthetic."" With that, he fell silent. I made my way upstairs.",1
"“As Hastings mentioned, bodies have a tendency to emerge unexpectedly.” “Incidentally, a gardener reported seeing a silhouette moving toward the rose-garden on the side of the house. The study's lengthy French window leads out to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim often used that route to enter and exit the house. However, the gardener was quite a distance away, occupied with tending to cucumber frames, and could not confirm if it was his employer's figure or not. Furthermore, he was unable to pinpoint the exact time. It had to be prior to six o'clock, since that is when the gardeners finish their tasks.” “And Mr.",1
"""Excuse me for disturbing you, but could you please unlock Mr. Opalsen’s room for me?” The woman willingly got up, and we followed her back down the corridor. Mr. Opalsen’s room was situated across from his wife’s room. The chambermaid used her pass-key to unlock the door, and we entered. Before she left, Poirot stopped her. “Wait a moment; have you ever seen a card like this among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings?” He handed her a plain white card, which had a glossy appearance. The maid examined it closely. “No, sir, I haven’t. But the valet usually handles the gentlemen’s rooms.” “I understand. Thank you.” Poirot took back the card, and the woman left. Poirot seemed to ponder for a moment. Then he nodded sharply. “Please ring the bell three times for the valet, Hastings.” I complied, consumed with curiosity. Meanwhile, Poirot emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor and began searching through its contents. Soon after, the valet answered the bell. Poirot asked him the same question, and handed him the card to inspect. However, the valet had never seen a card of that quality among Mr. Opalsen’s possessions. Poirot thanked him, and he left, casting a curious glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the mess on the floor. He couldn’t have missed overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful words as he gathered the torn papers back up: “And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .”",1
"Black responded promptly, showing no signs of hesitation or guilt. His word associations from 'Day' to 'Night' and from 'Place' to 'Name' were typical. When I mentioned 'Bernard,' there was no recognition, indicating he was not familiar with the local doctor.",1
"I stood up abruptly. Harry was waiting outside on the veranda. ""Get dressed, Anne, and come outside. I need to talk to you."" I quickly put on some clothes and stepped out into the cool night air, still and fragrant, with its soft texture. Harry motioned for me to follow him away from the house. His face was pale and determined, his eyes ablaze. ""Anne, do you remember telling me once that women often do things they dislike for someone they care about?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, curious about what was to come. He pulled me into his arms. ""Anne, come away with me tonight. Back to Rhodesia, back to the island. I can't stand all this nonsense. I can't wait any longer for you."" I pulled away slightly. ""And what about my fancy French dresses?"" I joked. Harry never knows when I'm serious or teasing. ""Forget about your dresses. Do you think I care about that? I'm more likely to want to take them off you. You're not going anywhere. You're mine. If I let you go, I might lose you. I'm never sure about you. You're coming with me tonight, no matter what."" He kissed me passionately, barely letting me catch my breath. ""I can't be without you any longer, Anne. I can't. I hate all this wealth. Let Race have it. Come on, let's go."" ""What about my toothbrush?"" I hesitated. ""You can buy a new one. I know I'm crazy, but please, come!"" He stormed off at a brisk pace. I followed him like a meek Barotsi woman, without a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that I struggled to keep up. ""Harry,"" I finally said in a timid voice, ""are we walking all the way to Rhodesia?"" He spun around, laughing loudly, and scooped me up in his arms. ""I'm madly in love, darling, I know it. But I adore you so much."" ""We're both mad. And, oh Harry, you never asked, but I'm not sacrificing anything at all! I wanted to come!"" And that was the beginning of our life on the island. In front of me, on the rough table, lies a letter from Suzanne. Dear Friends, I'm not surprised at all. All our talk of Paris and dresses made me feel like you'd disappear one day to get married in a gypsy fashion. But you truly are a couple of lunatics! Renouncing a fortune is ridiculous. Colonel Race wanted to discuss it, but I convinced him to wait. He can manage the estate for Harry just fine. Enjoy your honeymoon, lunatics, and let it be a long one. And think of me sometimes, enjoying the good life! Love, Suzanne. P.S. I'm sending you frying-pans as a gift, and some pâté de foie gras to remember me by. Another letter arrived later, from Bolivia. Dear Anne, I couldn't resist writing. I'm sending you my diary. There's nothing for Race, but you might enjoy it. Use it for your writing. I suggest writing about the criminals I've met. I bear no grudge towards you. I've started anew and things are going well. By the way, if you see Arthur Minks, tell him I haven't forgotten. You'll see what you've missed in not marrying me. Yours, Eustace. Harry was enraged. It's the one thing we don't agree on. To him, Sir Eustace was a murderer. But I think there's more to the story. Sir Eustace's attempts on my life were puzzling. I believe he had kind feelings towards me, but his fear led him to act recklessly. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina, she deserved her fate. Men do questionable things for wealth, but women shouldn't manipulate for personal gain. I can forgive Sir Eustace, but never Nadina. Never! The other day, while unpacking, I found a piece of the Daily Budget with ""The Man in the Brown Suit."" It feels like a lifetime ago. My son, playing in the sun, reminds me of the past. He's quite a character, much like his father. Suzanne once asked if his head was dolichocephalic or brachycephalic. I couldn't let that slide. I replied simply: ""Platycephalic!"" And so it began, on a day in early June, with a chance encounter on a train. The lady exclaimed, ""Hell!"" and caught my attention. She was bold and impudent, a curious mix of child and woman. We chatted, and I learned she was an actress with a unique show. Her infectious personality and tales of her life kept me captivated. Our conversation continued, passing through Amiens, with memories of the war. She shared her love for crime stories, and I recounted Poirot's triumphs. The train arrived in Calais before we knew it.",1
"""Oh, Minks really outdid himself with Miss Pettigrew. And his impression of me is surprisingly spot-on,"" Mr. Smith remarked.  ""Curious about something,"" I interjected.  ""Go on,"" Mr. Smith encouraged.  ""How did you manage to get Pagett to hire her?""  ""Simple really. Ran into Pagett at the Trade Commissioner's office, or maybe it was the Chamber of Mines. Told him there was an urgent call for him from a government department, and that she was the chosen one. Pagett fell for it hook, line, and sinker.""  ""Quite candid,"" I observed, eyeing him carefully.  ""No reason not to be,"" Mr. Smith replied confidently.  I couldn't shake off the unease that lingered after his response.",1
"""Vegetable soup, baked salmon, beef tenderloin, and a chocolate soufflé. What time? Around eight o’clock, I reckon. Sorry, but the plates and bowls have already been cleaned. Unfortunate. Were you considering finger-prints, perhaps?"" ""Not quite,"" Poirot replied, flashing a mysterious grin. ""I am more intrigued by Count Foscatini's appetite. Did he sample each dish?"" ""He did; although I can't confirm how much he consumed of each. All the plates were dirty, and the dishes empty except for the chocolate soufflé. There was still a considerable portion of that remaining.""",1
"""The ground floor windows are all secured with iron shutters,” the commissary pointed out. Poirot gestured towards a first floor window. “Isn't that the bedroom window we just left? And look, there's a tree nearby that would provide easy access.” “True,” the commissary conceded. “But they would have left footprints in the flower-bed if they had climbed up.” I understood his reasoning. Two oval flower-beds with scarlet geraniums flanked the steps to the front door.",1
"By applying pressure to the second brick from the edge, the concealed compartment was revealed. It had been a complex creation, meticulously crafted by the elderly man. Our source, a man named Coghan, was a tall, thin individual with a gray mustache. He appeared to be quite astute. We made our way back to Crabtree Manor with enthusiasm, securing the study door before implementing our newfound information. The bricks showed no visible markings, but upon pressing as instructed, a hidden hollow was exposed. Poirot eagerly reached in, only to find his expression shift from satisfaction to shock. All that remained in his hand was a burnt piece of paper. Apart from that, the compartment was empty. ""Sacré!"" Poirot exclaimed in frustration. ""Someone beat us to it."" We studied the paper scrap intently. It was clearly a fragment of our target. A section of Baker's signature was visible, but no hint of the will's contents. Poirot leaned back, his perplexed expression bordering on comical if not for our disappointment. ""I do not comprehend this,"" he muttered. ""Who destroyed it? And why?"" ""The Bakers?"" I proposed. ""Why? Neither will benefits them, and they are more likely to remain employed by Miss Marsh rather than a hospital owning the property. How could destroying the will benefit anyone? The hospitals, yes; but one cannot suspect institutions."" ""Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,"" I suggested. Poirot stood up, brushing off his knees meticulously. ""That is a possibility,"" he conceded. ""One of your more reasonable observations, Hastings. Well, we have reached a dead end here. We have exhausted all possible efforts. We have successfully matched wits with the late Andrew Marsh, but unfortunately, his niece gains nothing from our triumph."" We rushed to the station immediately and barely caught a train to London, though not the main express. Poirot was dejected and dissatisfied. I, on the other hand, was weary and drifted off in a corner. Suddenly, as we departed from Taunton, Poirot let out a sharp cry. ""Quick, Hastings! Wake up and leap! Leap, I say!"" Before I could comprehend the situation, we were standing on the platform, hatless and without our bags, watching the train vanish into the darkness. I was livid. But Poirot paid no heed. ""Fool that I have been!"" he exclaimed. ""Triple fool! I will never again boast about my little grey cells!"" ""At least that's a relief,"" I grumbled. ""But what is all this about?"" As usual, Poirot ignored me completely when engrossed in his own thoughts. ""I have completely disregarded the tradesmen's records! Yes, but where? Where? No matter, I cannot be mistaken. We must go back immediately."" Though easier said than done.",1
"""Ah, we have some knowledge between us, don't we?"" M. Hautet chuckled, bidding us farewell. Poirot wasted no time in expressing his disdain for Hautet's intelligence, calling him an ""imbecile."" As we left, we encountered Giraud, exuding confidence and arrogance. Poirot confidently stated that the end of the case was near, to which Giraud agreed, smugly. Poirot then boldly proclaimed Jack Renauld's innocence, challenging Giraud to a bet. Despite Giraud's initial reluctance, he eventually agreed, acknowledging his disrespectful behavior towards Poirot. The encounter with Giraud only fueled Poirot's determination to solve the case and save Bella from the consequences of her actions. Gabriel Stonor joined us, showing his support for Jack Renauld and his belief in the lad's innocence.",1
"I arrived at his house the next evening, expecting him to have received a response to his cable. The maid informed me that Mr. Carton was out, but would be back the following day. This raised my suspicions immediately. After some quick investigation, I discovered that he was actually scheduled to depart for England on the Kilmorden Castle in just two days. I hurried to catch the same boat, with no intention of alerting Carton to my presence on board.",1
"""I regret what happened to my sister.""  ""I am devastated!"" ""That's a good start!"" ""Let me continue. I must say, despite my devastation, I can cope quite well with her absence.""  I nodded politely. However, the mysterious woman frowned and shook her head.  ""Stop it. I prefer the 'dignified disapproval' act. Oh, your expression! 'Out of place,' it screamed. And you were spot on, although, to be fair, it's hard to discern these days. Not everyone can differentiate between a countess and a queen. There you go, I bet I've surprised you once more! You really are a product of the wilderness.""",1
"“Why have you arrested him?” “Do you really want me to tell you?” “It would be polite of you to do so.” Giraud hesitated. He wanted to be rude, but also wanted to show his superiority. “You think I’ve made a mistake, don’t you?” he mocked. “It wouldn’t surprise me,” Poirot replied with a hint of malice. Giraud’s face reddened. “Fine, come inside. See for yourself.” He opened the door to the salon, and we entered, leaving Jack Renauld with the other men. “Now, M. Poirot,” Giraud said sarcastically, placing his hat on the table, “let me enlighten you on detective work. I will demonstrate our modern methods.” “Very well,” Poirot said, getting ready to listen. “I will show you how attentively the Old Guard can listen,” he added, closing his eyes briefly. “Rest assured, I won’t fall asleep. I will pay close attention.” “I quickly saw through the Chilian charade. It was a smokescreen. Two men were involved, not mysterious foreigners. I learned of Jack Renauld’s quarrel with his father and the threats he made. The motive was clear. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night. He hid this fact, raising suspicion. Another victim was stabbed with the same dagger. We know when the dagger was stolen. Jack Renauld arrived from Cherbourg, the only one who could have taken it. I have eliminated all other suspects,” Giraud explained. Poirot interjected, “You are mistaken. There is one other person who could have taken the dagger.” “You mean M. Stonor? He arrived in an automobile from Calais. Jack Renauld arrived by train. An hour passed before he appeared at the house. He likely saw Captain Hastings and his companion leave the shed, entered himself, took the dagger, and stabbed his accomplice,” Giraud reasoned. “Who was already dead!” Poirot pointed out. “Perhaps he didn’t realize that. He might have thought the man was sleeping. They probably had a meeting arranged. Either way, he knew this fake murder would complicate things. And it did,” Giraud concluded. Poirot gazed at him steadily. “That is my argument,” Giraud stated. “What do you have to say to that?” “Just one thing you overlooked,” Poirot replied. “What’s that?” “The lead piping,” Poirot mentioned before leaving the room. Jack Renauld was still in the hall, looking stunned, as we came out of the salon. Mrs. Renauld descended the stairs, seeing her son flanked by the police, she stopped in shock. “Jack,” she gasped. “Jack, what’s happening?” He glanced at her, his face grim. “They’ve arrested me, mother.” She let out a cry, then fainted. We rushed to help her. Poirot predicted, “She has a serious head wound, and may be unconscious for a week.” Denise and Françoise took care of her as Poirot left the house, lost in thought.",1
"“Seek the truth within, not without,” Poirot said. “Could you really solve a case without leaving your chair?” Japp challenged. “I can, given the facts are presented to me. I am a consulting specialist,” Poirot replied confidently. Japp bet Poirot that he couldn't locate Mr. Davenheim within a week. Mr. Davenheim disappeared after leaving his house and was last seen by his wife. A man named Lowen had an appointment with Mr. Davenheim, but he never showed up. The police were baffled by his disappearance.",1
"What an incredible chance for a distinguished thief to seize! Look, Hastings, at that robust woman standing by the pillar. She is practically covered in jewels,” I turned my head to see. “Why,” I gasped, “that’s Mrs. Opalsen.” “You know her?” “A little. Her husband is a wealthy stockbroker who struck it rich in the recent oil frenzy.” Later that evening, we bumped into the Opalsens in the lounge, and I made the introductions to Poirot. We engaged in conversation for a while, eventually joining them for coffee. Poirot complimented some of the more expensive gems adorning the lady's chest, and she lit up immediately. “It’s a passion of mine, Mr.",1
"I spotted what appeared to be an empty space at first glance, but after a thorough search, my hand grasped a solid paper cylinder nestled in a corner of the cupboard. It was a roll of Kodak films, a valuable discovery. Despite the possibility that it belonged to Sir Eustace Pedler, I doubted it. The red paper looked too new.",1
"It was clear that he had no issue with me joining Sir Eustace on the boat. He needed me free for the time being. Nadina had failed to bring the jewels to the rendezvous, which threw a wrench in their plans. My suspicion was that Carton was the one in possession of them, stashing them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle. The 'Colonel' was desperate to locate them, fearing for his safety until they were back in his hands. As for the whereabouts of the diamonds, only Carton knew the answer.",1
"I peered through the keyhole, expecting to hear voices. One of them belonged to the big Dutchman, just as I suspected. The other man remained hidden from my limited view. Suddenly, the second man stood up to pour himself a drink. His back, dressed in black and proper attire, came into sight. Even before he turned around, I recognized him. It was Mr. Chichester! As I listened closely, I heard the big man's voice. ""All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?"" Chichester responded, his tone no longer resembling his usual clerical voice. It was no wonder I didn't recognize him at first.",1
"""We positioned ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had directed, gazing out at the ocean. The distant sounds of the bathers could be heard from the sandy shore. The sea appeared a light shade of blue, evoking memories of our arrival in Merlinville and Poirot's remark about my demeanor. It felt like ages had passed, though it had only been three days. ""Focus, mon ami,"" Poirot urged. ""Organize your thoughts. Approach this methodically. Order is key to success.""",1
"He appeared less sunburnt than the rest, but with a weariness in his eyes that added years to his young face. Struggling to maintain composure under pressure, he introduced Dr. Ames, a competent man in his thirties with hints of grey in his hair, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a slim young man sporting horn-rimmed glasses. Soon after, Harper left followed by Dr. Tosswill, leaving us with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames.",1
"January, a month filled with fog and detestable memories. ""It must be for profit, eh?"" She stood proudly in front of him, a woman with the wit and courage to double-cross the chief. The De Beer diamonds, a fine haul worth a hundred thousand pounds, were the key to her power. Working under the 'Colonel's' orders, she saw her chance to keep some unique South American stones as leverage. Now, after all these years, she demands her price, a staggering one at that. The Count, impressed by her cunning, warned her of the danger of blackmailing the 'Colonel'. But she was unafraid, confident in her abilities. The man she once feared is dead, killed in the war. As she spoke of her past, the Count couldn't help but wonder if she truly knew the 'Colonel' as well as she believed.",1
"The mansion and its contents had been liquidated, with the proceeds just enough to settle our outstanding debts. Despite my efforts, I had yet to secure a job. Not that I was particularly eager to do so! I held a firm belief that if I sought out excitement, it would inevitably find me. I maintained that one's desires would always come to fruition. This philosophy of mine was on the brink of being confirmed. It was the beginning of January, precisely the 8th. I was on my way back from an unsuccessful meeting with a woman who advertised for a secretary-companion, but in reality was in need of a laborious cleaner willing to toil twelve hours a day for a measly £25 annually.",1
"I couldn't help but smirk with hidden satisfaction. I may not be a complete fool. “Regardless,” I stated seriously, “I believe we will.” “And why is that?” I shook my head, struggling to articulate the emotion behind my words. “I never want to lay eyes on you again,” he declared abruptly and aggressively. It was incredibly impolite, yet I merely chuckled quietly and slipped into the shadows. I heard him begin to follow me, then stop abruptly, a single word drifting down the deck. I believe it was a whispered “witch”!  (Excerpt from the personal journal of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Mount Nelson Hotel,  Cape Town. Escaping the Kilmorden was an immense relief.",1
"""Renauld, a wealthy man, was set to leave half of his fortune to his son upon his death. Marthe Daubreuil, a cunning woman, saw an opportunity to secure wealth through marriage to the son. She plotted to eliminate Renauld and take her place as the heir's wife. With a calculated plan in mind, she waited for the right moment to strike, armed with a dagger given to her by the young heir himself. Poirot considered the possibility of another suspect, Bella Duveen, but ultimately concluded that Marthe Daubreuil was the most likely culprit, with her motives and means aligning perfectly with the crime.""",1
"Unconsciously, a sense of relief washed over me. My attention shifted to the crowd around me. Among them, one woman stood out. She appeared to be around thirty years old, average in height, and possessed a striking fair complexion complemented by round, dimpled cheeks and piercing blue eyes. Her attire, while simple, exuded a certain elegance that hinted at its origin in Paris. With a demeanor that was both pleasant and confident, she effortlessly commanded the attention of the ship's crew. They scurried back and forth, carrying out her every request. A special deck-chair was reserved for her, surrounded by an endless array of cushions. Despite changing her mind multiple times on its placement, she maintained an aura of grace and allure throughout.",1
"His account matched Miss Farquhar's in every detail. Once he had recounted his tale, Poirot picked up the conversation with a query. “What specifically prompted you to realize that the bonds had been taken, Mr. Ridgeway?” His response was tinged with bitterness. “It was plain as day, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn't have overlooked it. My cabin trunk was partially pulled out from beneath the bunk, bearing scratches and cuts from their attempts to break the lock.” “Yet I was under the impression that it had been unlocked with a key?” “Indeed. They attempted to force it, but to no avail.”",1
"As she served me a hearty bowl of soup, I eagerly consumed every last drop. Despite my attempts to engage her in conversation, she simply smiled, nodded, and spoke in a language I did not understand. It was clear she had no knowledge of English. Abruptly, she rose from her seat and retreated respectfully as Harry Rayburn made his entrance. With a dismissive nod, he signaled for her to leave, leaving us alone in the room. A smile graced his face as he addressed me. ""Feeling better today?"" ""Yes, much improved, but still feeling disoriented. Where exactly am I?"" ""You're situated on a remote island along the Zambesi River, approximately four miles upstream from the majestic Falls."" ""Do my companions know of my whereabouts?"" I inquired anxiously. He shook his head solemnly. ""I must find a way to inform them.""",1
"""They're always so helpful, sometimes a bit too much so. You ask for directions, expecting a simple answer, but instead they overwhelm you with a barrage of well-intentioned guidance. And if you still look lost, they'll kindly take you by the arm and escort you all the way there."" ""Have you encountered this in Paris, Pagett?"" inquired Sir Eustace, directing his question to his secretary. Pagett's response seemed oddly unsettled. He stuttered and blushed, ""Oh, yes, um, quite so, indeed."" Quickly making an excuse, he abruptly stood up and left the room.",1
"""Like a meticulous architect, he meticulously constructs his case, layer by layer. But the obvious eludes him, the crucial details slipping through his grasp. Let the investigation commence."" Poirot systematically inspected each piece of evidence, methodically sorting through the contents of every drawer. The process was tedious and uneventful, delving into mundane items like collars, pajamas, and socks. Suddenly, a faint purring sound outside caught my attention, injecting a surge of adrenaline. ""Poirot!"" I exclaimed. ""A car has just pulled up. Giraud, Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes have arrived.""",1
"""He attempted to sell the ring at five different locations before finally finding success at the last one. With the money, he proceeded to get heavily intoxicated and ended up physically attacking a police officer, resulting in his arrest. Visiting Bow Street with Miller, I had the opportunity to see him in a more sober state. We insinuated the possibility of murder charges, which clearly shook him to the core. According to his story, he had been at Entfield races on Saturday, although his main source of income was likely from selling stolen goods rather than gambling. It was evident that luck was not on his side that day.""",1
"We're heading to Yardly Chase this Friday to visit Lord and Lady Yardly,"" she said, triggering a faint memory in my mind. There was gossip about them from a few years back - a scandal involving Lord Yardly and some lady friends during their visit to the States. But there was more to it, rumors linking Lady Yardly to a Hollywood ""movie"" star named Gregory B. Rolf. Miss Marvell leaned in, whispering, ""I have a secret to share, Monsieur Poirot.""",1
"""Reflecting on the new possibilities that Poirot's deductions had revealed, I pondered the enigmatic references to the flower bed and the wrist watch. Initially dismissed as trivial, these clues now unveiled the intricate web of the case. I admired Poirot's astute methods, piecing together fragments of information to solve the mystery. His wise words echoed in my mind: 'Method, my friend! Method! Organize your facts, your thoughts. Even the smallest detail must be examined closely, not discarded if it does not fit.'""",1
"“Women, always causing trouble with their film stunts,” Poirot remarked. After a brief pause, he stood up abruptly. “Are you heading back to Yardly Chase now? Good. Don’t speak a word to anyone, but expect us there this evening around five.” The nobleman, looking confused, agreed to Poirot’s plan to safeguard his diamond. Later that day, we reached Yardly Chase just in time for the warm welcome of the blazing log fire in the panelled hall.",1
"Rayburn was taken aback by the man's identity - Guy Pagett. As soon as the realization hit him, he muttered in disbelief. Despite his astonishment, I couldn't help but feel a sense of superiority. When he turned to me in surprise, questioning if I had recognized Pagett during the attack, I assured him that I had not. His suspicion lingered as he probed about my involvement and knowledge in the matter. With a smile, I hinted that I knew more than he thought. Suddenly, he grabbed my arm with such force that it caused me to flinch. In a hoarse voice, he demanded to know where I had acquired the name Lucas.",1
"""Did he confess to leaving the study?"" ""At first, he adamantly denied ever stepping foot outside. However, the maid's testimony was unwavering, forcing him to concoct a feeble excuse about inspecting a rare rose through the window. A flimsy alibi, indeed! And now, new damning evidence has emerged. Mr. Davenheim's distinctive gold ring, adorned with a solitary diamond, mysteriously turned up at a pawn shop in London on Saturday night. The culprit? A known criminal by the name of Billy Kellett, who has a rap sheet including a three-month stint behind bars for stealing an elderly man's watch last autumn.""",1
"I told him I had no idea where the diamonds were and that I wouldn't help him in any way. He threatened me, saying that he had a man downstairs who could take care of any problems that arose. I felt trapped, but I knew I had to outsmart him. I reluctantly agreed to write a letter to Harry, luring him to the location. As I handed the letter over, I knew I had to come up with a plan to turn the tables on Sir Eustace. I made sure to include a hidden message in the letter that only Harry would understand. It was a risky move, but I had to trust that Harry would be able to decipher it and come to my rescue. It was my only hope in this dangerous game of cat and mouse.",1
"""I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck. As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.” “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.” “What?” “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.” He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending. He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?” His eyes challenged us. “But I Hercule Poirot tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within here!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot so and I say: the Prime Minister is there! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.” And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously contemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness. Finally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the window. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned for my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the daily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay alongside the quay. Suddenly I was aroused by Poirot’s voice close to my elbow.""",1
"""But the chief inspector shattered my illusion by stepping forward with an abrupt outburst: “What in the world have my officers been up to? I specifically instructed them to keep everyone away from the scene without the proper credentials!” The figure on the ground twisted to look back. “I happen to have the proper credentials,” he stated, getting up slowly. “Ah, my dear Chief Inspector Lestrade,” exclaimed the commissary. “I wasn't aware you had arrived. The district attorney has been anxiously waiting for your presence.” While he talked, I scrutinized the newcomer with intense curiosity.""",1
"""Shortly after, I heard a commotion in the house that seemed to startle them, leading to my husband being forcibly taken to my room in a state of undress."" ""Excuse me,"" Poirot interjected, ""but is there any other way out of the dressing room?"" ""No, sir, the only exit is through the connecting door to my room. They pushed my husband through, the smaller man leading the way, while the taller man followed closely behind, still holding a dagger. Paul attempted to break free to reach me. I could see the fear in his eyes. He turned to his captors. 'I need to talk to her,' he pleaded.""",1
"""Blair? I launched myself towards her, my excitement palpable. “The films! The ones passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would someone return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No, they were a message. The films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Do you still have it?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She handed it to me. It was a standard round tin cylinder, the kind films are packed in for the tropics. I took it with a trembling hand, but as I did so, my heart skipped a beat. It was noticeably heavier than expected. With shaky fingers, I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that sealed it air-tight. I removed the lid, and a cascade of dull glassy pebbles spilled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, disappointed. “Pebbles?” Suzanne exclaimed. The excitement in her voice thrilled me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!” Diamonds! I gazed, mesmerized, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up a piece that, despite its weight, could have been a shard of a broken bottle. “Are you certain, Suzanne?” “Oh, absolutely, my dear. I’ve seen rough diamonds too many times to have any doubts. They're exquisite, Anne, and some of them are truly unique, I would say. There’s a story behind these.” “The story we heard tonight,” I interjected. “You mean?” “Colonel Race’s tale. It can’t be a mere coincidence. He shared it for a reason.” “To observe its impact, you think?” I nodded. “Its impact on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” Yet, as the words left my lips, a doubt crept in. Was it Sir Eustace who was being tested, or was the story told for my benefit? I recalled the sense of being deliberately interrogated on that previous night. For some unknown reason, Colonel Race was suspicious. But how did he fit into all this? What possible link could he have to the situation? “Who is Colonel Race?” I inquired. “That’s quite the question,” Suzanne mused. “He’s known as a big-game hunter, and, as he mentioned tonight, he was distantly related to Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this journey. He travels to and from Africa frequently. There’s a general belief that he does work for the Secret Service. I don’t know if it’s true. He’s certainly an enigmatic figure.” “I assume he inherited a substantial sum as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be wealthy. He would make a splendid match for you.” “I can’t pursue him with you on board the ship,” I chuckled. “Oh, the woes of married women!” “We do have an advantage,” Suzanne said smugly. “And everyone knows how devoted I am to Clarence, my husband. It’s so safe and enjoyable to flirt with a devoted wife.” “Clarence must be thrilled to be married to someone like you.” “Well, I’m not the easiest to live with! Nonetheless, he can always retreat to the Foreign Office, where he adjusts his eyeglass and dozes off in a large armchair. We could send him a cable to gather all the information he has on Race.""",1
"Poirot was intrigued by my clever solution to the case. He acknowledged its ingenuity, but warned me about the ominous influence of the Tomb. Despite my skepticism, Poirot insisted that we depart for Egypt the next day. I was taken aback by his sudden decision, but Poirot was determined. His face reflected a mix of bravery and despair.",1
"""He’s departing Cape Town today, to meet Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “Got it,” I replied calmly. “And the children, where are they?” “I assume Sir Eustace has taken them along.” I pondered on the situation. “Well,” I finally stated, “it’s inconvenient but it’s secure. Let’s refrain from taking any action for now.” Suzanne gave me a small grin. “You’re not one for inactivity, are you, Anne?” “Not particularly,” I honestly confessed. The only option I had was to obtain a timetable and check when Guy Pagett’s train would be passing through Kimberley. I discovered that it was scheduled to arrive at 5.""",1
"I reached my destination early the next morning, greeted by a mysterious short Dutchman with a black beard. Without delay, we hopped into a waiting car as the sound of distant gunfire echoed through the air. It seemed that there was a battle raging in Jo’burg. Our final destination appeared to be somewhere in the suburbs, as we navigated through twists and turns, taking detours to avoid the approaching sounds of war. The tension was palpable as we finally arrived at a rundown building.",1
"""Possibly the old man destroyed it himself,"" I proposed. Poirot stood up, brushing off his knees meticulously. ""It's a possibility,"" he acknowledged. ""A rather astute observation, Hastings. We've exhausted all our options here. We've done everything humanly possible.""",1
"""They refused to acknowledge any connection to the Marlow case, so I decided to keep the document. Plus, the inspector's attitude irritated me."" ""Narrow-minded fool. Well, my dear, here's my offer. Keep pursuing this lead of yours. If you find anything worth publishing, send it over and you'll have a shot. The Daily Budget always has a place for true talent.

"""Shall we go and listen to our guest's specific issue, Hastings? Please convey my apologies."" Roger Havering, a smartly dressed man of around forty, appeared agitated with a haggard face. ""Captain Hastings? You work with Monsieur Poirot, correct? He must accompany me to Derbyshire today."" ""I'm sorry, but that's not feasible,"" I said. ""Poirot is bedridden with the flu."" Disappointment washed over his face. ""Oh, that's a major setback for me.""",1
"I kept my distance from Carton while on the boat, pretending to be ill and staying in my cabin. When we arrived in London, I followed him to an hotel and then to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. Anita Grünberg, also known as Nadina, unexpectedly appeared and expressed interest in a property called The Mill House in Marlow. I suspected a prearranged meeting between her and Carton. Following them to the Hyde Park Hotel, I decided to approach Carton at the Tube station. In the chaos that ensued, I managed to search his pockets and found a piece of paper with an appointment on the Kilmorden Castle for the 22nd. After hastily removing my disguise, I followed Nadina to Marlow and found her dead in the house. Realizing that I would be framed for the murder, I laid low until I overheard a conversation that led me to attach myself as a secretary to Sir Eustace Pedler. I began to doubt if he was truly the 'Colonel' behind it all. The mystery deepened when I learned that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the time of the murder, casting doubt on my previous suspicions.",1
"Lord Estair eagerly tore open the heavily sealed envelope brought by a young officer. The decoded telegram revealed shocking news - the second car and the secretary, Daniels, were found chloroformed, gagged, and bound in an abandoned farm near C. The French police, Scotland Yard, and the military were still tirelessly working to solve the mystery, but so far, nothing conclusive had been discovered.",1
"""Miss Beddingfeld, I would be happy to share, but there are urgent matters"" she said. ""I will inform Sir Eustace,"" she threatened. His nerves were clearly on edge. ""What do you wish to know?"" he asked resignedly. ""The pictures, the olive trees,"" she replied. ""Do you speak Italian?"" she inquired. ""Not a word, but with hall porters and guides,"" he explained.",1
"The solution didn't sit right with me. As I explained to you, Hastings, a seasoned expert like myself enjoys a worthy opponent. One must accept crimes as they come, not as one wishes them to be. It seemed improbable that Bella Duveen would be casually wandering around with a souvenir paper-knife, but perhaps she had been planning revenge on Jack Renauld all along. Even after she confessed to the murder, something didn't sit well with me. I remained unsatisfied, my friend. Unsatisfied.",1
"""In fact, a friend from the City tipped me off about a lucrative opportunity. With money to spare, a weekend at the Grand Metropolitan could be just what we need."" ""I graciously accept your offer. Your kindness towards an old man does not go unnoticed. Such kindness truly showcases the importance of our little grey cells. Sometimes, I myself forget that."" I couldn't help but feel slighted. It seems Poirot may occasionally undervalue my intelligence.",1
"""It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action.",1
"I scoured every corner, my frustration escalating. As I slammed shut the final book, the truth hit me like a ton of bricks - Kilmorden Castle did not exist. A perplexing setback. Who would fabricate such a name and jot it down? Ridiculous! A new theory emerged - perhaps it was a pretentious mansion in the outskirts, its grandiose title a product of the owner's imagination. But if that were the case, locating it would prove to be a formidable challenge.",1
"""I think that's the room where we'll find Jack Renauld,"" I said as Madame Daubreuil opened the door for us. She mentioned that Jack was stable, but suggested we check on him ourselves. Leading us upstairs, we entered a bedroom where Marthe Daubreuil was quietly embroidering by a table with a dimly lit lamp. Motioning for silence, she pointed to Jack Renauld, who was sleeping restlessly with a flushed face and turning his head from side to side. ""Will the doctor be returning soon?"" Poirot whispered. ""Not unless we call for him. Let him rest,"" Madame Daubreuil responded.",1
"""He passed away without a will, leaving his considerable wealth to a distant relative he barely had any connection with."" The Colonel stopped speaking, prompting a flurry of reactions and inquiries from the group. Miss Beddingfeld appeared to be fixated on something, causing her to turn around in her seat. Following her lead, I also turned my head. Our new secretary, Rayburn, had quietly entered the room. Despite his sun-kissed complexion, his expression was ashen, as if he had just seen a ghost. It was clear that Race's narrative had deeply affected him. Sensing our eyes on him, he quickly turned and vanished from sight.",1
"""Without a doubt, he had no qualms about me joining Sir Eustace on the boat. He wasn’t eager to see me caught right away. Nadina didn’t have the jewels with her at the meeting spot, as expected. Carton most likely had them and stashed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle. They hoped I had a clue to their whereabouts. As long as the ‘Colonel’ didn’t have the diamonds, he was still at risk, hence his urgency to obtain them by any means necessary. Where Carton hid them, if he did, I have no idea.” “That’s a different story,” I responded. “My story. And I’m about to share it with you now.” Harry paid close attention as I recounted the events detailed in these pages. What surprised him the most was that the diamonds had been in my possession, or rather Suzanne’s, all along. After hearing his side of the story, I understood the purpose behind Carton’s scheme, or rather Nadina’s, since I was sure she was the mastermind. Surprise attacks against her or her husband would not lead to the capture of the diamonds. The secret was locked in her mind, and the ‘Colonel’ was unlikely to guess that they had been entrusted to an ocean steward! Harry’s innocence of the old theft accusation seemed likely. The more serious charge was what halted our progress. He couldn’t come forward to prove his innocence. Our main focus was on the true identity of the ‘Colonel.’ Was he really Guy Pagett? “I would say he was, except for one thing,” Harry remarked. “It seems highly likely that Pagett was the one who killed Anita Grünberg in Marlow, which suggests that he is indeed the ‘Colonel,’ given the nature of Anita’s business. However, the fact that someone tried to harm you on the night of your arrival here complicates matters. Pagett was left behind in Cape Town and couldn’t have arrived here before Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any associates in this area, and all his plans were centered on Cape Town. He may have sent instructions to someone in Johannesburg, who could have caught the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but the instructions would have to be very precise for that message to be delivered.” We fell silent for a moment, before Harry continued slowly: “You mentioned that Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you heard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew. Where was Colonel Race?” “I couldn’t find him anywhere.” “Did he have any reason to believe that you and I were friendly?” “It’s possible,” I replied, recalling our conversation after leaving the Matoppos. “He’s a commanding figure,” I added, “but not what I envision as the ‘Colonel.’ Besides, the idea is absurd. He’s part of the Secret Service.” “How do we know that for sure? It’s easy to hint at such things. No one refutes it, and the rumor spreads until it’s taken as fact. It provides a cover for questionable actions. Anne, do you trust Race?” “I have mixed feelings. I’m drawn to him but also wary of him. I do know one thing, I’m always a little on edge around him.” “He was in South Africa during the Kimberley robbery,” Harry stated slowly. “Yet, he informed Suzanne about the ‘Colonel’ and his pursuit in Paris.” “A very clever deception.” “But where does Pagett fit in? Is he working for Race?” “Maybe,” Harry mused, “he’s not involved at all.” “What?” “Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s version of that night on the Kilmorden?” “Yes, through Sir Eustace.” I recounted it. Harry listened intently. “He saw a man leaving Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him to the deck. Is that what he said? Now, who had the cabin opposite Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. What if Colonel Race crept up to the deck, failed in his attack on you, then fled around the deck and encountered Pagett coming through the saloon door. He knocked him down and darted inside, shutting the door. We arrived and found Pagett on the floor. How does that sound?” “But he’s certain it was you who struck him,” I pointed out. “What if he saw me running off as he regained consciousness? Wouldn’t he assume I was his attacker? Especially since he thought he was pursuing me all along?” “It’s a possibility,” I said slowly. “But it changes everything. And there are other factors.” “Most of them can be explained. Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it because Pagett was in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen? Would he have been set up as the fall guy if I hadn’t shown up just in time?” “So you think he might be innocent?” “It appears so, but we need to figure out why he was in Marlow.”",1
"""Nothing in my will for you,"" he declared, ""but each year I'm alive, I'll set aside this sum for you to inherit once I'm gone."" Poirot pondered for a moment. ""What did Mr. Marsh do after you signed the second time? Any idea?"" ""He went to settle bills in the village."" Poirot shifted gears. Extending the desk key, he inquired, ""Is this your employer's handwriting?"" There was a slight pause before Baker answered, ""Yes, sir, it is.""",1
"Unknowingly, Mademoiselle Marthe revealed the truth regarding another matter and inadvertently contradicted Jack Renauld. His hesitation was evident when questioned about seeing Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime. After a momentary pause, he confirmed that he did. This raised suspicions of deception. It became imperative for me to speak directly with Mademoiselle Marthe before Renauld could potentially influence her. In just three simple words, she provided me with the crucial information I sought. When inquired whether she was aware of Jack Renauld's presence that night, she simply replied, ""He informed me.""",1
"I wondered what he hoped to discover there. There was a hint of unease in the question. I straightened up. ""I can't say,"" I replied calmly. Giraud stared at me intently. ""He's smart enough not to confide in you,"" he said bluntly. ""Good day. I have things to do."" And with that, he abruptly walked away, leaving me behind. The situation at Villa Geneviève appeared to be at a standstill. Giraud clearly did not want my presence, and it was evident that Jack Renauld felt the same way. I returned to town, took a relaxing bath, and went back to the hotel.",1
"“The body of Mr. Davenheim has not been discovered in our lake, but we did stumble upon his clothes, the very same clothes he was last seen wearing. His valet confirms that no other clothing is missing from the residence. In addition, Lowen has been apprehended. A maid reported seeing him heading towards the study from the rose-garden around 6:15, just before he departed the premises.”",1
"As the wind howled around the house, a sense of unease settled over us. Mrs. Maltravers seemed haunted by her own thoughts, her eyes darting around the room as if expecting something dreadful to happen. Suddenly, a loud knock echoed through the hallway, making us all jump. Poirot sprang to his feet, his eyes scanning the dimly lit room. Mrs. Maltravers let out a gasp, her hand trembling as she pointed towards the door. ""There, do you see him?"" she whispered, her voice filled with fear. But when Poirot turned to look, there was nothing there. Just an empty hallway, shrouded in darkness. The sense of foreboding grew stronger as the night wore on, each creak and groan of the old house sending shivers down our spines. And then, as if on cue, the lights flickered and went out. In the pitch-black silence, a figure materialized before us, glowing with an otherworldly light. Mrs. Maltravers let out a strangled cry, her hand covered in crimson. The truth was laid bare in that moment of darkness, a truth that none of us were prepared to face.",1
"However, I decided against taking that path due to its high risk, and instead, I simply donned my finest hat before heading solemnly into town to speak with our rightfully upset grocer. The journalist from the Daily Budget was the sole young man to ever visit our home. There were moments when I found myself envious of Emily, our young maid, who would casually stroll out with a handsome sailor she was engaged to whenever the opportunity arose. In the meantime, to ""stay in practice"" as she liked to say, she would also go out with the greengrocer's assistant and the pharmacist's aide. I sadly pondered the fact that I had no one to ""keep my hand in"" with.",1
"""Skillfully, he swiftly pulled out his tape measure, and proceeded, quite seriously, to measure a coat hanging in the hallway from the top to the bottom. I had not noticed it there before, and suspected that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a small satisfied sigh, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me outside. “Why did you measure that coat?” I inquired, with some interest, as we strolled down the scorching white road at a relaxed pace. “To see how long it was,” replied my friend calmly. I was annoyed. Poirot’s persistent habit of turning nothing into a mystery never failed to bother me. I fell silent, lost in my own thoughts. Although I hadn't paid much attention to them at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had said to her son now came back to me, filled with a new meaning. “So you didn't sail?” she had remarked, and then had added: “After all, it doesn't matter now.” What did she mean by that? The words were cryptic and significant. Could it be that she knew more than we assumed? She had denied any knowledge of the mysterious task her husband had supposedly entrusted to their son. But was she truly as clueless as she pretended? Could she provide answers if she wanted to, and was her silence part of a calculated and premeditated plan? The more I pondered on it, the more convinced I became that I was onto something. Mrs. Renauld was privy to more than she let on. Her surprise at seeing her son had momentarily given her away. I was certain that she knew, if not the perpetrators, at least the reason behind the crime. But there must be some powerful reasons keeping her quiet. ""You're deep in thought, my friend,"" Poirot interjected, interrupting my musings. ""What's capturing your interest?"" I shared my thoughts with him, confident in my deductions but half-expecting him to mock my suspicions. To my surprise, he nodded thoughtfully. ""You're absolutely right, Hastings. I've always had a feeling that she was hiding something. Initially, I suspected her, if not of planning, at least of being complicit in the crime."" ""You suspected her?"" I exclaimed. ""Indeed! She stands to benefit greatly, in fact, she's the sole beneficiary of this new will. So, naturally, she drew my attention from the start. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity to examine her wrists. I wanted to see if there was a chance that she had tied herself up. Well, I could tell immediately that it wasn't staged, the ropes had actually cut into her flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her acting alone. But it was still plausible for her to have been involved, or to have been the mastermind with an accomplice. Furthermore, her account, as she narrated it, seemed oddly familiar to me - the masked assailants she couldn't identify, the mention of 'the secret' - all of it sounded like something I had heard, or read, before. Another small detail confirmed my suspicion that she wasn't telling the truth.""",1
"I weakly agreed to the man's request for secrecy as we set off on our journey together. Despite some misgivings, I inquired about his name, to which he responded with ""Harry Rayburn."" The situation felt odd, but I went along with it. My thoughts shifted to my recent sea-sickness, a far cry from the heroic heroines of novels. After days of illness, I found myself offered a position as a parlourmaid in South Africa, with a kind gift of money to help me on my way. As I slowly recovered on deck, I observed a confident woman who seemed to command the ship effortlessly. Despite my doubts, I found myself intrigued by her presence. The stop in Madeira brought a glimmer of hope as the sweet scent of violets lifted my spirits, contemplating the remainder of the journey ahead.",1
"""Ah, but the real shock came when the word diamonds slipped out. Mrs. Blair and Miss Beddingfeld couldn't contain their excitement. They turned to Colonel Race in unison. I had visited Kimberley as well, though I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Race was bombarded with inquiries about the mines and the treatment of the natives. He handled each question with ease, demonstrating his expertise on the matter.""",1
"""Such a common name,"" she remarked. ""Exactly,"" he replied with a smirk. Elsa Hardt and her mysterious companion arrived in London from New York, assuming the aliases of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Soon, they discovered that a dangerous secret society, possibly linked to the late Luigi Valdarno, was hot on their trail. In a stroke of cunning, they decided to offer their flat at an unusually low rent. With countless Robinsons searching for housing in the city, they were confident their pursuers would be deceived.",1
"Not for the first time, Colonel Race's inscrutable gaze made me uneasy. His strength was evident as he effortlessly lifted me off the ground. Standing face to face, he demanded to know my true purpose. In a bold move, I turned the tables on him, asking pointedly about his own motivations. His response was cryptic, leaving me with more questions than answers. As we made our way back, a stop for tea turned chaotic as hungry cats surrounded us, their cries piercing the air. My heart went out to them, prompting me to urge Colonel Race to fetch more food. The feline frenzy continued, a stark contrast to the serene beauty of our surroundings.",1
"""Perhaps I should mention Sir Eustace,"" I pondered. He was a prominent figure, his name could hold some sway. However, if they were connected to Pagett, they might see through my deception. It was too risky to bring up Sir Eustace. ""Mrs. Blair, that's who I meant,"" I replied casually. ""A close friend of mine I'm currently staying with."" ""I highly doubt that,"" my captor retorted, a sly smile on his face as he shook his bright orange head. ""You haven't seen her since eleven this morning. And you did receive our message summoning you here during lunchtime."" His words made it clear that my every move had been monitored closely, but I wasn't going to surrender without a fight. ""You're quite clever,"" I retorted. ""But have you ever heard of a little thing called the telephone? Mrs....""",1
"He calmly continued, ""You overheard me mention to Giraud that the details of this crime seemed familiar to me. This implies one of two possibilities - either the mastermind behind the first crime is also behind this one, or our killer read about a famous case that subconsciously influenced the execution of this crime. I will be able to confirm this once I have more information."" As he paused, lost in thought, I brought up Mr. Renauld's cryptic letter. ""The mention of a secret and Santiago is intriguing, isn't it?"" Poirot responded, ""Undoubtedly, there was a hidden aspect to M. Renauld's life. However, I believe 'Santiago' is a diversion, meant to mislead us. The real danger was much closer to home, in France."" His words carried a weight of certainty that was hard to ignore. I raised another point, ""What about the suspicious match and cigarette end near the body?"" A glimmer of amusement crossed Poirot's face. ""Planted deliberately to mislead Giraud or his team. He may be clever, but we shall prove him wrong."" As my mind raced with questions about the masked men, Poirot dismissed the entire narrative as false. ""The truth lies with Madame Renauld, but she refuses to speak. An extraordinary woman, indeed. Her genuine grief at her husband's death convinced me of her innocence."" Reflecting on the complexity of human emotions, I remarked, ""True grief is hard to fake."" Poirot retorted, ""One should never underestimate the acting skills of a criminal.""",1
"He was a skilled gambler, willing to take risks with Fate. Even in defeat, he maintained a smile. ""I doubt our paths will cross again,"" he remarked casually. ""Likely not,"" I replied slowly. ""Farewell then."" ""Farewell."" With a firm grip, he clasped my hand, his intense eyes locking with mine briefly before he departed abruptly. His footsteps resonated along the deck, a sound that lingered, marking his exit from my world. The following hours were far from enjoyable, I must confess.",1
"""I'm certain Colonel Race has taken a liking to you, Anne. Just a few glances from those captivating eyes of yours, and he'll be hooked. Engagements happen quite frequently on a ship - there's not much else to occupy one's time."" ""Marriage is not on my agenda."" ""Is that so?"" Suzanne questioned. ""Why ever not? I find marriage to Clarence quite enjoyable!"" I disregarded her casual tone. ""What I need to understand,"" I asserted, ""is Colonel Race's involvement in all of this. He's definitely connected."" ""Do you believe it was a mere coincidence that he shared that story?"" ""Absolutely not,"" I replied firmly. ""He was observing us all very closely. Remember, only some of the diamonds were recovered, not all.""",1
"""The magistrate bowed. ""These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal."" ""I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever."" M. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: ""This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll."" ""Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?"" ""No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back."" ""Where?"" ""That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave."" ""What?"" ""Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds."" ""And he had been dead how long?"" Dr. Durand answered this. ""I examined the body this morning at ten o'clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously."" ""H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m."" ""Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted."" Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: ""Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation."" The commissary paused. ""And the inmates of the house, monsieur?"" ""There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present."" Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: ""Marchaud!"" The sergent de ville appeared. ""Bring in the woman Françoise."" The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. ""You name is Françoise Arrichet?"" ""Yes, monsieur."" ""You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?"" ""Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine "" The magistrate cut her short. ""Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?"" ""Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself."" ""And last night?"" ""I fastened it as usual."" ""You are sure of that?"" ""I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur."" ""What time would that be?"" ""The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur."" ""What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?"" ""Madame had retired some time before. Denise and Léonie went up with me. Monsieur was still in his study."" ""Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?"" Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. ""What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out "" The magistrate interrupted sharply: ""Cette dame? What lady do you mean?"" ""Why, the lady who came to see him."" ""Had a lady been to see him that evening?"" ""But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well."" ""Who was she? Did you know her?"" A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. ""How should I know who it was?"" she grumbled. ""I did not let her in last night."" ""Aha!"" roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. ""You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings."" ""The police the police,"" grumbled Françoise. ""Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil."" The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment.""",1
"""Orders given in secret!"" I scolded Pagett, stepping away slightly, ""and do try to regulate your breathing. Your theory is preposterous. Why would they choose to convene a clandestine meeting in the dead of night? If they had something to discuss, they could easily do so over a casual meal."" I could tell Pagett remained unconvinced. ""There was definitely some activity last night, Sir Eustace,"" he persisted, ""otherwise why would Rayburn viciously attack me."" ""Are you positive it was Rayburn?"" Pagett seemed absolutely certain of that. That was the only detail in his account that he seemed certain of.",1
"Monsieur Daubreuil was known to speak English fluently, which made it difficult for the magistrate to determine the significance of certain conversations. The magistrate decided to shift the focus to the chauffeur, who had recently been given time off by M. Renauld.",1
"“Keep in mind his preoccupation with the dinner stories. I believe it would be prudent to approach Captain Black and request a retelling of the suicide tale he shared during Tuesday evening's dinner.” Captain Black was forthcoming. “Ah yes, I do recall recounting that anecdote. A man ended his life on a farm using a rook rifle, bullet resting in his brain after passing through the roof of his mouth. Doctors were confounded as there were minimal signs of the incident, save for a trace of blood on his lips. However, how does this relate to Mr.",1
"Jarvis returned. “The man told me to inform you, Sir Eustace, that he is here on behalf of Mr. Milray.” That changed everything. Shortly after, I found myself facing my visitor in the library. He was a muscular young man with a deeply sunburnt face. A scar stretched diagonally from his eye to his jaw, marring an otherwise attractive yet somewhat daring appearance. “Well,” I inquired, “what’s the issue?” “Mr. Milray has sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear sir,” I responded, “I already have a secretary. I do not require another.” “I believe you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your current secretary?” “He is unwell with a bilious attack,” I disclosed. “Are you certain it’s only a bilious attack?” “Certainly. He is prone to them.” My visitor grinned. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will reveal. However, I can inform you, Sir Eustace, that Mr. Milray would not be surprised if there was an attempt to remove your secretary. Oh, do not fear for yourself” I must have shown a momentary alarm “you are not in danger. If your secretary is removed, it would make access to you easier. In any case, Mr. Milray desires me to accompany you. The passage expenses will be our responsibility, naturally, but you will need to handle the passport arrangements, as if you had decided that you required the services of a second secretary.” He appeared resolute. We locked eyes and he outstared me. “Very well,” I acquiesced weakly. “You will keep silent about my joining you.” “Very well,” I repeated. Perhaps it was wiser to have this man by my side, but I had a sense that I was entering dangerous territory. Just when I thought I had found peace! I halted my visitor as he was about to leave. “It might be beneficial for me to know the name of my new secretary,” I remarked sarcastically. He pondered for a moment. “Harry Rayburn appears to be a fitting name,” he remarked. It was an odd way of phrasing it. “Very well,” I agreed for the third time.",1
"I often wonder why anyone would choose to work on a ship. My publishers may be expecting my ""Reminiscences"" soon, but who really reads such things? Probably just old ladies in the suburbs. And what do my reminiscences really amount to? Just stories about meeting a few so-called famous people, with a little help from Pagett. But Pagett is too honest for his own good. He refuses to let me invent anecdotes about people I haven't actually met. I tried to be kind to him, suggesting he relax in the sun instead of working. But he was more concerned about finding a suitable place to work. I joked about him dumping his luggage in my cabin, which only seemed to give him ideas. His stationery trunk, which he insists on lugging around, causes endless problems. I hastily suggested getting an extra cabin, hoping to resolve the issue. Pagett, however, loves to create unnecessary drama. He came to me with a grave expression, claiming there was something strange about Cabin 17. I joked about ghosts, but he insisted it wasn't anything supernatural. Instead, he got into a tussle over the cabin with a man and a girl named Beddingfeld. Clearly, Pagett was feeling aggrieved at losing out to the girl. In the end, he grumbled about other cabins being better but refused to consider them. I couldn't help but stifle a yawn at his complaints.",1
"""After learning that a dark-skinned foreigner had been inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 that morning, my friend Poirot urged me to join him in a late-night vigil armed with my revolver. As we settled in the flat below, waiting patiently, a faint scratching sound caught our attention. Poirot signaled to me, and we moved quietly towards the hall where the noise originated. With precision, we subdued the intruder, disarming him quickly. Poirot whispered urgently in his ear, gaining the man's cooperation. Leading him out of the flat, we encountered a waiting taxi, rendering my revolver unnecessary. As we made our way, I remarked to Poirot that the man was not Japanese, to which he responded with a knowing smile.""",1
"The witness focused on finding her employer tied up and silenced, providing a dramatic description. Like Françoise, she heard nothing at night. Following her was Denise, who noted her employer's recent mood changes. ""He grew increasingly gloomy each day, eating less and always downcast."" Denise suspected the Mafia was after him. ""Certainly, it was the Mafia! Who else but two masked men? A dangerous organization!"" The magistrate acknowledged the possibility calmly.",1
"Poirot smiled, and gripping the letter opener, slit open the envelopes that lay by his plate. ""A bill."" He shook his head despondently, reminiscing about the Yardly diamond case. ""Cheer up, my friend,"" I said, trying to lift his spirits. ""Perhaps a new intriguing case is on the horizon.""",1
"I praised him for his bravery with a glance before claiming my new space. The encounter lifted my spirits. The sea was calm, the days growing warmer. No more sea-sickness! I joined in deck games and signed up for sports. Tea was served on deck, I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with friendly young men. Life felt good. The bugle sounded for dressing and I hurried to my cabin. The stewardess looked worried. “There’s a bad smell in your cabin, miss. You might want to move for the night.” The smell was familiar. Asafœtida! But why was it there? Someone wanted me out. Cabin 17 held a mystery. I recalled the number on my paper. 17, 1, 22. Maybe it was a clue. Tomorrow was the 22nd. I had to stay in the cabin. Something was going to happen at 1 a.m. I waited anxiously, convinced I was on the right track. Six hours to go. I don’t know how I passed the time. I went to bed early, eagerly awaiting what the night would bring.",1
"When my husband passed away, I fell ill. My son, fresh from Oxford, took it upon himself to bring his body back home. Despite my pleas, he has returned to continue his father's work in Egyptology. I confess, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. What if the spirit of the dead King is still restless? I fear I may sound nonsensical to you."" ""No, Lady Willard,"" Poirot replied. ""I, too, believe in the power of superstition. It is a force to be reckoned with."" I was taken aback. I had never imagined Poirot to be superstitious. But he seemed genuinely concerned. ""You wish for me to protect your son? I will do everything in my power to keep him safe."" ""Yes, but what about protecting him from occult influences?"" ""In the ancient texts of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, there are methods to counteract black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we do now with all our modern knowledge. Now, let us focus on the facts so I may offer guidance. Your husband was a devoted Egyptologist, correct?"" ""Yes, he dedicated his life to it. He was a renowned expert in the field."" ""And Mr. Bleibner, was he just an amateur?"" ""Indeed, he was. A wealthy man who dabbled in various interests. My husband managed to pique his interest in Egyptology, and his finances supported the expedition."" ""What about the nephew? Was he part of the expedition?"" ""No, I never even knew he existed until I read about his death. I don't believe he and Mr. Bleibner were close. My husband never mentioned any family."" ""Who else was part of the expedition?"" ""There was Dr. Tosswill from the British Museum, Mr. Schneider from the Metropolitan Museum in New York, a young American secretary, Dr. Ames in a professional capacity, and Hassan, my husband's loyal servant."" ""Do you recall the name of the American secretary?"" ""I think it was Harper, but I can't be certain. He hadn't been with Mr. Bleibner for long. He was a pleasant young man."" ""Thank you, Lady Willard."" ""Is there anything else?"" ""Not for now. Leave it in my hands, and rest assured I will do all I can to protect your son."" His words were not entirely comforting, yet Lady Willard seemed relieved that her fears were taken seriously. I had never suspected Poirot of harboring such superstitions. I broached the topic as we made our way back. Poirot was serious. ""Indeed, Hastings. I believe in these matters. Superstition is a powerful force."" ""What is our plan then?"" ""Always practical, my dear Hastings! Well, first we shall cable New York for more details on young Mr. Bleibner's demise."" And so the journey began.",1
"""I asked Pagett what he was doing up so late. He claimed to be coding cables and updating the diary. Always the martyr, that one. When I pressed him further, he mentioned seeing a suspicious man coming down the passage from my cabin. Intrigued, I decided to follow the man as he slunk up the stairs by the saloon.""",1
"""The cigarette end would be enough, whether it matches or not. It's a South American cigarette wrapped in liquorice-scented paper,"" Poirot nodded. The commissary suggested, ""Perhaps the cigarette end and match were M. Renauld's. He did just come back from South America two years ago."" ""No,"" the other countered. ""I've checked through M. Renauld's belongings. His cigarettes and matches are distinctively different.""",1
"Seemingly lost in thought, his furrowed brow suggested deep concentration. I could sense his sharp mind beginning to take charge. The first words out of his mouth were unexpected. ""Do you happen to know, my dear friend, if Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim shared a bedroom?"" The inquiry was so out of place that we were momentarily speechless, exchanging puzzled looks before bursting into laughter at Poirot's seemingly trivial question.",1
"""Upon hearing his words, a weight seemed to lift from my heart. 'I believe many share your sentiments,' I declared. 'The evidence against him is remarkably scant. I am convinced of his acquittal, without a shadow of a doubt.' Stonor's reaction was not as positive as I had hoped. 'I wish I could share your certainty,' he replied solemnly. He then turned to Poirot. 'What is your take on this, Monsieur?' 'The situation appears rather grim,' Poirot responded calmly. 'Do you think he is guilty?' Stonor inquired sharply. 'No. But I fear he will struggle to prove his innocence.'""",1
"I decided to seek out the night stewardess for answers. Ringing the bell, a man eventually answered and provided me with the information I sought. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. When I inquired about the night stewardess, he informed me that there was no stewardess on duty after ten o’clock. It seemed my memory was playing tricks on me.",1
"“Six long years,” Sir Eustace lamented. “He must be quite indispensable to you,” Mrs. Blair remarked. “Oh, indispensable indeed. Yes, quite indispensable.” The poor man's tone grew even more despondent, as if Mr. Pagett's indispensability was a burden to him. Then he continued more energetically: “But his appearance should truly instill confidence in you, my dear lady. No respectable killer would ever choose to look suspicious. Crippen, for instance, was said to be exceedingly charming.” “Wasn’t he apprehended on a ship?” Mrs. Blair whispered. A noise caught our attention. I spun around swiftly.",1
"“But why?” he asked, puzzled. “Because uncertainty creates panic,” she replied.  “The Prime Minister's disappearance has caused chaos. Will he return? Is he alive? Until these questions are answered, panic will continue to spread like wildfire. The enemy thrives on this uncertainty.”",1
"""Poirot, this case of Renauld has truly been a puzzle that stumps even the keenest minds. Young investigators like Giraud, who disregard the importance of psychology, are bound to come up short."" ""You're truly remarkable, Poirot,"" I exclaimed, filled with admiration. ""Absolutely remarkable. Only someone as brilliant as you could have cracked this case!"" My words seemed to please him. For once, he appeared almost bashful. ""Ah, so now you don't look down on poor old Papa Poirot anymore? Have you shifted your loyalty away from the human bloodhound?"" His nickname for Giraud never failed to amuse me. ""Indeed.""",1
"“So there it was. Two possibilities emerged from Black’s story – did Mr. Maltravers contemplate a unique suicide method, or did his wife see an opportunity for murder? I leaned towards the latter. To shoot himself as described, he would have had to use his toe to pull the trigger, or something of the sort. If he had been found with one boot off, surely someone would have mentioned it. A detail like that would not have gone unnoticed. No, my inclination was towards murder rather than suicide, although I lacked any concrete evidence to support my hypothesis. Hence the elaborate charade you witnessed tonight.” “I’m still not entirely clear on the specifics of the crime,” I admitted. “Let’s go back to the beginning. Here we have a cunning and calculating woman who, aware of her husband’s financial troubles and tired of her older, wealthy spouse, persuades him to take out a hefty life insurance policy, and then sets about finding a way to achieve her goal. A stroke of luck presents itself in the form of the young soldier’s peculiar tale. The following afternoon, believing Monsieur le Capitaine to be at sea, she and her husband take a stroll around the estate. ‘That story from last night was quite intriguing,’ she remarks. ‘Could a man really shoot himself like that? Show me how it’s done!’ The gullible man obliges. He places the rifle in his mouth. She bends down, her finger on the trigger, looking up at him with a laugh. ‘And now, sir,’ she teases, ‘what if I were to pull the trigger?’ “And then, Hastings, she pulls it!” In the cases I have chronicled so far, Poirot’s investigations have typically begun with a central fact – be it murder or theft – and have unfolded through a series of logical deductions to a satisfying resolution. However, the events I am now recounting took a different path, with a chain of seemingly insignificant incidents catching Poirot’s attention and ultimately leading to a dark and intricate case.”",1
"""He tried to flee, but I caught him red-handed. He's in custody for killing his father, Mr. Paul Renauld."" Poirot turned to face the young man, who was slumped against the door, his complexion drained of color. ""What's your response to this, young man?"" Jack Renauld gazed back at him expressionless. ""No comment,"" he replied. I was shocked. I never truly thought Jack Renauld was capable of such a crime. I anticipated a strong denial of guilt when Poirot accused him.",1
"I gasped in horror as I saw the dagger, a chilling reminder of the past. Maître Grosíer interrupted, demanding to speak with his client before any more questions were answered. Jack Renauld, however, showed no mercy and dismissed him, stating calmly: ""Yes, I know this dagger. It was a gift to my mother from me, a keepsake from the war."" When asked about duplicates, Jack confidently replied: ""To my knowledge, there is no other like it. I designed the setting myself."" The magistrate was taken aback by the audacity of his response.",1
"A jumble of nerves, poor soul. I've done what I could to shield her from it all, though the shock was bound to be overwhelming."" ""You were treating Mr. Maltravers recently?"" ""My dear fellow, I never treated him."" ""What?"" ""I believe Mr. Maltravers followed the Christian Science faith or something along those lines."" ""But you conducted the examination?"" ""Indeed. I was summoned by one of the lower gardeners."" ""And the cause of death was evident?"" ""Completely. There was evidence of blood around the mouth, but the majority of the bleeding appeared to be internal."" ""Was he still in the same position as when he was discovered?"" ""Yes, the corpse had not been disturbed.""",1
"""Should I pretend not to recognize you?"" ""Mr. Poirot, I need your urgent help with a very important matter. I must insist on complete confidentiality."" ""You have my word as Hercule Poirot, I cannot say more,"" declared my companion dramatically. ""It involves the Prime Minister. We are facing a serious crisis."" ""We're in a difficult situation!"" added Mr. Dodge. ""Is the situation critical?"" I inquired. ""What situation?"" ""The gunshot wound."" ""Oh, that,"" scoffed Mr. Dodge. ""That's in the past."" ""As my associate mentioned,"" Lord Estair continued, ""that incident is resolved. Fortunately, it was unsuccessful.""",1
"Renauld let out a small chuckle and shook her head slightly. “Nothing as dramatic, I assure you, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also chuckled. “Indeed, we must avoid becoming too theatrical. There is something else,” he paused. Stonor interrupted eagerly: “They have a peculiar notion, Mrs. Renauld. They believe that Mr. Renauld was involved in a romance with a Madame Daubreuil who, supposedly, resides next door.” A deep blush appeared on Mrs. Renauld’s face. She lifted her head defiantly, then bit her lip, her expression trembling. Stonor gazed at her in disbelief, while M.",1
"""Mother,"" Jack cried as Renauld approached, but she pushed him away. ""I am not your mother! You are no son of mine! I disown you from this moment,"" she declared. Stunned, Jack called out again, hoping for a change of heart. But she stood firm, blaming him for his father's death. Poirot tried to intervene, but she remained resolute. ""You have caused your father's blood to be shed. You are responsible for his demise. Leave my home now,"" she commanded.",1
"We had just finished attending the Sunday concert, enjoying the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and relaxing with a Sunday nap after indulging in England le rosbif for dinner. These activities served as a distraction from Hercule Poirot's investigations. Poirot beckoned me to follow him as he entered the crude wooden structure. ""Are we planning to burglarize the flat?"" I inquired cautiously. Poirot's response did little to ease my concerns: ""Not exactly today,"" he stated. With a gentle tug on the rope, we descended gradually until we arrived at the second floor.",1
"I never imagined that my luck would run out, but it did the moment I crossed paths with the professional. From a young age, I delved into the world of crime, always one step ahead, carefully crafting my plans. I knew better than to execute them myself, leaving that to others. Despite my success, I couldn't escape the inevitable clash with someone like me, someone who lived and breathed for the thrill of the game. And now, as the tables turn, I find myself facing the consequences of underestimating the professional.",1
"""Indeed, quite the clever scheme,"" Poirot mused. As we rushed to the Magnificent in a taxi, I pondered the true depth of the plan. ""The 'full moon' concept was shrewd. The goal was to divert our attention to Friday, leaving us vulnerable before the heist. It's a shame you didn't catch on sooner,"" I remarked. Poirot, back to his usual self, shrugged off the oversight. ""One can't foresee everything,"" he said nonchalantly. The meeting at the Magnificent with Rolf and the Scotland Yard officials shed light on the audacious theft. The jewel-case had been taken, leaving behind only ""the Western Star."" The whole situation was surreal, leaving us all dumbfounded. Poirot suggested a visit to Madame, while Lord Yardly arrived at his door, visibly distressed. Poirot's clever ploy had unraveled the mystery, leading to the return of the stolen diamond. Lord Yardly, bewildered, could only watch as Poirot revealed the truth and bid him farewell. With a smile, Poirot shared a cryptic explanation with me, leaving me in awe of his brilliance.",1
"""Did a lawyer prepare the will?"" ""No, it was filled out on a pre-printed form and signed by the man and his wife who work for my uncle in the house."" ""Could this will be contested?"" ""I wouldn't dare to try."" ""So you see it as a game set by your uncle?"" ""That's precisely my perspective."" ""It does seem like a challenge,"" Poirot mused.",1
"I wrenched a dagger from his grasp, while Poirot unveiled his eyes with the scarf still concealing his mouth. I raised my gun, unmistakably signaling the futility of resistance. As he ceased to resist, Poirot leaned in close to whisper urgently in his ear. Within moments, the man nodded in agreement. Gesturing for silence, Poirot led the way out of the apartment and down the staircase. Our captive obediently followed, and I brought up the rear, gun in hand. Once outside, Poirot turned to me. ""A taxi is waiting just around the bend. Hand me the gun.""",1
"""Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that fateful evening? If he didn't see Mademoiselle Marthe, who did he see?"" ""Poirot, do you truly think a young man like him could kill his own father?"" ""My friend, you are too sentimental. I have witnessed mothers who murdered their own children for insurance money! After that, anything is possible."" ""And the reason?"" ""Money, as always. Jack Renauld believed he would inherit half his father's fortune upon his death."" ""But what about the vagrant.""",1
"""It appeared that Poirot was fixed on this very spot. ""What's the plan?"" I asked quietly. ""Just observe."" ""But..."" ""I anticipate nothing will occur for an hour, maybe two, but..."" Before he could finish, a piercing cry echoed: ""Help!"" A sudden light illuminated the second floor room to the right of the house. The cry originated from there. Simultaneously, a shadow of two figures in conflict appeared on the window shade. ""Good heavens!"" exclaimed Poirot.",1
"I rummaged until I discovered a dusty lipstick, applying it generously to my lips. Next, I darkened my under eyes with charcoal. Adding a crimson ribbon on my exposed shoulder, a scarlet feather in my hair, and a cigarette perched in the corner of my mouth, I admired the overall appearance. ""Anna the Adventuress,"" I declared, gazing at my image. ""Anna the Adventuress. Chapter One, 'The Mansion in Mayfair'!"" Women can be quite naive. In the following days, I found myself rather uninterested. Mrs.",1
"I had my pencil and notebook in hand. Despite the lack of noteworthy details, I sketched a brief outline of the room to mask my frustration. While placing the pencil back in my bag, it unexpectedly slipped and rolled across the uneven floor of the ancient Mill House. It gathered speed until finally stopping beneath a window. Each window had a wide window-seat, concealing a cupboard below.",1
"“Maybe these are the ones that went missing or maybe not” “Maybe what?” I avoided a direct response. “I am curious,” I remarked, “about the fate of the other guy. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We are starting to uncover some truths in this case. It seems like everyone is after the diamonds. 'The Man in the Brown Suit' must have murdered Nadina to get his hands on them.” “He didn’t murder her,” I interjected firmly. “Of course he did. Who else could it have been?” “I can’t say. But I know he is not the killer.” “He entered the house three minutes after her and left looking as pale as a ghost.” “Because he discovered her lifeless body.",1
"""As the doctor gave his opinion on the case, Jack Renauld lay in a fitful sleep, his face flushed and turning from side to side. Madame Daubreuil, with her enigmatic smile, assured us that he was resting. Poirot, always thorough, inquired about Stonor's whereabouts, but received no definitive answer. We left the villa and headed back towards town, with Poirot looking back at the lighted window where Marthe was still at work. 'He is being guarded at all events,' he muttered. At the hotel, we settled in for the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead in the morning.""",1
"He quickly disposes of her, then sets to work. Leaving the front door slightly open to suggest the assassins' exit, he ties up Madame Renauld, ensuring the bonds are secure this time. Donning an overcoat over his underclothes, he plans to discard it in the grave. After smoothing over the flower bed, he heads out the window, leaving incriminating evidence behind. Out on the desolate golf course, he digs, and then...justice catches up to him. Two crimes intertwined, the first solved by Poirot's brilliance. The deeper mystery, however, proves more challenging, with the criminal cleverly using M. Renauld's own devices. Poirot's deduction skills shine, outshining even the sharp Giraud. The truth behind the dark hair tangled in the dagger remains a mystery, but Poirot's astuteness prevails.",1
"""Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?"" ""That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, cellela!"" The old woman tossed her head scornfully. ""Madame Daubreuil,"" murmured the commissary. ""Impossible."" ""Voilà,"" grumbled Françoise. ""That is all you get for telling the truth."" ""Not at all,"" said the examining magistrate soothingly. ""We were surprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were "" he paused delicately. ""Eh? It was that without doubt?"" ""How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was milor anglais trés riche and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one and trés chic for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but ma foi! I who speak to you have seen the men's heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end."" And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. ""And Madame Renauld?"" he asked at length. ""How did she take this friendship."" Françoise shrugged her shoulders. ""She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!"" I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. ""You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?"" ""Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her."" ""What time was that?"" ""About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur."" ""Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?"" ""I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down."" ""And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?"" ""Nothing whatever, monsieur."" ""Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?"" ""I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open."" ""What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?"" ""Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere."" ""Good, Françoise, you can go."" The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. ""I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that."" And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. ""Léonie Oulard,"" called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. ""Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed."" But Denise had her own theory. ""Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!"" ""It is, of course, possible,"" said the magistrate smoothly. ""Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?"" ""Not last night, monsieur, the night before."" ""But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?"" ""No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil."" Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. ""Had you ever seen this lady before?"" ""Never, monsieur."" And then the girl added diffidently: ""But I think she was English."" ""English?"" ""Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n'est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English."" ""Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?"" ""Me, I speak the English very well,"" said Denise with pride. ""The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur's last words as he opened the door for her."" She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: ""'Yeas yeas butt for Gaud's saike go nauw!'"" ""Yes, yes, but for God's sake go now!"" repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil's visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, voilà tout! So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. ""You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly."" The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.""",1
"I glanced around the room, taking note of the various guests. Mrs. Blair was seated with the Captain, accompanied by Colonel Race. A distinguished grey-haired man sat on the other side of the Captain, catching my attention. Among the familiar faces on deck, there was one man who stood out. Tall and dark, his sinister countenance was impossible to miss. Intrigued, I inquired with the purser about his identity. ""That man? Oh, he's Sir Eustace Pedler's secretary. He's been quite ill from seasickness and has only just emerged.""",1
"The night had been filled with bizarre and inexplicable events. My questions went unanswered, as if they had never been heard. Frustrated, I threw myself onto the bed, succumbing to a bewildering and draining sleep. When I awoke, the sun was already streaming through the open windows, illuminating Poirot's tidy and cheerful figure by my bedside. ""Finally awake! You truly are a renowned sleeper, Hastings! Did you realize it's almost eleven o'clock?"" I groaned, rubbing my temples. ""I must have been lost in a dream,"" I muttered.",1
"The bonds were last seen in the London and Scottish Bank office on the morning of the 23rd. They were said to have reappeared in New York half an hour after the Olympia docked, or possibly even before. But what if they were never on the Olympia to begin with? There is another way they could have made it to New York - the Gigantic. Departing from Southampton on the same day as the Olympia, the Gigantic is known for its record-breaking Atlantic crossings. If the bonds were sent by the Gigantic, they would have arrived in New York a day before the Olympia did.",1
"Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on January 8th, a woman with a foreign accent visited Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, requesting information on properties near the Thames. She identified herself as Mrs. de Castina, but her true identity remained a mystery. The next day, her lifeless body was discovered in a house in Marlow. The investigation pointed towards a man in a brown suit as the prime suspect, leaving the police and media searching for answers.",1
"""His recovery has been slow,"" Mr. Shaw admitted, a hint of concern in his voice. ""This bronchitis has taken a toll on him, especially with the added stress of my absence and this new problem."" Poirot probed further, trying to assess the relationship between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour's responses were concise and formal. The nephew, a dependable Bank official, had no financial troubles or outstanding debts that he was aware of. Similar tasks had been assigned to him previously.",1
"""I made it my mission to uncover the truth. 'Italy has always been a dream of mine,' I confessed. 'Florence, in particular. How was your time there?' 'It was quite enjoyable, Miss Lancaster.

"Baker's wife mentioned that they had signed one document in the morning, just after she had put the milk on for cocoa at eleven.

"Dear Miss Beddingfeld,  I hope this letter finds you well. I felt compelled to reach out to you, not only for my own satisfaction in writing, but also for the joy I know it will bring you to receive correspondence from me. Our mutual acquaintance, Mr. Race, may have underestimated his own intelligence, don't you think? In light of recent events, I have decided to designate you as the executor of my literary estate. Enclosed you will find my personal diary. While it may not hold much interest for Race and his associates, I believe you may find certain passages quite entertaining. Feel free to use the contents as you see fit. Perhaps you could consider writing an article for the Daily Budget, titled ""Encounters with Criminals."" Naturally, I expect to be portrayed as the central character in your narrative.",1
"A handshake, then.” After Poirot's departure, I felt unsettled. Walking along the beach, I observed the bathers without the desire to join them. I imagined Cinderella might be among them in a stunning outfit, but she was nowhere to be seen. My aimless stroll led me towards the outskirts of town. I thought it would be the right thing to do to check on the girl. It would also prevent future complications.",1
"""You will handle the passage-money, while I will arrange for the passport. It appears as though you require the assistance of a second secretary,"" he declared firmly. Our eyes locked in a silent battle of wills. ""Understood,"" I replied weakly. ""Keep my presence by your side a secret."" ""Understood,"" I repeated. Despite my initial hesitation, I couldn't shake the feeling that having him by my side might be beneficial. However, a sense of impending trouble lingered. Just when I believed I had found tranquility! I halted my guest as he made to leave.",1
"Poirot entered the chaotic room with Mr. Opalsen pacing furiously and two police officials standing nearby. A terrified hotel chambermaid stood by the fire-place, while Mrs. Opalsen's French maid wept uncontrollably. The tears streaked Mrs. Opalsen's powdered face as Poirot, composed and grinning, made his presence known.",1

"To shoot himself as indicated, he must have used his toe to pull the trigger. Had Maltravers been discovered with one boot missing, it would have surely been reported.

Thus, the intricate charade you witnessed tonight."" ""I am still unclear on all the specifics of the crime,"" I admitted. ""Shall we begin from the start?""",1
"“Any updates?” I inquired, confident that I had identified all the crucial details. Poirot regarded me with a mix of pity and disappointment, gently shaking his head. “My poor friend! Alas, you lack the knack! The crucial detail eludes you every time!

Two weeks later, Mr. Bleibner succumbed to acute blood poisoning, followed shortly by his nephew's tragic suicide in New York City.",1
"""I can't say for sure."" He paused, his face turning red before speaking with sudden intensity: ""Why did I even say that? I truly did have love for my father. Despite the harsh words we exchanged during our last meeting, and the countless arguments about my reckless behavior and mounting debts, I held a deep affection for the man. It's only now, when it's all said and done,"" he added in a softer tone. ""It was during my time at Cambridge that I encountered the other chap."" ""Young Eardsley?"" ""Indeed, young Eardsley. His father, a well-known figure in South Africa. We instantly formed a bond, my dear friend and I.""",1
"“I recognize the name, but I can’t quite remember. What’s her profession?” “I’m not sure, but here is her picture.” Mr. Aarons examined it briefly, then his eyes lit up. “Ah ha!” He exclaimed. “The Dulcibella Kids, of course!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “Yes, they're siblings. Performers, skilled in acrobatics, dancing, and singing. Quite entertaining. They are currently touring the provinces, or possibly taking a break. They have been performing in Paris for the past few weeks.” “Could you please find out their exact location for me?” “No problem at all. Just head home, and I’ll provide you with the information in the morning.”",1
"Speaking through tears, she confessed to her child, her honor, and her reputation. She acknowledged her involvement with Georges Conneau, accepting moral responsibility but denying any further guilt. Despite her error in not reporting Conneau, she believed no woman could have done so.",1
"""I must say, your manners leave much to be desired,"" I stated icily. ""I'll spare you the burden of my company."" He made a move towards the exit, but staggered in the process. Reacting quickly, I guided him onto the couch. ""Don't act foolishly,"" I admonished. ""Do you really want to leave a trail of blood all over the vessel?"" He appeared to comprehend the logic behind my words, sitting still as I tended to his injury. ""There,"" I remarked, offering a pat on my handiwork, ""that should suffice for now.""",1
"Poirot and I arrived at Marsdon Manor and were greeted by a middle-aged parlourmaid who led us to a small morning-room. After a brief wait, a slender figure in widow's weeds appeared. Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit. Mrs. Maltravers, a beautiful woman in her late twenties, recounted the events of her husband's death. She had been changing for tea when her maid informed her that one of the gardeners had found something. Poirot sympathetically listened to her story and inquired about her husband's activities earlier that day. She mentioned that he had been shooting rooks, and Poirot asked to see the rook rifle. Mrs. Maltravers led us to the hall where the rifle was kept. Poirot observed that two shots had been fired before delicately requesting to see the rest of the house. A servant was called to guide him, leaving me alone with the lovely widow. I attempted to engage her in conversation, but her thoughts seemed elsewhere. When Poirot returned, he thanked Mrs. Maltravers for her cooperation and assured her that she need not worry further about the matter. As we walked back to London, Poirot mentioned a slight discrepancy he had noticed, hinting at the possibility of foul play. Just then, a tall young man approached us on the drive.",1
"""What proof do we have that Ascanio and his companion, or two individuals pretending to be them, actually visited the apartment that evening? No one witnessed their entry; no one saw them leave. Our evidence comes from a single individual and a multitude of lifeless objects."" ""Are you suggesting?"" ""I am suggesting that the cutlery, dishes, and empty plates speak volumes. It may have been a devious plan! Graves is no saint, but he certainly is meticulous! After overhearing snippets of the morning conversation, he understands that Ascanio will be vulnerable. The next night, around eight o'clock, he informs his employer that he has a phone call.""",1
"Lord Yardly anxiously paced back and forth in the elegant drawing room, his mind consumed with thoughts of debt and desperation. Monsieur Poirot sat calmly, observing the nobleman with keen eyes. ""You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?"" Lord Yardly nodded, acknowledging the weight of his decision. ""That's it,"" he admitted. ""It's been in the family for some generations, but it's not entailed. Still, it's not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser."" Poirot's mind whirred with possibilities as he considered the implications of this revelation. ""One more question,"" he inquired, turning his attention to Lady Yardly. ""Which plan does she approve?"" Lady Yardly's gaze was filled with concern as she voiced her strong opposition to selling the jewel. Poirot understood the delicate balance of power within the Yardly family and made a decision. ""You return to Yardly Chase at once? Bien! Say no word to anyone to anyone mind but expect us there this evening. We will arrive shortly after five."" Lord Yardly, though bewildered, complied with Poirot's instructions, leaving the room with a sense of hope and uncertainty. It was a race against time as Poirot and his companion arrived at Yardly Chase, greeted by a scene of familial warmth and tension. Lady Yardly's eyes widened in surprise, while Lord Yardly sought guidance from Poirot. With impeccable timing, Poirot seamlessly shifted the focus of the conversation to the investigation at hand, seeking crucial information from Lady Yardly. As the evening unfolded, the true motivations and secrets of the Yardly family began to surface, setting the stage for a thrilling conclusion.",1
"As our love was tested and proven, my parents eventually softened towards us, recognizing the depth of my feelings. I had not revealed to her my father's main concern about our relationship. Attempting to force the issue would only harm my case. Despite our disagreement, my father's letters from Paris were warm and loving, with no mention of our dispute. I responded in kind. ""Do you still have those letters?"" Giraud inquired. ""No, I did not keep them,"" I replied. ""It's not important,"" the detective said.",1
"I never fooled myself into thinking that had any real significance. It was likely just a passing fancy. Nevertheless, I had the ability to intrigue her. She was a woman who had gone through all the usual experiences in life. I intended to give her an exceptional one! And I admired her; admired her relaxed demeanor, her absence of sentimentality, her genuine nature. I was determined. I resolved to find her immediately. It was unlikely she would be asleep already. But then I realized I didn't have her cabin number.",1
"""I was determined to remain near the Falls, just in case he had taken you hostage nearby, but I was at a loss on what to do with the diamonds. I couldn't bear the thought of holding onto them,"" Suzanne nervously glanced around, her eyes darting as if searching for hidden threats. Leaning in close, she whispered urgently, ""It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm not so sure. What happened to the cases Sir Eustace took?""  ""The larger ones were shipped off to Cape Town. Pagett informed me before I departed the Falls, and he even included a receipt for their safekeeping.""",1
"In reality, the leader, often known as ‘the Colonel’, was believed to be of English descent, yet his true identity remained a mystery. Undoubtedly, he oversaw a vast network of criminals on a global scale. From robberies to espionage to assaults, he orchestrated it all while ensuring someone else took the fall. His cunning knew no bounds. This individual was rumored to be one of his operatives, but evidence was scarce. Indeed, Anne, we are making progress. Nadina seems to have ties to this illicit operation. The meeting scheduled for the morning of the 22nd was to take place in her quarters.",1
"""There are certain situations where a person might choose to wear pajamas and a trench coat, while the other would never do so!"" ""Agreed,"" I reluctantly admitted. ""No,"" Poirot interjected, ""we need to explore other avenues to unravel the mystery of the open door. I am quite certain that they did not exit through the door. They made their escape through the window."" ""What?"" ""Exactly."" ""But there were no footprints in the flowerbed below."" ""No, and there should have been. Listen carefully, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as he mentioned, had planted both flowerbeds the day before.""",1
"“But it's a relief that you never married the little doctor. He seems like the type who wouldn't appreciate having explosives in the house! So you're not going to contact Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “But you still think he's innocent?” “I believe that innocent people can still end up on the gallows.” “Hmm, yes. But, Anne, you need to accept the truth. Despite what you say, he might be the one who killed the woman.” “No,” I insisted. “He's not the one.” “That's just your emotions talking.” “No, it's not. He may have had a hand in her death.”",1
"""You can’t escape the truth that he made an attempt to push me off the boat, and all the pieces fall into place. Why do you persist in this new theory of yours?” “Because of his facial expression?” “His facial expression? But” “Yes, I understand your objection. It’s a menacing facial expression. That’s the point. No man with a face like that could truly be menacing. It must be a massive prank by Nature.” I wasn't fully swayed by Suzanne's reasoning. I have a good deal of knowledge about Nature in bygone eras. If she possesses a sense of humor, she doesn't reveal it often. Suzanne is exactly the type of individual who would project all of her own traits onto Nature. We moved on to our forthcoming plans.",1
"He resembles a medieval poisoner, the type of person the Borgias would enlist for their dirty work. I wouldn't be bothered if Pagett didn't involve me in his schemes. I prefer work to be light and playful, but Pagett is all seriousness. This is why living with him is a challenge. I suggested he visit Florence, a city he often spoke of with longing.",1
"I was a completely different person when I arrived back at the South Kensington square. Mrs. Flemming had a proposition for me, as Miss Emery was leaving. She asked if I would consider staying on with them, but I had already made plans to leave for South Africa. I assured her that I had already arranged everything and would be working as a parlourmaid upon arrival. Mrs. Flemming, though surprised, accepted my decision and even gave me a generous gift as a parting gesture. With twenty-five pounds in my pocket, I set off on my journey. After days of feeling unwell on the boat, I finally mustered the strength to go up on deck, looking forward to reaching Madeira. The purser tried to cheer me up, but I couldn't shake my hatred for him. ""We’ve had rather a nasty dusting in the Bay,"" he said, ""but there’s smooth weather ahead.""",1
"""She claimed the letters were destroyed? Ha, a woman never destroys a letter if she can help it! Not even if it would be the smarter choice!” “It’s easy for you to say,” I retorted, frustration bubbling up, “but you’ve completely embarrassed me! From start to finish! No, it’s one thing to try and justify it afterward. There’s a limit!” “But you seemed to be having such a good time, my dear friend. I couldn’t bring myself to burst your bubble.” “It’s pointless. You’ve crossed a line this time.” “My goodness! Why do you get so worked up over nothing, my friend?” “I’ve had enough!” I stormed out, slamming the door.",1
"""What is that?” “A mistake even a small mistake on the part of the killer.” He quickly walked to the adjacent kitchen, glanced inside, and frowned. “Sir,” he said to the owner, “please, clarify for me your meal service procedure.” The owner led him to a small opening in the wall. “This is the food elevator,” he described. “It connects to the kitchens on the upper floor. You place your order using this phone, and the dishes come down in the elevator, course by course. The used plates and utensils are sent back up the same way. No need to worry about household chores, you see, and yet you can avoid the constant attention of dining out in a restaurant.",1
"I hurried to get some water, leaving her behind. Luck was on my side as none of the servants were around. I managed to sneak a glass of water and added a splash of brandy from my flask. Returning to her side, I found her lying still. A few sips of the drink did wonders, reviving her quickly. ""Get me out of here, please, quickly!"" she pleaded, trembling. I supported her as we made our way outside, closing the door behind us. She took a deep breath of fresh air. ""Much better. That was awful! Why did you let me enter?"" Her reaction was so typically feminine that I couldn't help but smile.",1
"""Furthermore, there is additional evidence that, prior to his demise, he was engaged in a romantic affair with a French woman, Madame Daubreuil, who resides in the neighboring Villa. And to think, this is the same man who, as you claim, had no interest in women!"" The secretary's gaze sharpened. ""Wait a minute, Judge. You're on the wrong track. I was acquainted with Paul Renauld. What you're suggesting is simply not possible. There must be another explanation."" The judge raised his shoulders in a shrug. ""Then pray tell, what other explanation could there be?"" ""What makes you believe it was a romantic entanglement?"" ""Madame Daubreuil frequently visited him here during the evenings.""",1
"""Is it really necessary? I highly doubt Madame Renauld is working with Madame Daubreuil, for numerous reasons which I have already outlined. The rest should be quite obvious. With that possibility ruled out, we are getting closer to the truth, which, as always, is quite fascinating and intriguing."" ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""what else do you have up your sleeve?"" ""My dear friend, it is up to you to connect the dots. You have all the information at your disposal! Focus your mind. Don't think like Giraud, think like Hercule Poirot."" ""But can you be certain?"" ""Trust me, I have been quite foolish in many aspects.""",1
"She was standing there, her eyes cast down, a faint enigmatic smile on her lips. I couldn't shake the feeling of fear that crept over me, like one would feel in the presence of a dangerous snake. Poirot, ever polite, inquired about M. Stonor's whereabouts, but the answers provided little insight. As we made our way to the Villa Geneviève, a cry for help pierced the night, leading us to a harrowing discovery. With Cinderella's acrobatic skills, we narrowly averted a tragedy, uncovering the true identity of the murderer. The events of that night still haunt me, with Poirot's intense interrogation of Françoise etched in my memory.",1
"“I don’t know anything about him,” I quickly responded. “He showed up in London, took some valuable documents from me that have now caused me a lot of trouble, and then vanished into thin air in Cape Town. Yes, we were both at the Falls at the same time, but I was at the hotel while he was on an island. I can guarantee you that I never saw him once during my stay there.” I stopped to catch my breath. “You’ve got it all wrong. I was referring to your other secretary.” “What? Pagett?” I exclaimed, surprised.",1
"Alone in our isolated bubble, reminiscent of a modern-day Adam and Eve. Batani, our silent companion, observed like a loyal dog. Despite my injury, I insisted on taking charge of the cooking. Harry often ventured out, leaving us alone to pass the time under the palm trees, engaging in endless conversations and occasional arguments. Amidst the disputes, a genuine bond of camaraderie formed between us, unexpected and enduring. And yet, there was another element at play.",1
"On the rough wooden table before me lies the letter penned by Suzanne. ""Dear Babes in the Wood, Dear Lunatics in Love,"" it begins. Suzanne expresses her lack of surprise at the news of their impending disappearance and secret marriage. She scoffs at the idea of renouncing a vast fortune, deeming it absurd. Colonel Race, she mentions, initially wanted to argue the matter but has been convinced to leave it to time. He will oversee Harry's estate, she concludes.",1
"I found a note left for Miss Marvell by a mysterious stranger, warning her about a valuable diamond that must be returned to its rightful place. The letters were hand-delivered by a Chinaman, causing Miss Marvell great concern. She sought my advice and I recommended that she entrust the diamond to me until the upcoming full moon. Despite her initial reluctance, I urged her to consider the potential danger and safeguard the precious jewel with me.",1
"Renauld ascended the stairs; each step creaked loudly, as if trying to disturb the dead!” At the top of the staircase, a narrow hallway veered off. “The servants’ living quarters,” Bex clarified. We proceeded down a long corridor, and Françoise knocked on the final door to the right. A faint voice granted us permission to enter, and we stepped into a spacious, sunlit room with a view of the sparkling blue sea in the distance. A tall, striking woman was reclining on a couch, surrounded by cushions and under the care of Dr. Durand.",1
"""Miss Beddingfeld, you might be unaware, but you've entangled yourself in a dangerous affair."" ""I suspected as much,"" I replied. ""No, you don't. You couldn't possibly comprehend. I feel compelled to caution you. Walk away from this entirely. It's not your concern. Don't let your inquisitiveness tempt you to meddle in others' affairs. Please, don't become agitated. I'm not talking about myself. You have no clue what you're up against - these individuals will stop at nothing. They are utterly ruthless. You're already in peril, just consider last night. They suspect you know something. Your sole opportunity is to convince them they are wrong.""",1
"We made our way to Cape Town as soon as we could. Suzanne was there to welcome me, and together we dealt with the big giraffe. Colonel Race joined us in Muizenberg, suggesting we take up residence in the villa that once belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley. Plans were made for my return to London with Suzanne, including buying a trousseau in Paris. The future felt surreal, and at times suffocating. The night before we were to leave, Harry appeared, urging me to run away with him back to Rhodesia. Despite his persistence, I couldn't help but tease him about my French frocks. Harry's passion and determination were evident as he declared that I belonged to him. And so, without hesitation, I followed him, embracing the madness of it all. Two years later, we are still on the island, living out our own kind of happily ever after.",1
"We journeyed through the town of Amiens, a name that stirred up a flood of memories. A silent understanding passed between my companion and I. ""Thoughts of the War?"" he inquired. I nodded in response. ""You were a part of it, I assume?"" ""Indeed. I sustained an injury, and following the Somme, I was discharged entirely. I held a minor position in the Army for a short while. Currently, I serve as a private secretary to a Member of Parliament."" ""Impressive!"" he remarked. ""Not quite. My duties are minimal. A couple of hours each day suffices. It's rather monotonous, truth be told. I'm grateful to have a backup plan."" ""Do you have an unusual hobby?"" he teased. ""No, I share accommodations with a fascinating individual. A Belgian ex-detective who now operates as a private investigator in London. He's quite exceptional, often succeeding where the police have failed."" My companion's eyes widened with intrigue. ""How fascinating! I have a keen interest in crime. I frequently attend mystery movies and eagerly follow murder cases in the news."" ""Do you recall the Styles Case?"" I inquired. ""Wasn't that the poisoning of an elderly lady in Essex?"" I affirmed. ""That was Poirot's first major case. Without him, the culprit would have evaded capture. It was truly remarkable detective work."" Enthralled by my retelling, we were so engrossed that we only realized the train had arrived at Calais station. ""Goodness me!"" exclaimed my companion, reaching for her powder-puff. She proceeded to freshen up her makeup with a nonchalant air. ""Why go through all this effort?"" I asked tentatively. She paused, looking at me with surprise. ""It's necessary. All girls do it. I can't afford to look shabby,"" she explained. After a final glance in the mirror, she stowed away her beauty essentials in her bag. ""That's better. It may be a chore, but a girl must maintain appearances."" I had no response to her words of self-respect. Arriving at the platform, we bid farewell. ""I'll watch my language next time,"" she quipped. ""Allow me to accompany you on the boat,"" I offered. ""I may not be aboard. I need to ensure my sister made it on,"" she replied. ""But we will meet again, won't we?"" I inquired. We both shared a laugh.",1
"""Possibly,” conceded the other. “However, it would have been impossible to reach the tree without stepping on the flower-bed.” The commissary pointed out the lack of footprints due to the dry weather, except on the flower-bed where they would have been visible. Poirot inspected the smooth mould of the bed carefully, finding no indentations. Despite the commissary's belief that the footprints were insignificant, Poirot insisted they were the most important clue. They decided to investigate further, taking a path that led to a clearing with a view of the sea. In the distance, they saw a golf course under construction where a body had been discovered earlier. The commissary was annoyed that unauthorized personnel had accessed the scene. Just then, the famous detective M. Giraud appeared on the scene, eager to solve the case before darkness fell. Despite initial hostility towards Poirot, Giraud acknowledged the similarities in crime-solving methods over the years. As they discussed the footprints and the grave, Poirot seemed to have a subtle insight into the case, leaving Giraud intrigued.",1
"I was the first to fall ill, followed by Poirot. He now sat in bed, propped up with pillows and wrapped in a shawl, sipping a noxious tisane. He gazed at the row of medicine bottles on the mantelpiece with satisfaction. ""Yes, yes,"" he said. ""I will soon be the great Hercule Poirot again, the terror of wrongdoers! Imagine, my friend, I have a mention in Society Gossip.""",1
"""You proceed with your tasks,"" he ordered. The chambermaid hesitated before reluctantly complying. ""Are you going to frisk her?"" she questioned, nodding towards Célestine. ""Indeed,"" he confirmed, before dismissing the chambermaid and locking the door. Célestine followed the inspector into the cramped space. Upon her return a short while later, it was evident that nothing incriminating had been discovered. The inspector's expression darkened. ""Regrettably, I must insist that you accompany me, miss,"" he stated. Addressing Mrs. Opalsen, he added, ""I apologize, madam, but the evidence is compelling. If the items are not in her possession, they must be concealed somewhere in this room.""",1
"""Will you question me again, miss?"" ""What are you implying?"" ""If you were to inquire again, my answer would change. Someone is under suspicion, but not a Chilean."" ""Who?"" The question barely escaped her lips. ""M. Jack Renauld."" ""What?"" Her voice rose in disbelief. ""Jack? That can't be. Who would dare accuse him?"" ""Giraud."" ""Giraud!"" Her complexion turned pale. ""I fear that man. He's ruthless. He will he will "" She hesitated. But then, a look of determination filled her face. I saw then that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, observed her closely.",1
"This information is kept in a large safe, with two keys held by different individuals and the combination known by a third person. The keys are given to the Bank, which then sends them to England. Each parcel is valued at approximately £100,000. The Bank became suspicious when they noticed something unusual about the way the package was sealed. Upon opening it, they discovered sugar cubes inside! John Eardsley became the primary suspect, possibly due to his reckless behavior at Cambridge and his father bailing him out of debts. Rumors began to circulate that the tale of the South American diamond fields was nothing but a fabrication.",1
"""The Prime Minister’s car failed to arrive home following the drop-off at Charing Cross. O’Murphy was sought after by the police, prompting an immediate search. The vehicle was located outside a notorious restaurant in Soho, recognized as a hub for German agents. The chauffeur was also missing, adding to the mystery. With the Prime Minister vanished in France and O’Murphy gone in London, there are now two puzzling disappearances to unravel.""",1
"""Madame Daubreuil!"" I gasped. Poirot corrected me with a smile. ""That is not her true name, my friend. Back then, she went by the infamous Madame Beroldy!"" Madame Beroldy! Suddenly, memories flooded back. The sensational murder trial that captivated the globe. The Beroldy Case. About two decades prior, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, from Lyons, came to Paris with his beautiful wife and their young daughter, just a baby.",1
"""Pausing momentarily, she repeated with great effort: “'Yes, yes, but for heaven's sake go now!'” The magistrate echoed her words, then sent Denise away and called back Françoise. He questioned whether she had erred in identifying the night of Madame Daubreuil's visit. Despite his doubts, Françoise remained steadfast in her assertion that it was indeed the previous night when Madame Daubreuil had appeared. Denise's attempts to intrigue were futile; she had fabricated a story about a mysterious woman.""",1
"Poirot requested some preliminary information and admired the organization of Mr. Marsh's office. The neatly docketed packets of papers and labeled keys impressed him, as did the precise arrangement of the china cabinet. However, his satisfaction was interrupted when he noticed a dirty envelope attached to the key of the desk.",1
"""Approach us,"" he whispered, ""You have knowledge of dark forces. The young master must leave. Evil surrounds us."" Without waiting for a response, he departed abruptly. Poirot muttered about feeling the evil in the air as our meal continued somberly. Dr. Tosswill monopolized the conversation with talk of Egyptian artifacts. As we prepared for bed, Sir Guy pointed out a shadowy figure among the tents. It was Anubis, the jackal-headed god. Despite Dr. Tosswill's skepticism, Poirot identified the figure entering Dr. Ames's tent. They searched in vain for the mysterious presence, while Poirot protected our tent with diagrams and symbols. Dr. Tosswill dismissed Poirot's actions as nonsense. Poirot, however, confidently declared that we could now rest peacefully. As Hassan brought him chamomile tea, Poirot expressed relief at the prospect of sleep. I marveled at the desert landscape before retiring for the night.",1
""" He fell silent, deep in thought, before continuing: ""How is it that the staff heard nothing? Were they somehow incapacitated? Could there have been an accomplice ensuring the front door was left open? It makes one wonder..."" His words trailed off as we approached the house's driveway. Abruptly, he spun towards me. ""My dear friend, prepare to be amazed! Your critiques have not gone unnoticed! Today, we shall investigate some footprints!"" ""Where?"" I inquired. ""Over in that flower bed to the right. According to M. Bex, they belong to the gardener. Let us verify that claim, shall we.""",1
"Suzanne's enthusiasm was lacking, having traveled extensively. She was not one to get excited before breakfast. When I expressed excitement at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus, she snubbed me sharply. Let me clarify, this story will not be set in South Africa. I won't be offering any authentic local color, with words in italics on every page. While I admire it, I simply cannot replicate it. In the South Sea Islands, however, bêche-de-mer is always a point of immediate reference.",1
"No trace of her throughout the day, my anxiety escalating by the hour. The evening brought a newspaper with shocking headlines. ""It was horrifying! Though not confirmed, my fear for Bella grew.

""Absolutely, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely!"" He fixed a severe gaze upon me. ""No, Anne, a thousand times no. You are not understanding what you are suggesting.""   ""I am. It resolves everything.""  ""I could never face Race again. I'll take my chances, but I refuse to allow this cunning old man to escape. It's not an option, Anne. I cannot do it.""   Sir Eustace laughed softly. He acknowledged his defeat without showing any emotion. ""Ah, well,"" he commented.",1
"""He persisted: “The risk he took to acquire that dagger was substantial. Maybe he was concerned about leaving fingerprints on it.” Bex was questioned by Poirot. “You mentioned there were none?” Giraud shrugged. “He might have been uncertain.” Poirot stared at him. “You are mistaken, M. Giraud. The murderer wore gloves. Therefore, he must have been certain.” “I am not suggesting it was the murderer himself. It could have been an accomplice who was unaware.” “The accomplices are ill-informed!” Poirot muttered, but said nothing more. The clerk for the judge was collecting the documents from the desk.""",1
"The nephew, overwhelmed with despair over the news, took his own life. Mr. Bleibner, who had no will, left his fortune to his nephew, and then to the doctor. Mr. Schneider's fate remains uncertain, as he may have suspected foul play. Poirot reveals that murderers often feel compelled to repeat their crimes. Young Bleibner had jokingly left everything to his friend in a will, which was kept secret. Poirot suggests a change of scenery, and they head to Brighton for the weekend. At the Grand Metropolitan, they encounter Mrs. Opalsen, known for her love of jewels. She excitedly shows off her pearl necklace to Poirot, much to his delight. Opalsen's husband mentions the financial strain in the City, hinting at potential troubles ahead.",1
"I had a feeling of unease whenever I was around Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who could make me feel self-conscious. As I searched through my cabin for a ribbon or motor-veil to tame my unruly hair, I noticed that someone had been rifling through my belongings. Drawers were left in disarray, items scattered around. It seemed as though a hasty search had been conducted. Puzzled, I wondered who had been in my cabin and what they were looking for. Could it be the mysterious half-sheet of paper with scribbled notes? I dismissed the idea. There must be something else. The events of the previous night had only added to the confusion. Who was the young man that had entered my cabin so unexpectedly? And who had stabbed him? And why? Cabin No. 17 held a key to this puzzle, but the pieces were still missing. As I made my list of suspects, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something sinister was happening aboard the Kilmorden Castle. My search led me to Sir Eustace Pedler, Mr. Pagett, and the Rev. Edward Chichester. Each one had their own reasons to be under my watchful eye. With determination, I approached Mr. Chichester on deck, hoping to unravel the mystery surrounding Cabin 17.",1
"Poirot and I were sitting in his rooms one evening, discussing cases of interest. I had been given a recruiting job after being invalided out of the Army, so it had become routine for me to visit Poirot after dinner. It was during a time when ""Peace by negotiation"" was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies, but now that the need for secrecy has passed, I feel it is only fair for England to know the debt owed to my clever little friend, whose remarkable brain averted a great catastrophe.",1
"I couldn't risk escaping through the hall door, so I cautiously made my way to the attic. Huddled among my bindings, I laid on the cold floor, hoping to avoid detection. Despite my fears, no one came to investigate. After what seemed like an eternity, I ventured back downstairs, only to find the Kafir sentinel alert and humming. Desperate to flee, I struggled to devise a plan. Ultimately, I was compelled to retreat to the attic once more, resigned to the fact that the Kafir was vigilantly watching. I bided my time as the house stirred with the commotion of early morning activities.",1
"As I recalled Poirot's peculiar fixation on the footprints in the garden, I closely observed him while he testified. It seemed to me that he was either innocent of any involvement in the crime, or he was an exceptional actor. Just as he was leaving, a sudden thought occurred to me. ""Excuse me, Mr. Hautet,"" I interjected, ""may I pose a question to him?"" ""Of course, sir."" With that assurance, I directed my inquiry to Auguste. ""Where do you store your shoes?"" ""In a bag!"" snapped the elderly man. ""On my feet. Where else?"" ""And at bedtime?"" ""Beneath my bed."" ""And who polishes them?"" ""No one.""",1
"This morning, a telegram arrived in my hands. The message was urgent: ""Uncle Harrington was murdered last night. Please come as soon as possible. Bring a skilled detective with you, but most importantly, come yourself. -Zoe"" As we made our way to Elmer's Dale, the anticipation grew. The little station was a mere stop on our journey to the small grey stone building in the rugged moors. It was a desolate place, sending shivers down my spine. Havering, my companion, shared my sentiment. ""I must find a way to forget this place. I can never return here.""",1
"I observed a small, slender individual, complete with a beard, fixated on me with an intensity that suggested he saw a specter before him. His intensity piqued my interest, prompting me to investigate further. After some inquiries at the hotel, I discovered his identity as Carton, a diamond-sorter from Kimberley in the employ of De Beers. Overwhelmed by a flood of past injustices, I departed for Kimberley, determined to uncover more about him. Despite my efforts, details remained sparse. Ultimately, I resolved to confront him directly, arming myself with a revolver for the meeting.",1
"During our recent talk, he assigned 'Dinner' to my 'Tuesday,' however 'Journey' and 'Country' were met with 'Ship' and 'Uganda,' indicating his focus on his travels abroad rather than the local one. Mentioning 'Story' triggers a memory of a 'Lion' tale he shared over dinner. I mention 'Rook Rifle' and he responds with 'Farm,' a surprising choice. Bringing up 'Shot' elicits an immediate 'Suicide' from him, hinting at a tragic event involving a rook rifle on a farm.",1
"I doubted the killers would hide there, considering they could simply walk away. Returning to the dining area, Poirot was absent during our search. Focused on the round mahogany table, he examined it closely. Admiring the polished wood, a bowl of roses adorned the center, while lace mats decorated the surface. Despite a dish of fruit, the dessert plates were untouched. Three coffee cups remained, two stained black and one with milk remnants.",1
"I overheard Miss Pettigrew reading aloud to him, her voice droning on about ""the problem of colored labor."" He interrupted her with a grunt of frustration before I quietly moved on. Colonel Race was nowhere to be found in his room or the lounge, the one man I dreaded encountering. Without a moment to spare, I left the hotel and made my way to the bridge. Standing in the shadows, I kept watch for anyone who might have followed me across.",1
"""An intense anger clouded Giraud's expression, taking a step forward before being interrupted by Marchaud’s announcement. A tall, athletic man with a bronzed face and neck entered the room, instantly commanding attention. Gabriel Stonor's presence made even Giraud appear pale in comparison. As I got to know him, it became clear that Stonor was a truly remarkable individual.""",1
"The mind of man is a curious thing. A man's lack of originality can be his downfall, both in lawful and unlawful acts. Take, for example, the English murderer who followed the same pattern in disposing of his wives, leading to his ultimate capture. Originality could have saved him, but instead, he fell victim to his own predictable nature. The key, my dear Giraud, lies in the similarities between two crimes - a sign of the same mind at work. And that, my friend, is the clue we seek. The watch gaining two hours, the absence of footprints in the flower-bed, these are the details that reveal the truth. Remember, it is not just about cigarettes and match ends, but about understanding the mind behind the crimes.",1
"Poirot and I entered the tent, greeted by Hassan holding a cup of camomile tea. Poirot, with aching head, gladly accepted the steaming beverage. ""Finally, some peace,"" he sighed. ""I could use some rest."" I reassured the anxious expert, noting his confusion between Middle Ages superstitions and Ancient Egyptian beliefs.",1
"“Make sure Giraud stays in the dark. He thinks I’m insignificant, but he’ll regret it. Gave him a clue out of decency, if he ignores it, that’s on him.” I promised Poirot my silence. “Good! Now, let's use our brains. When do you think the crime occurred?” “Around two o’clock,” I replied, taken aback. “Mrs. Renauld heard the clock chime when the men were present.”",1
"We made it to shore without incident, thanks to my prayers. The journey to Livingstone would be tough, especially with wet clothes. My soaked skirts clung to my legs, and thorns ripped my stockings. Exhausted, I had to stop. Harry, my savior, offered to carry me for a while. And so, I entered Livingstone draped over his shoulder, wondering how he managed to bear the weight for the entire journey.",1
"She gazed at me, laughed lightly and remarked: “Anne, you truly are an extraordinary girl. Have you ever experienced any misgivings?” “Misgivings?” I inquired, confused. “Yes, misgivings, misgivings, misgivings! Setting off alone with hardly any money. What will you do when you find yourself in a foreign land with no money left?” “There’s no point in worrying about that until it happens. I still have plenty of money. The twenty-five pounds from Mrs. Flemming is still intact, and I won in the sweepstakes yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. I have quite a bit of money. Forty pounds!” “A lot of money! Goodness!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I consider myself brave in my own way. I couldn’t start off cheerfully with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea of what I was doing or where I was going.” “But that’s the thrill of it,” I exclaimed, feeling stirred. “It gives one such a wonderful sense of adventure.” She glanced at me, nodded a few times, and then grinned. “Lucky Anne! Not many people in the world share your feelings.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of this, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most exciting thing I’ve ever heard! Now, let’s get to the point. You mentioned in Sir Eustace’s secretary, not that solemn Pagett, the other one you identified the man who was stabbed and sought refuge in your cabin?” I nodded. “That gives us two connections linking Sir Eustace to this mess. The woman was killed in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t all be a coincidence. There must be a link somewhere, even if he's unaware of it.” ""Then there’s the strange case of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What did she look like?” “I barely noticed her. I was so excited and a stewardess seemed so inconsequential. But yes, her face did seem familiar. It could be because I saw her around the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” Suzanne said. “Are you sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was quite tall,” I admitted. “Hmm. Unlikely to be Sir Eustace, I’d say, nor Mr. Pagett. Wait!” She grabbed a piece of paper and started drawing rapidly. She examined the result with her head tilted to one side. “A striking resemblance to the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now onto the etceteras.” She handed me the paper. “Is this your stewardess?” “Yes,” I exclaimed. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She dismissed the compliment with a casual gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions about that Chichester character. Do you recall how he dropped his coffee cup and turned pale when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all mean? What was supposed to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. Timing that for a specific hour on a specific day in a specific place would serve no purpose. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they stabbed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both fell silent for a moment, then Suzanne took a different approach. “Could there have been something hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more plausible,” I agreed. “It would explain why my things were ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m certain of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I would have noticed.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were searching for?” “It’s a possibility, but it seems rather pointless. It was only a time and a date, and both had already passed.” Suzanne nodded. “That makes sense. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, do you have it with you? I’d like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it to her. She examined it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but” Suddenly she stood up and scrutinized the paper under the light. There was a suppressed excitement in her demeanor. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! It’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, do you see? So you must ignore it, and just go by the spaces the spaces!” I stood beside her. I read out the figures as I now perceived them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not exactly. It’s still one o’clock, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stared at each other, elated with our new discovery and so immersed in excitement that one might think we had solved the entire mystery. Then I came back to reality with a jolt. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her expression mirrored my disappointment. “No, it didn’t.” Another thought struck me. “This isn’t your original cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you initially booked?” “No, the purser reassigned me to it.” “I wonder if it was reserved before departure for someone who didn’t show up. We could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” exclaimed Suzanne. “I know! The purser told me about it. The cabin was reserved in the name of Mrs. Grey but it turns out that Mrs. Grey was actually a pseudonym for the renowned Madame Nadina. She’s a famous Russian dancer. She’s never performed in London, but Paris has been captivated by her. She had a tremendous success there during the War. A rather questionable character, I hear, but very charming. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board very sincerely when he assigned me her cabin, and then Colonel Race informed me a lot more about her. It seems there were some strange rumors circulating in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they had no evidence. I believe Colonel Race was there solely for that reason. He’s divulged some fascinating details to me. There was a well-organized group, not of German origin at all. In fact, the leader, often referred to as ‘the Colonel,’ was believed to be English, but they never uncovered his identity. However, he clearly controlled a significant network of international criminals. Robberies, espionage, assaults, he orchestrated them all and usually pinned the blame on an innocent scapegoat. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was rumored to be one of his operatives, but they couldn’t find anything concrete. Yes, Anne, we're on the right track. Nadina is exactly the type to be involved in this scheme. The meeting on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she embark?” A realization dawned on me. “She intended to set sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered in Marlow!” My thoughts drifted back to the empty room in the desolate house, and once again I felt that ominous sense of danger and malevolence. Along with it came the recollection of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent chord. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly, I dashed towards her and nearly shook her in my excitement. “Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would anyone return them to you like that in the middle of the night? It’s an absurd idea. No, they were a message, the films had been removed from the yellow tin case, and something else placed inside. Do you still have it?” “I might have used it. Oh, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She handed it to me. It was a standard round tin cylinder, typically used for films in tropical environments. I took it with trembling hands, but as I did so, my heart skipped a beat. It felt heavier than it should have been. With quivering fingers, I peeled off the strip of adhesive tape that sealed it shut. I removed the lid, and a cascade of dull, glassy stones spilled onto the bed. “Stones,” I said, feeling disappointed. “Stones?” exclaimed Suzanne. The excitement in her voice spurred me on. “Stones? No, Anne, not stones! Diamonds!” Diamonds! I stared, captivated, at the glimmering pile on the bunk. I picked up one that, despite its weight, resembled a shard of a broken bottle. “Are you certain, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear. I’ve seen raw diamonds too many times to have any doubts. They’re exquisite, Anne, and some of them are truly unique, I would say. There’s a story behind these.” “The story we heard tonight,” I exclaimed. “You mean?” “Colonel Race's account. It can’t be a coincidence. He recounted it for a reason.” “To observe its impact, you think?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But even as I said it, a doubt crept in. Was it Sir Eustace who was being tested, or was the story told for my benefit? I recalled the feeling of being deliberately interrogated on a previous night. Colonel Race was suspicious for some reason. But how did he fit into the puzzle? What was his connection to this affair? “Who is Colonel Race?” I inquired. “That’s a bit of a mystery,” Suzanne remarked. “He’s known for big-game hunting, and, as you heard him say tonight, he was a distant relative of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I never met him until this voyage. He travels to and from Africa quite often. There's a notion that he does work for the Secret Service. I’m not sure if it’s true. He’s quite an enigmatic figure.” “He must have inherited a substantial sum from Sir Laurence Eardsley?” “My dear Anne, he must be quite wealthy. You know, he’d be a perfect match for you.” “I can’t pursue him with you on board the ship,” I joked. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have an advantage,” Suzanne said smugly. “And everyone knows that I am entirely devoted to my husband, Clarence, you know. It’s so secure and pleasant to be involved with a loyal wife.” “It must be lovely for Clarence to be married to someone like you.” “Well, I’m tolerable to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he adjusts his eyeglass and dozes off in a large armchair. We could cable him to ask about Colonel Race. I love sending cables. And they irritate Clarence so. He always says a letter would suffice. I doubt he’d share much, though. He’s incredibly discreet. That’s what makes him so challenging to live with for extended periods. But let’s continue with our matchmaking. I’m certain Colonel Race is quite taken with you, Anne. Just give him a couple of glances with those mischievous eyes of yours, and it’s a done deal. Everyone gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I’m not looking to get married.” “Are you not?” Suzanne asked. “Why not? I adore being married, even to Clarence!” I disregarded her lightheartedness. “What I want to know is,” I said firmly, “what is Colonel Race's involvement in this? He’s part of it somehow.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, him sharing that story?” “No, I don’t,” I stated decisively. “He was observing us all closely. Some of the diamonds were recovered, not all. Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I didn’t respond directly. “I’d like to know,” I said, “what happened to the other young man. Not Eardsley, but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re shedding some light on the situation, at least. It's the diamonds that all these people are after. It must have been to acquire the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ murdered Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I interjected. “Of course he did. Who else could have?” “I’m not sure. But I believe he didn’t kill her.” “He entered that house three minutes after her and emerged as pale as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.” “But no one else entered.” “Then the murderer was already in the house, or found another way in. He didn’t need to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? In any case, he was the same as the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had the time to remove his disguise and follow the woman to Marlow. She and Carton were meant to meet there, they both had a viewing appointment for the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting seem accidental, they must have suspected they were being followed. Nonetheless, Carton didn’t realize that his shadow was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his composure completely and stepped back onto the line. It all seems quite clear, don’t you think, Anne?” I remained silent. “Yes, that’s how it happened. He took the paper from the deceased man, and in his haste to escape, he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow. What did he do after he left there, after he killed her or, as you believe, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still, I said nothing. “I wonder,” Suzanne said thoughtfully. “Is it possible that he persuaded Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be an excellent chance to leave England safely and evade capture. But how did he persuade Sir Eustace? It seems like he had some leverage over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested involuntarily. “You don’t seem to have a liking for Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace claims he’s a diligent and skilled young man. And, in truth, he may be in his favor. Well, to continue my speculations. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He read the paper he dropped. Consequently, misled by the dot like you were, he tried to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, after previously attempting to secure the cabin through Pagett. On the way there, someone attacked him” “Who?” I interrupted. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits. Cable Lord Nasby that you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and you’re set for life, Anne!” “There are a few things you've overlooked.” “What things? Rayburn has a scar, I know, but a scar can be easily falsified.”",1
"""Poirot chuckled. 'A joke! For the valet's benefit, of course. The card was designed for fingerprints. I went to Scotland Yard, found Inspector Japp, and presented the evidence. As expected, the fingerprints belonged to two notorious jewel thieves. Japp came with me, the thieves were apprehended, and the necklace was recovered from the valet. Clever criminals, but lacking in method. Haven't I told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, the importance of method?' 'More like thirty-six thousand times!' I interjected. 'But where did their plan go wrong?' 'My friend, it is a good idea to pose as a chambermaid or valet, but one must not neglect their duties. They left a room undusted, which revealed a square mark when the jewel-case was placed on the table near the door,' Poirot explained. 'I remember now,' I exclaimed. 'I was uncertain before, but now it all makes sense!' Mrs. Opalsen chimed in, 'And I have my pearls back.' 'Well,' I said, 'I suppose I should have some dinner.' Poirot joined me. 'This should earn you some praise,' I remarked. 'Not at all,' Poirot replied calmly. 'Japp and the local inspector will share the credit. However,' he patted his pocket, 'I have a check from Mr. Opalsen. What do you say, my friend? This weekend did not go as planned. Shall we return next weekend, my treat?' Now that the troubles of war are behind us, I can finally reveal the pivotal role Poirot played in a national crisis. The secret has been kept safe, away from the press. But now that the need for secrecy has passed, it's time England knows the debt it owes to my peculiar friend, whose brilliant mind prevented a disaster. One evening, after dinner, without specifying the date, when 'Peace by negotiation' was the enemy's mantra, Poirot and I were in his rooms. After leaving the Army due to injury, I had taken on a recruiting role, and it had become routine to visit Poirot in the evenings to discuss any intriguing cases he was working on. On this particular night, we delved into the news of the attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England's Prime Minister. The papers had been vague, only mentioning that the Prime Minister narrowly escaped the bullet. I was convinced that our law enforcement had been grossly negligent for such an incident to occur.""",1
"""I have my suspicions, but Sir Eustace is not directly involved. There must be some connection, even if he is oblivious to it,"" Suzanne pondered aloud. ""And then there's the strange case of the stewardess,"" she added, deep in thought. ""What do you remember about her?"" ""Honestly, I barely paid attention to her. I was too caught up in my own thoughts and a stewardess seemed insignificant at the time. Although, her face did strike me as familiar. Perhaps I had seen her around the ship,"" I replied. ""You found her face familiar?"" Suzanne questioned. ""Are you certain she wasn't a man?"" ""She was quite tall,"" I confessed. ""Hmm. I doubt it was Sir Eustace or Mr. Pagett. Just a moment!"" Suzanne exclaimed, grabbing a piece of paper and hastily sketching something.",1
"The outlandish and entirely baseless claims gained widespread acceptance, despite lacking any evidence. The prosecution remained relentless, refuting the existence of the mysterious ""Russians"" and instead pointing the finger at Madame Beroldy and her partner, Georges Conneau, for the crime. While a warrant was issued for Conneau's arrest, he had astutely vanished. It was revealed that the restraints holding Madame Beroldy were slack enough for her to escape at will.",1
"The victim of the Marlow murder was unknown to London audiences due to blurred pictures in the papers. On the other hand, Nadina had kept her visit to England a secret. After the murder, a letter was sent by her manager claiming she was returning to Russia. A cable sent from De Aar to the Daily Budget led to a sensational article. The murder was wrongly attributed to Harry Rayburn. The group traveled to Bulawayo, where Sir Eustace's bad temper caused tension. Miss Pettigrew avoided interaction, and the expedition to Matoppos was disrupted. Colonel Race and Anne drove off alone, surrounded by silence in the African landscape, contemplating primitive eras. Anne observed that Africa made one cruel, but Colonel Race disagreed, emphasizing the importance of not being cruel to weak beings.",1
"He chuckled mockingly before saying, ""I'm taking a chance that he won't speak."" When asked why, he explained, ""Because he likes playing a lone hand. And when the police catch me, I'll be of no further use to him. Free, perhaps! Well, time will tell."" He laughed, showing his confidence in his gamble with Fate. ""In any case,"" he added casually, ""I doubt we'll cross paths again."" ""No,"" I replied slowly. ""I don't think so."" ""Farewell."" ""Goodbye."" With a firm handshake and a piercing gaze, he abruptly departed, his footsteps fading away on the deck. The sound lingered, a reminder of his presence leaving my life. I must admit, the following two hours were far from enjoyable. Only after completing the tedious bureaucratic procedures on the wharf did I finally feel a sense of relief. No arrests had been made, the day was glorious, and hunger gnawed at me. Joining Suzanne, I headed to the hotel where we would spend the night. The boat to Port Elizabeth and Durban awaited us the next morning. The taxi ride to Mount Nelson was delightful, immersed in the heavenly sun, fresh air, and vibrant flowers. While I reveled in the beauty, Suzanne remained reserved, unimpressed by my enthusiasm. It is important to note that this tale will not delve into the intricacies of South Africa. I offer no authentic local details, no italicized words sprinkled throughout. The story of bêche-de-mer and stoeps will not be found here. I had a pawpaw for breakfast, mistaking it for a spoiled melon. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, suggesting lemon juice and sugar. I was thrilled to encounter a pawpaw, a far cry from the dreary English weather.",1
"Poirot received a desperate plea for help from Marthe Daubreuil. Without hesitation, he rushed to her aid, accompanied by a trusted companion. The Villa Marguerite loomed before them, a haven of secrets and sorrow. Marthe's eyes brimmed with tears as she poured out her heart, fearing for the safety of Jack. Time was of the essence as they delved into the twisted web of lies and deception that threatened to consume them all.",1
"""I am more than willing to showcase my techniques for you."" ""Please, go ahead and give us a demonstration!"" Poirot sat up straight, wagging his finger to emphasize his points. ""Let's begin with the fundamental fact of Georges Conneau. The story presented by Madame Beroldy in court regarding the 'Russians' was clearly a fabrication. If she was not involved in the crime, then she concocted the story on her own. However, if she was guilty, it could have been created by either her or Georges Conneau. In our current investigation, we encounter a similar narrative.""",1
"""Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “Mon ami, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to the facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason not like Giraud but like Hercule Poirot.” “But are you sure?” “My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile. But at last I see clearly.” “You know everything?” “I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.” “And you know the murderer?” “I know one murderer.” “What do you mean?” “We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but two. The first I have solved, the second eh bien, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was omniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.” “You don’t think ” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too horrible!” Poirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants there was, with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one man Jack Renauld. And a man must have dug a grave.… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad. “That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac.",1
"I couldn't fathom why a co-conspirator would choose to represent thirteen in such an obscure manner in reality. If he intended to convey thirteen, he would simply write ""13"". The separation between the one and the two was conspicuous. Consequently, I deducted twenty-two from one hundred and seventy-one. The outcome was one hundred and fifty-nine. After a second attempt, I reached one hundred and forty-nine. While these mathematical calculations served as good mental exercise, they proved fruitless in unraveling the enigma. I set arithmetic aside, refraining from delving into complex operations, and shifted my focus to the words inscribed: Kilmorden Castle.",1
"""What's that?” “Jack Renauld must have known the layout of the golf course. He anticipated the body would be found quickly once the bunker was dug.” Giraud burst out laughing. “That's absurd! He wanted the body to be discovered! Without its discovery, he couldn't claim his inheritance.” A hint of green flickered in Poirot's eyes as he stood up. “So why bury it?” he inquired softly. “Think about it, Giraud.",1
"""He retreated, leaving me to ponder the bombshell dropped. Who was the mysterious woman who visited my cabin on the night of the 22nd? The realization of my adversaries' cleverness and boldness weighed heavily on me. Gathering my composure, I exited my cabin and headed towards Mrs. Blair's. I rapped on the door. ""Who's there?"" her voice inquired from inside. ""It's Anne Beddingfeld."" ""Oh, come in, Gipsy girl."" I stepped inside. The room was scattered with clothes, and Mrs. Blair was adorned in a stunning kimono that was a mix of orange, gold, and black, leaving me envious.""",1
"…I barely had time to entertain the chilling idea that had crossed my mind before Jack Renauld was led into the room. Poirot greeted him with a professional nod. ""Please, have a seat, sir.

"""Mrs. Opalsen, despite her size, leapt up energetically from her seat towards him. 'I am a firm believer in luck,' she declared. 'It was destined for us to meet under these circumstances tonight. I trust that you will be able to retrieve my pearls.' Poirot, with a calming gesture, assured her, 'Do not worry, madame. Hercule Poirot will assist you.' Mr. Opalsen then addressed the police inspector.""",1
"""Pardon me, but is there any conceivable connection among the four individuals?” “I’m not following you.” “Let me be direct. Did those four men engage in any behavior that could be interpreted as disrespect towards the spirit of Men-her-Ra?” The doctor stared at Poirot in disbelief. “You must be joking, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you haven’t fallen for all that nonsense?” “Complete rubbish,” Willard muttered irritably. Poirot remained calm and composed, his green cat-like eyes blinking slightly. “So you don’t subscribe to it, doctor?” “Absolutely not,” the doctor asserted firmly. “I am a man of science, and I only believe in what science dictates.”",1
"Lord Estair hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly. “You know me?” Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures. How should I not know you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.” “You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!” said my friend grandiloquently. “It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.” “We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge. “The injury is serious, then?” I asked. “What injury?” “The bullet wound.” “Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.” “As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.” “There has been a second attempt, then?” “Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has disappeared.”",1
"I wondered what Miss Pettigrew thought of me. Did she believe I had a habit of conjuring Anne Beddingfeld out of thin air at midnight? Quite compromising for a man of my standing. ""I assume she's in bed,"" I stated coolly. Throat cleared, I glanced at Miss Pettigrew, indicating I was prepared to continue dictating. Hopefully Mrs. Blair would catch on. No such luck. Ignoring my silent plea, she collapsed into a chair, agitatedly waving a slippered foot. ""She's not in her room. I've checked.""",1
"""Pagett my dear,"" I began, ""why must the unfortunate fellow be shadowed as he wanders on deck? Many people find sleeping on deck quite uncomfortable, if you ask me. Those sailors drench the entire deck, passengers included, at five in the morning."" The thought made me cringe. ""Moreover,"" I added, ""if you persist in disturbing some poor soul afflicted with insomnia, it is no surprise that he retaliated."" Pagett appeared unfazed. ""Allow me to explain, Sir Eustace. I was certain the individual had been lurking near your quarters where he had no legitimate reason to be.""",1
"It came as a surprise when he informed me that there was no camera to be found. Every single one of Carton's belongings had been meticulously searched in the hope of uncovering something that could shed light on his frame of mind. He was adamant that there was no trace of any photographic equipment whatsoever. This revelation certainly threw a wrench in my hypothesis. If he did not possess a camera, then why was he in possession of a roll of film? Determined to get to the bottom of this mystery, I set out bright and early the following day to have my valuable roll developed. Without hesitation, I made my way to the bustling Kodak store on Regent Street. After handing over my roll, I requested a print of each individual film. The employee, who had just finished organizing a pile of films stored in yellow tin canisters designed for tropical climates, reached for my roll.",1
"I then noticed the distinctive pig-tail and embroidered robe, immediately identifying him as a Chinaman. She paused, a shiver running down her spine. The butler returned, exchanging hushed words with Lord Yardly. ""A visitor from Mr. Hoffberg's, my lord. He claims you are anticipating his arrival."" ""Good gracious!"" exclaimed the flustered nobleman. ""I suppose I must meet with him. But not here, Mullings, take him to the library."" I motioned for Poirot to join me.",1
"""I noticed that these letters were not delivered through the mail,"" she remarked.   ""Yes, they were hand-delivered by a Chinaman. That fact alone sends chills down my spine,"" he responded.   ""And why is that?""   ""Because it was a Chinese man in San Francisco who sold Gregory the diamond three years ago.""   ""I understand now, madam. You suspect that the diamond in question is none other than 'The Western Star,'"" he concluded.   ""Exactly. Gregory recalls that there was a mysterious tale linked to the gem, but the man who sold it to him was tight-lipped. Gregory described him as extremely anxious and eager to part ways with the stone.""",1
"""In the dead of night, I stood at the entrance of the Mill House. The door creaked open, and a tall, stern woman emerged. “No one's allowed in here! Sick of reporters,” she snapped. “The house isn't for rent,” she added, rejecting my order. I inquired about the drains, and she mentioned a foreign lady murdered on the premises. As we chatted, she described the woman's appearance and behavior. The woman was found dead the next day, leading to a police investigation. The woman's mention of a shiny-chinned man piqued my interest. I accepted the keys and proceeded inside, feeling a sense of dread. The house exuded an eerie atmosphere, stirring up a feeling of impending doom.""",1

"As we made our way back to the house, M. Bex hurriedly excused himself, stating that he needed to inform the examining magistrate of Giraud's unexpected appearance. Giraud, on the other hand, seemed pleased when Poirot announced he had gathered all necessary information. Before we left, Giraud was seen meticulously scouring the area on hands and knees, displaying a level of thoroughness that I found quite impressive.",1
"Colonel Race and Miss Anne Beddingfeld sat in silence on the rocky hill, overlooking the rugged beauty of the landscape. The wind whispered through the giant boulders, creating an eerie atmosphere. Suddenly, Colonel Race turned to Miss Beddingfeld with a piercing gaze. ""What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?"" he questioned abruptly. Miss Beddingfeld met his gaze head-on, her eyes revealing a hint of wariness. ""What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?"" she countered deliberately. Colonel Race seemed momentarily taken aback before responding, a hint of grim amusement in his voice. ""Pursuing ambition,"" he replied cryptically. As they made their way back to Bulawayo, an unexpected encounter with starving cats led to a clash of ideologies between the two. Despite Miss Beddingfeld's compassionate plea, Colonel Race stood firm in his decision, emphasizing the harsh realities of life. Miss Beddingfeld, defeated yet determined, reluctantly acquiesced, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.",1
"Sir Eustace abruptly stopped speaking about the labor situation and fixed his gaze on me. Miss Pettigrew, despite her composed demeanor, visibly startled at his sudden pause. “Goodness gracious!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I choose you,” I whispered. “My dear,” responded Sir Eustace. “You may hold my hand now.” Miss Pettigrew cleared her throat, prompting Sir Eustace to retract his hand hastily. “Right,” he continued. “Now, where were we? Ah, yes. Tylman Roos, during his address at— Why aren't you jotting this down?” Colonel Race interjected softly, “I believe Miss Pettigrew's pencil has broken.”",1

While Norman and I stayed in the car, Poirot and a detective approached the imposing front door. When it swung open, a startled maid stood before them. The detective wasted no time in declaring their official business. A woman, presumably the mistress of the house, appeared and accused them of being burglars. Without missing a beat, Poirot took action, blowing a whistle that signaled a turn of events.",1
"Poirot meticulously arranged the cups and saucers, a stark contrast to our landlady’s careless tossing. With a heavy breath, he fogged the metal teapot, buffing it with a silk handkerchief. Nearby, a kettle simmered while an enamel saucepan held Poirot's beloved thick, sweet chocolate. The doorbell rang sharply, signaling Japp's arrival. ""Hope I'm not late,"" he said, entering briskly to join us.",1

He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.” Poirot nodded. “Précisement! We can return to this point later.",1
"""Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race. “Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a stern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn’t been asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend. I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in sight. We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your father? A very interesting man on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head. Had he been pumping me? Were those slight inaccuracies just tests to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) There is something to be said for life on board ship. It is peaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar. What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him. On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent Bridge players and one decent-looking woman Mrs. Clarence Blair. I’ve met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her, and should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn ass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her. He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work. What the devil does any one want to work for on board ship? It is true that I promised my publishers my “Reminiscences” early in the summer, but what of it? Who really reads reminiscences? Old ladies in the suburbs. And what do my reminiscences amount to? I’ve knocked against a certain number of so-called famous people in my lifetime. With the assistance of Pagett, I invent insipid anecdotes about them. And, the truth of the matter is, Pagett is too honest for the job. He won’t let me invent anecdotes about the people I might have met but haven’t. I tried kindness with him. “You look a perfect wreck still, my dear chap,” I said easily. “What you need is a deck-chair in the sun. No not another word. The work must wait.” The next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin. “There’s no room to work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It’s full of trunks.” From his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles, something that had no business to be there. I explained to him that, though he might not be aware of the fact, it was usual to take a change of clothing with one when travelling. He gave the wan smile with which he always greets my attempts at humour, and then reverted to the business in hand. “And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes” he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?” Sarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us. He seems to regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand, regard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful. “We’ll get an extra cabin,” I said hastily. The thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?” “The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,” replied Pagett seriously. “But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there’s something very queer about that cabin.” Memories of reading The Upper Berth floated through my mind. “If you mean that it’s haunted,” I said, “we’re not going to sleep there, so I don’t see that it matters. Ghosts don’t affect typewriters.” Pagett said that it wasn’t a ghost, and that, after all, he hadn’t got Cabin 17. He told me a long, garbled story. Apparently he, and a Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come to blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and Pagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter. “Both 13 and 28 are better cabins,” he reiterated. “But they wouldn’t look at them.” “Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look. “You told me to get Cabin 17.” There is a touch of the “boy upon the burning deck” about Pagett. “My dear fellow,” I said testily, “I mentioned No. 17 because I happened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn’t mean you to make a stand to the death about it 13 or 28 would have done us equally well.” He looked hurt. “There’s something more, though,” he insisted. “Miss Beddingfeld got the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.” I looked at him severely. “If you’re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who is a missionary though a perfectly poisonous person and that attractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don’t believe a word of it,” I said coldly. “Anne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl with particularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.” Pagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld’s legs. He is the sort of man who never notices legs himself or, if he does, would die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way, you’d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for me.” “Surely you will not go in fancy dress?” said Pagett, in tones of horror. I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained. I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett was too tempting to be forborne. “What do you mean?” I said. “Of course I shall wear fancy dress. So will you.” Pagett shuddered. “So go down to the barber’s and see about it,” I finished. “I don’t think he’ll have any out sizes,” murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye. Without meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive. “And order a table for six in the saloon,” I said. “We’ll have the Captain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair” “You won’t get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,” Pagett interposed. “He’s asked her to dine with him, I know.” Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. “Who is Race?” I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. “They say he’s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don’t know for certain.” “Isn’t that like the Government?” I exclaimed. “Here’s a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone.” Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice. “If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started” “My dear fellow,” I interrupted brutally, “that was a bilious attack. You’re always having bilious attacks.” Pagett winced slightly. “It wasn’t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time “For God’s sake, don’t go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don’t want to hear them.” “Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!” “Ah!” I said. “You’ve been talking to Rayburn.” He did not deny it. “At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.” Pagett’s voice dropped again. “But that’s camouflage, I’m sure. So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson’s feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn’t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: “Don’t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well. I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did not know how intensely respectable he is I should suspect him of some disreputable amou. I wonder now! Even the most respectable menIt would cheer me up enormously if it was so.",1
"Poirot and I were in the room for what felt like an eternity, though it had only been an hour and twenty minutes. Suddenly, a faint scratching noise caught our attention. Poirot signaled me to follow him towards the hall where the sound was coming from. He whispered, ""Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the signal, attack him from behind and restrain him. But watch out, he might be armed."" Shortly after, a ripping sound echoed through the room, and a small beam of light shone through the door.",1
"He appeared in a well-worn, dark blue suit that looked to be tailored, though not brand new. His contorted face revealed the dagger protruding from his left side, just above his heart. The same dagger I had seen the day before, resting in a glass jar. ""The doctor is on his way,"" Giraud said. ""But really, it's quite obvious. The man was stabbed in the heart, death was immediate."" ""Was it last night?"" I asked. Giraud replied with a shake of his head. ""Unlikely.""",1
"Some rumors were circulating, connecting Lord and Lady Yardly to scandalous activities during their visit to the United States. It was whispered that Lord Yardly had indulged in some questionable behavior with the help of female companions, but there was more to the story. One particularly juicy piece of gossip linked Lady Yardly to a famous ""movie"" star in California - none other than Gregory B. Rolf. Miss Marvell hinted at a potential deal with Lord Yardly to film a play at his historic estate, Yardly Chase. The conversation turned to a valuable diamond in the Yardly collection, known as the Star of the East, which had a mysterious origin. The discussion was cut short when Miss Marvell mentioned an intriguing article in Society Gossip magazine about famous jewels, hinting at a deeper connection to the Yardly family's prized possession.",1
"""Pas du tout,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""Japp and the local inspector will share the credit. However,"" he patted his pocket, ""I have a check from Mr. Opalsen. So, my friend, what do you say? Shall we come back next weekend at my cost since this one didn't go as planned?""

This secret has been closely kept, with not even a hint reaching the Press.",1
"We need your help urgently. My brother Jack is in prison, accused of a crime he didn't commit. Please, come quickly. ""MARIE DUBOIS."" I handed it back, concerned. ""You will go?"" ""Immediately. We'll arrange transportation."" Half an hour later found us at the Dubois residence. Marie was waiting at the door, visibly distressed. ""Thank you for coming. I don't know what to do. They won't let me see him in prison. I can't bear this agony,"" she sobbed. ""Is it true that he's not denying the crime? But that's impossible. I refuse to believe it,"" she cried. Poirot reassured her, ""I also find it hard to believe, mademoiselle. Perhaps he's protecting someone."" Marie's eyes narrowed. ""Protecting someone? His mother, perhaps? I've always suspected her. Who stands to inherit his vast fortune? She does. And that secretary, Stonor, he's involved too. They are too close for comfort. She may be older, but men don't mind if a woman is wealthy!"" Poirot intervened, ""Stonor claims he was in England. But can we trust him?"" Poirot then asked, ""Do you know your mother's real name?"" Marie broke down in tears. Poirot continued, ""Did you know who M. Renauld was?"" Marie looked puzzled. Poirot explained the case to her, leaving her in awe. ""You are incredible. You must save him,"" she pleaded. The next morning, we attended Jack's interrogation. He looked worn out and desperate, as if he hadn't slept in days.",1
"""We never considered that."" ""As I mentioned,"" M. Hautet added, ""initially the case appeared straightforward, but the presence of the masked intruders and the mysterious letter from M. Renauld have added layers of complexity. It seems we are now dealing with a completely separate set of circumstances, unrelated to the initial situation. Regarding the letter addressed to you, is there a possibility that it could be connected to this individual named 'Bella' and her alleged threats?"" Poirot dismissed the idea with a shake of his head. ""Unlikely. Someone like M. Renauld, with a history of daring exploits in remote locations, would not seek protection from a woman."" The examining magistrate concurred with a firm nod.",1
"Jack Renauld was adamant that he had no knowledge of any enemies his father may have had in Santiago or elsewhere in South America. He maintained that he had seen no change in his father's behavior recently and had never heard him mention a secret. He believed the trip to South America was related to business matters. When M. Hautet paused, Giraud interjected, expressing a desire to ask his own questions. The magistrate allowed it, albeit coldly. Giraud then inquired if Jack had a good relationship with his father, to which Jack confidently replied that he did.",1
"""The suspect must have escaped through the window before we arrived,"" the officer explained. ""Mrs. Havering asked me to fetch the authorities, a five-mile walk there and back. The constable remained overnight and the London detective arrived the next morning."" ""Can you describe the man who visited Mr. Pace?"" the detective inquired. The housekeeper thought for a moment. ""He had a black beard, appeared middle-aged, and wore a light overcoat. Other than his American accent, I didn't pay much attention to his appearance."" ""I understand,"" replied the detective.",1
"Poirot informed Mrs. Renauld that he was aware of her secret and encouraged her to reveal the truth to her son, Jack. Jack discovered that his beloved father was actually a fugitive from justice. Poirot reassured Jack that the truth was safe with him and that there was no need to involve the police. Despite lingering questions from the police, Poirot managed to explain everything convincingly. Jack later decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and secretary, Stonor. Poirot hinted at a girl who loved Jack deeply and had been willing to sacrifice for him. Jack was hesitant, feeling unworthy due to his father's past. Poirot suggested that there was a woman capable of great love and sacrifice for Jack - his mother. This realization softened Jack's heart, leading him to seek out Mademoiselle Bella.",1
"""Rayburn has a scar, but scars can be easily faked. He matches the right height and build.

Suzanne seemed unsure. “Are you sure?” “Yes. Long-headed, with a width less than 75% of its length,” I explained smoothly. A moment of silence followed.",1
"I gazed at her horrified expression, a stark contrast to her once carefree demeanor. Ignoring my advice had led her to this moment, and I found myself devoid of pity. She needed to face the consequences. Carefully, I turned the lifeless body around. ""Look,"" I pointed out, ""he was stabbed in the back."" Her response was barely audible. ""With what?"" I gestured towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Without warning, she stumbled and collapsed. Rushing to her side, I offered assistance. ""You're overwhelmed. Let's get you out of here. This is all too much for you."" ""Water,"" she whispered.",1
"Hercule Poirot remained calm and collected as he revealed the subject of the quarrel to the magistrate. Jack Renauld admitted his love for Mademoiselle Daubreuil, much to the disapproval of his father and mother. Despite their objections, he was determined to marry her. The tension between the Renauld family and Mademoiselle Daubreuil's family was palpable, with Mrs. Renauld showing her disdain for their background. Jack recounted the heated argument with his father, who adamantly opposed the marriage. As the conversation unfolded, secrets and mysteries began to surface, leaving everyone involved in a state of confusion and disbelief. The truth behind the letter found in Mr. Renauld's coat pocket added another layer of intrigue to the already complex situation. The case that initially seemed straightforward and simple was now anything but, leaving the magistrate and detective puzzled and uncertain of how to proceed.",1

The Count reassured her, noting that she had never been formally charged with espionage. ""Here's to the 'Colonel,'"" he toasted with a smile.",1
"""The check was made out to Duveen,"" Poirot remarked.  ""Indeed, it appears to be in M. Renauld's handwriting,"" he added, after a closer examination.  The commissary, feeling foolish, admitted, ""I should have checked the desk sooner."" Poirot chuckled, ""Always check under the mats! My friend Hastings knows I can't stand anything out of place. Just a crooked hearth-rug gave it away to me.""",1
"Count Foscatini’s teeth were dazzlingly white. Despite the coffee stains on the teeth, we deduce that Count Foscatini did not consume any coffee. However, all three cups contained coffee. Why would someone fabricate the idea that Count Foscatini had coffee when he did not? This puzzled me greatly. ""Let me assist you. What proof do we have that Ascanio and his companion, or two imposters posing as them, actually visited the apartment that night? No one witnessed their arrival or departure. We rely solely on the accounts of one person and various inanimate objects."" ""Are you suggesting?"" ""I am referring to the cutlery, plates, and empty dishes. Graves is deceitful and cunning, yet remarkably organized! He overhears part of a conversation in the morning, realizing that Ascanio will be vulnerable. The next evening, around eight o’clock, he informs his employer of a phone call. Foscatini sits down to answer the phone, and Graves strikes him with a marble statue from behind. Following this, a dinner for three is ordered through the service phone! Graves sets the table, uses the plates, knives, and forks, etc. He even consumes the food. Despite being clever, he also has a hearty appetite! But after finishing three tournedos, the rice soufflé proves too much. He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes for added effect. It was a meticulously planned crime! Moving the clock hands to 8.47, he breaks and stops the clock. The only oversight was leaving the curtains undrawn. But in a real dinner party, the curtains would have been closed as soon as it got dark. He then casually mentions the guests to the elevator attendant before rushing to a phone booth. Around 8.47, he calls the doctor using Foscatini's dying voice. The plan was so flawless that no one questioned if a call was made from Flat II at that time."" ""Except for Hercule Poirot, I assume?"" I remarked sarcastically. ""Not even Hercule Poirot,"" my companion replied with a grin. ""I intend to investigate now. I needed to convince you first. But mark my words, I will be proven right; and then Japp, who I have already tipped off, can arrest the upstanding Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has squandered."" Poirot's intuition was accurate, as always. Miss Violet Marsh's case provided a refreshing change from our usual tasks. Poirot had received a prompt and professional note from the lady requesting a meeting, and he had instructed her to visit him at eleven o’clock the next day. She arrived promptly, a tall and attractive young woman, dressed simply yet neatly, exuding confidence and a business-like demeanor. Evidently, a woman determined to succeed.",1
"He had spent years as a wanderer, drifting through the South Sea islands before finally landing back in New York. Struggling to stay afloat, he somehow scraped together the funds for a trip to Egypt, where he had hoped to find refuge with a trusted friend. But fate had other plans.

"“No, no, I must accept the reality that everything here is transparent and legitimate, but who is that?” A tall, sun-kissed young man approached us with confident strides. He walked past us without acknowledging our presence, yet I couldn't help but notice his attractive appearance, marked by a weathered face hinting at a life spent under tropical skies. A gardener, pausing from his leaf-clearing duties, caught Poirot's attention. Without hesitation, Poirot approached him and inquired urgently, ""Please, tell me, who is that man? Have you seen him before?"" ""I can't recall his name, sir, although I believe I heard it once. He was a guest here just last week, stayed for a single night. It was on a Tuesday,"" the gardener responded. ""Hurry, my friend, let us trail him.""",1
"I decided to treat myself, even though too much of a good thing can sometimes be overwhelming. Wearing a hat borrowed from Suzanne and my least wrinkled white linen, I set out after lunch. A quick train ride took me to Muizenberg in just thirty minutes, passing by the beautiful Table Mountain along the way. As we arrived, I was taken aback by the fact that Cape Town is situated on a peninsula, leading me to face the sea once more upon exiting the train. The sight of people enjoying the delightful bathing experience was truly captivating.",1
"""In the absence of my friend Poirot, I took it upon myself to engage with Lady Yardly. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, I made a bold deduction - she had come seeking help due to receiving blackmailing letters about a diamond. My theory was proven correct by Lady Yardly's shocked reaction. She confirmed the receipt of such letters, detailing their mysterious nature and a hint of an Eastern influence. Unfortunately, the letters had been destroyed, leaving us with no concrete leads. Lady Yardly departed, leaving me to recount the events to Poirot upon his return. His questioning revealed a hint of jealousy at having missed out on the action.""",1

It was a peculiar period of time.",1
"The ""Colonel"" and his crew could not suspect that there was any connection between me and the man they had chosen to take the fall for the Marlow murder. The victim remained unidentified, but I had a hunch. I decided to reach out to Lord Nasby, proposing that the woman was none other than the renowned Russian dancer ""Nadina"" who had captivated audiences in Paris for years. Surprisingly, she had not been identified yet, but in hindsight, it made sense. Nadina had never set foot in England during her illustrious Parisian career.",1

"When Bella Duveen left, it was half-past ten. The wrist watch revealed the crime occurred before midnight. The tramp, found dead, had been deceased for at least forty-eight hours, possibly twenty-four more. Time was a crucial element in this crime.",1
"I knew I couldn't keep going it alone. But what choice did I have? The city was swarming with cops. I had to be more careful this time. They wouldn't catch me like they did in Muizenberg. As the train pulled into Adderly Street, I made my move. I strolled up the left side, trying not to think about the shadow behind me. I stepped into Cartwright's and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas. It was no whiskey, but it did the trick for my nerves.",1
"""You will have to decide for yourself."" With a dramatic gesture, he swung the salon door open, motioning for us to enter. Jack Renauld was left in the hands of the two remaining men. Giraud confidently placed his hat on the table and began his lecture on detective work, his words dripping with sarcasm. Poirot, ever the composed listener, settled in to hear what the younger detective had to say. ""Let me show you the methods of the modern detective,"" Giraud boasted. Poirot simply nodded, his eyes closed in a display of attentive listening. ""Rest assured, I am wide awake and fully engaged,"" Poirot interjected briefly before returning to his facade of deep concentration.",1
"Poirot asked about Mrs. Renauld's well-being. Léonie expressed concern, noting her sadness and lack of appetite. She described Mrs. Renauld as ghostly pale, lamenting the heartbreaking sight. Poirot acknowledged Léonie's observation, remarking on the forgiving nature of a woman in love. Despite this, he questioned whether there had been any arguments between the couple recently. Léonie denied this, stating that there had been no such conflicts.",1
"I was fortunate. My target was standing near the railing, sipping his beef tea. Approaching him, I smiled and said, “I trust you have forgiven my claim to Cabin 17.” Mr. Chichester replied coldly, “I consider holding a grudge unchristian.” As the conversation continued, my suspicions grew. His lack of sunburn despite claiming to have spent two years in Africa raised red flags. After an incident with a dropped paper, Mr. Chichester's behavior only fueled my doubts. Later, in the lounge, I observed interactions between Sir Eustace, Pagett, Mrs. Blair, and Colonel Race, noting peculiarities in Pagett's behavior. The discussion about Italy and Pagett's reaction hinted at hidden secrets. As the scene unfolded, the atmosphere grew tense, leaving me more convinced of the need to investigate further.",1

Quite a curious tale. But now, why don't you tell us exactly what went down on that dreadful night?"" ""Ain't much to say. I came from Cherbourg, like I said, to see Marthe before hittin' the road.

Let's not waste any time."" Poirot gently held me back. ""Go ahead if you must, my friend, but if you do, I wouldn't inquire about the two strangers.""",1
"""He was transported across the Channel by naval destroyer. Upon arrival at Boulogne, he was met by a vehicle from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.” “And then?” “They departed from Boulogne but never reached their destination.” “What happened?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a fake vehicle with a false A.D.C. The genuine car was discovered in a side street, with the driver and the A.D.C. securely gagged and tied up.” “And the imposter vehicle?” “Remains at large.” Poirot expressed his frustration with a gesture. “Unbelievable! Surely it cannot evade detection for long?” “That was our assumption. It appeared to be a matter of thorough investigation. That region of France is under Military Law. We were confident that the vehicle would not go unnoticed for long. The French authorities, our Scotland Yard detectives, and the military personnel are putting in every effort. It is, as you say, unbelievable but nothing has been uncovered!” Just then, a knock sounded at the door, and a young officer entered with a tightly sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Fresh from France, sir. I brought it straight here, as per your instructions.” The Minister eagerly tore it open, and exclaimed. The officer departed. “Finally, some news! This telegram has just been deciphered. They have located the second vehicle, along with the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C. He recalls nothing, except feeling something pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to break free. The authorities are confident in the veracity of his account.” “And nothing else was found?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s deceased body? Then, there is hope. But it is perplexing. Why, after an attempted shooting this morning, are they now going to such lengths to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing is certain. They are resolute in their efforts to prevent him from attending the Conference at any cost.” “If it is humanly feasible, the Prime Minister will be present. May God grant it is not too late. Now, gentlemen, give me a full account from the beginning. I must be informed about the shooting incident as well.” “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same individual who went with him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they drove down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister had an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to London, and it was during the journey that the attempted assassination occurred.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? Do you have his background?” Lord Estair smiled. “I anticipated you would ask that. We do not possess much information about him. He is not from a notable family. He has served in the British Army, and is a very competent secretary, with exceptional language skills. I believe he is fluent in seven languages. That is why the Prime Minister selected him to accompany him to France.” “Does he have any family in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, residing in Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, living close to Ascot.” “Ascot? Isn't that near Windsor?” “That connection has not been disregarded. But it has yielded no results.” “Do you consider Capitaine Daniels to be beyond suspicion?” A touch of bitterness seeped into Lord Estair’s tone as he responded: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In this day and age, I would hesitate before declaring anyone beyond suspicion.” ""Très bien.""",1

When he shifted his attention, suspicions arose instantly. The threatening contents of the letter were clear. Initially, the case seemed straightforward - jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back initially pointed to a female culprit."" Poirot acknowledged this, adding, ""The stabbing, yes, but not the burial!

Yet he was found dead nearby, almost within hearing distance of the house. Furthermore, it seems too convenient that a weapon like the dagger was left lying around, easily accessible.""",1
"There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts. From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.” The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt? I wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s reply was prompt: “Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.” Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required. Taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on the fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention that inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot’s prognostication. No such woman as “Mrs. Middleton” had ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection. “Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.” “It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?” “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “Précisément and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.” “Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.” “And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.” “If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly. “And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.” “I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.” “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway” “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.” “Who is his uncle?” “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.” “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?” “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.” “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty. Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm. “You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile. “I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question.",1
"Poirot observed the dagger, carefully examining the wound. His eyes gleamed with anticipation. ""The lack of blood is peculiar,"" he noted. ""The blade shows only slight discoloration. What is your opinion, Doctor?"" The doctor could only conclude, ""It is highly unusual."" Poirot disagreed, stating confidently, ""It is not unusual at all. The man was already deceased when stabbed."" Calmly silencing the surrounding voices, Poirot turned to Giraud and continued, ""M. Giraud, this case is far from ordinary.""",1
"""Did you turn up your nose and claim it was sordid work when you were summoned to this task?"" ""No, but-"" ""If you were here on vacation, wouldn't you be investigating just like I am now? Of course you would."" ""I'm a man. You're a woman."" ""Your perception of a woman is someone who would jump on a chair and scream at the sight of a mouse. That's outdated. But will you give me a tour, please? It could have a significant impact on me."" ""How so?"" ""They're excluding all the journalists. I could get a major exclusive with one of the newspapers. You can't imagine how much they pay for insider information."" I hesitated.",1
"I yanked the cabin trunk closer and demanded in a harsh tone: “Show yourself now.” Silence greeted me. I bent down to look under the bunk. The figure lying there remained motionless. He appeared to be in a deep slumber. I shook his shoulder, but he didn't stir. Irritated, I muttered to myself, “He must be passed out cold. What a mess.” Suddenly, a crimson stain on the floor caught my eye. With great effort, I pulled the man towards the center of the cabin. The pallor of his face indicated that he had lost consciousness. It didn't take long to discover the reason. A brutal wound gaped under his left shoulder-blade. Removing his coat, I resolved to treat the injury at once.",1

Madame Daubreuil, then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were,"" he paused tactfully. ""Eh? Was it really them?"" ""Who's to say? But what can you do? Monsieur, he was a very wealthy English lord and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one, yet very stylish despite living so modestly with her daughter.""",1

The lack of labels on his garments hinted at a desire to hide his true self. Perhaps he was running from something? We can't be certain yet, but it's clear he was keen on concealing his identity, just as we are eager to uncover it."" Giraud's gaze returned to the body. ""Once again, no fingerprints on the dagger handle. The killer wore gloves."" ""Could it be the same person responsible for both deaths?"" I inquired. Giraud's expression became unreadable. ""My thoughts are irrelevant. Time will tell. Marchaud!"" The officer appeared promptly. ""Yes, sir?"" ""Where is Madame Renauld? I sent for her some time ago."" ""She's making her way here now, sir, along with her son."" ""Excellent. I only need one of them at a time, though."" Marchaud saluted and left. Moments later, Mrs. Renauld entered the room. ""Here is Madame,"" announced Marchaud. Giraud approached her with a quick nod. ""This way, madame."" Leading her closer, he suddenly stepped aside. ""Do you recognize him?"" His gaze bore into her, observing every nuance. Mrs. Renauld remained composed, almost too composed. She glanced at the body with little interest, showing no signs of distress or recognition. ""No,"" she stated firmly. ""I have never seen him before. He is a stranger to me."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Completely."" ""You don't see any resemblance to your attackers?"" Giraud probed. She hesitated briefly. ""No, I don't believe so. They wore false beards, as the magistrate noted, but still, no."" Her certainty solidified. ""I am positive this man was not involved."" ""Very well, madame. That will be all,"" Giraud dismissed her. With poise, she exited, the sunlight catching the silver strands in her hair. Jack Renauld followed, also unable to identify the deceased naturally. Giraud grunted, his emotions concealed. He called for Marchaud: ""Is the other one ready?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Bring her in."" Madame Daubreuil entered, protesting vehemently. ""This is an outrage! What do I have to do with any of this?"" Giraud cut her off. ""I am investigating two murders, not one! You could be responsible for both, for all I know."" ""How dare you!"" she exclaimed. ""How dare you accuse me of such crimes! It's preposterous."" Giraud held up the hair, challenging her. ""See this, madame?"" He approached her. ""May I compare?"" She recoiled, pale. ""It's fake, I swear. I am innocent of these crimes, both of them.""",1
"""You see, my affections lie elsewhere.""  ""I understand,"" he replied.  ""Was that the case when we first met on the Kilmorden?""  ""No,"" I admitted softly. ""It developed afterwards.""  ""I see,"" he acknowledged once more, but this time his tone held a sense of purpose that made me turn to face him. His expression was more serious than ever before.  ""What do you mean?"" I stammered.  He gazed at me, unreadable yet commanding.  ""Simply that I now comprehend my path forward.""  His declaration sent a chill down my spine. The determination in his words was unsettling and unfamiliar.",1
"""He discovers the woman he never stopped loving."" ""Ah, sentimentality,"" Poirot cautioned. ""Where there is hate, there is also love,"" I stated, perhaps incorrectly. ""In any case, he locates her, using a different name. However, she now has a new partner, an Englishman named Renauld. Georges Conneau, fueled by past grievances, clashes with Renauld. He ambushes Renauld while he visits his lover, stabbing him in the back. Overwhelmed by guilt, he begins to dig a grave.""",1
"Evidently, it seemed that she had mistakenly revealed the wrong location. Another possibility crossed my mind. Could it have been intentional? Was she purposely concealing her identity and providing me with false information? The more I pondered this, the more certain I became that my latter assumption was accurate. It appeared that for some undisclosed reason, she had no desire for our acquaintance to progress further. While this had been my own sentiment just half an hour earlier, I found it disconcerting to now be on the receiving end. The entire situation left much to be desired, and I made my way to Villa Geneviève feeling distinctly out of sorts. Instead of approaching the house, I headed up the path to a small bench near the shed, where I sat ruminating. My thoughts were interrupted by voices nearby. After a moment, I realized they were not emanating from the garden I occupied, but from the neighboring garden of Villa Marguerite, drawing closer by the second. A familiar female voice, belonging to the lovely Marthe, could be heard. ""Chéri,"" she said, ""is it really true? Are all our troubles over?"" Jack Renauld responded, ""You know it, Marthe. Nothing can keep us apart now, my beloved. The final obstacle to our union has been eliminated. Nothing can separate us."" ""Nothing?"" Marthe whispered. ""Oh, Jack, Jack I am afraid."" Sensing my unintended intrusion, I prepared to leave but caught a glimpse of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood facing me, Jack with his arm around Marthe, gazing into each other's eyes. They appeared a striking pair, the dark, sturdy young man and the fair, radiant maiden. Despite the dark cloud of tragedy hanging over their youth, they seemed perfectly suited to one another, radiating happiness. Yet, a shadow crossed Marthe's face, noticed by Jack as he drew her closer and inquired, ""But what troubles you, my darling? What is there to fear now?"" It was then that I saw the fear in her eyes, the same look Poirot had described, as she softly uttered, so that I almost caught the words, ""I am afraid for you..."" Unable to hear Jack's response, I was distracted by a peculiar sight further down the hedge. A brown bush seemed out of place for early summer. As I approached, the bush hastily retreated, revealing itself to be Giraud, who gestured for silence and led me away from eavesdropping range. ""What were you doing there?"" I inquired. ""Precisely what you were doing,"" he replied. ""But I was not there intentionally!"" ""Ah,"" Giraud remarked. ""I was."" Though I held a certain admiration for the man, I also harbored a dislike for him. With a disdainful look, he remarked, ""You did not help matters by interfering. I could have gleaned useful information in a moment. Where is your elderly companion?""",1
"""The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor the case is like this. There must be no reservations. You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might enfin!” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs. Poirot fit into all this?”",1
"""Chichester was seen leaving Miss Beddingfeld's cabin in a secretive manner this morning,"" I stated firmly, giving him a stern look. ""I refuse to entertain any scandalous gossip about Chichester, despite his missionary status and less than pleasant personality, or the charming Anne Beddingfeld,"" I added with a cold tone. ""Miss Beddingfeld is a lovely young woman with exceptional legs. In fact, I dare say she possesses the most beautiful legs on this entire ship."" Pagett appeared displeased by my mention of Anne Beddingfeld's legs.",1
"How much for first class to Cape Town?"" I asked. ""Eighty-seven pounds,"" the man replied. The coincidence was uncanny - the exact amount of my inheritance. ""First class,"" I stated firmly, fully committed to the upcoming adventure.",1
"“Shall we return to London, my friend?” “Do you believe it to be necessary, Hastings? And why?” “You see” I cleared my throat “the situation has not unfolded favorably, has it? You assured Lord Yardly that he could trust you to resolve everything, yet the diamond disappeared right in front of you!” “Indeed,” Poirot admitted, looking somewhat defeated. “It was not one of my finest moments.” His nonchalant remark almost tempted me to chuckle, but I remained resolute.",1
"""And my cramped quarters were hardly conducive to our work,"" I remarked, knowing Pagett's penchant for securing the best cabin on the ship. ""It's a shame the Captain couldn't accommodate you this time,"" I added with a hint of sarcasm. ""Would you like to lighten your load by storing some of your excess baggage in my cabin?"" Sarcasm was a risky game to play with someone like Pagett. His face lit up immediately. ""If only I could offload the typewriter and that massive stationery trunk,"" he mused. The stationery trunk, an object of considerable weight, had caused numerous headaches with the porters and had become Pagett's personal mission to pass it off onto me. Our ongoing battle of wills continued unabated.",1
"I could hear her distinctive voice next, loud and crisp, tinged with a hint of an unfamiliar accent: ‘Marlow’s Mill House. Belongs to Sir Eustace Pedler. It has a certain appeal to me. I shall pay it a visit.’ With that, she was handed a note by the man and exited with an air of arrogance fit for a queen. Despite no acknowledgment towards Carton, it was evident that their encounter was arranged in advance. My mind raced with assumptions. Unaware of Sir Eustace’s whereabouts in Cannes, I mistakenly believed the house search was a mere guise to rendezvous with him at the Mill House.",1
"""Have you considered investing in sea sick remedy, Poirot?"" I remarked slyly, recalling our earlier conversation. Poirot, focused on the weather, turned to me with a reproachful look. ""Have you forgotten the method of Laverguier? I always practice it. Balancing oneself, turning the head, breathing in and out,"" he explained. I raised an eyebrow skeptically. ""You'll be balancing and counting six by the time you reach your destination."" ""I do not run around making journeys,"" Poirot responded. ""My work is done from within,"" tapping his forehead. My argumentative side emerged. ""But the study of details like finger-prints, footprints, and other clues is vital!"" Poirot disagreed, claiming that true psychology and logical deduction are more important. Our debate shifted to fox hunting, with Poirot making a humorous analogy. As we disembarked in Calais, I refrained from disturbing Poirot's solitude. The lack of a car did not deter us, as we cheerfully hired one to continue our journey. Poirot remained focused on the task at hand, while I remained optimistic about our adventure. Poirot, however, expressed a sense of foreboding, hinting at a challenging and troublesome problem ahead. As we approached the Villa Geneviève in Merlinville, Poirot's premonition weighed heavily on my mind.",1
"""Aha!” exclaimed M. Hautet, nodding at the young man. “You didn't end up boarding the Anzora, did you?”  “No, sir. I was just about to tell you, the Anzora was delayed for twenty-four hours due to engine issues. I was supposed to set sail last night, but when I bought an evening paper, I read about the terrible tragedy that had occurred ” His voice faltered, tears welling up in his eyes. “My dear father my poor, poor, father.” Mrs. Renauld, staring at him in disbelief, echoed: “So you never left?” Then, with a look of utter exhaustion, she whispered to herself, “It doesn't matter now.” “Please, take a seat, M.",1
"By following my instructions, Mrs. Renauld rejected her son and announced her plan to draft a will the next day that would disinherit him completely. It was a drastic measure, but a required one, and Madame Renauld was fully willing to take the chance even though she forgot to mention her change of room. I assumed she assumed I already knew. Everything unfolded as I anticipated. Marthe Daubreuil attempted one final desperate grab for the Renauld fortune and came up short! ""What truly astounds me,"" I remarked, ""is how she managed to enter the premises undetected. It's truly a mystery.""",1
"""Excuse my ignorance, madame, but is it necessary to bring the diamond to Yardly Chase?"" Miss Marvell's innocent facade vanished, replaced by a steely gaze that aged her instantly. ""I intend to showcase it there."" ""Ah, yes,"" I interjected, ""Yardly is known for its impressive jewel collection, including a notable diamond."" Miss Marvell simply nodded in agreement.",1
"I couldn’t shake the feeling that a breakfast of double bacon and a cozy jumper would liven up our dreary Island existence, before heading out to settle our debts. Suzanne was more subdued post-breakfast, and we were given neighboring rooms overlooking Table Bay. While Suzanne rummaged for her face cream, I admired the view. Once she found her cream and began applying it, she was ready to listen. ""Did you see Sir Eustace?"" I inquired. ""He stormed out of the breakfast room as we entered. Complaining about some bad fish, he bounced a peach on the floor to prove its hardness, only to have it squish under his foot."" Suzanne chuckled. ""Sir Eustace despises early mornings as much as I do. But, Anne, did you notice Mr. Pagett? I ran into him in the hallway, sporting a black eye. What could he have been up to?"" ""Probably just attempting to toss me overboard,"" I responded casually. Suzanne, intrigued, demanded details. As I filled her in, she exclaimed, ""It's all becoming more and more mysterious. I thought I'd have an easy time keeping an eye on Sir Eustace, and you’d handle the Reverend Edward Chichester, but now I’m not so certain. I hope Pagett doesn't try to shove me off the train one dark night."" ""You’re still in the clear, Suzanne. But if things take a turn for the worse, I'll send a message to Clarence."" ""That reminds me, fetch me a cable form. Let’s see, what should I write? 'Involved in a thrilling mystery, kindly send a thousand pounds immediately, Suzanne.'"" I took the form and suggested eliminating unnecessary words, but Suzanne, unconcerned with frugality, added even more: ""having a blast."" Suzanne had plans to lunch with her friends, who arrived at the hotel around eleven to fetch her. Left to my own devices, I wandered through the hotel grounds, crossed the tram tracks, and strolled down a shady avenue to the main street. I explored, basking in the sunlight and perusing the street vendors. I stumbled upon a spot that served delectable ice cream sodas. Eventually, I bought a basket of peaches and made my way back to the hotel. To my delight, a note awaited me. It was from the Museum curator, who had seen my arrival on the Kilmorden and knew my late father, Professor Beddingfeld. He invited me for tea at their villa in Muizenberg that afternoon, as his wife was eager to meet me.",1
"""Upon entering, I noticed the door ajar.” “Were all the other ground floor windows secured?” “Yes, every single one. No signs of anything amiss.” “Very well, Françoise, you may leave.” The elderly woman made her way to the exit, pausing briefly before speaking. “I must warn you, sir. Madame Daubreuil is not to be trusted. A woman knows another woman's true nature. Remember that.” With a knowing look, Françoise departed. “Léonie Oulard,” the magistrate called out. Léonie entered, visibly distraught and on the verge of hysteria. M. Hautet handled her delicately.",1
"""Poirot,"" I said, ""I apologize for my actions. I know I have mistreated you, but sometimes circumstances leave me no choice. Moving forward, I must follow my own path."" Poirot acknowledged my words with a series of nods. ""I understand,"" he replied. The playful glint in his eyes had vanished, replaced by a genuine sincerity and compassion that caught me off guard. ""You see, my friend, it's love. Not the idealized version you envisioned, but a love that arrives with wounds and hardships. I had warned you.""",1
"""22. I have no idea how Minks managed to infiltrate Cabin 17. It must have been pure intuition.” “And the message to General Smuts? Who altered it?” “Anne, do you really think I would reveal my plans so easily? With a fugitive killer as my secretary, I had no qualms about using blank pages instead. No one would suspect dear old Pedler.” “And Colonel Race?” “Ah, that was an unpleasant surprise.",1
"M. Renauld, our work here is done. Please listen as your statement is reviewed. I prefer informal proceedings. Originality is key. M. Giraud now leads the case. My sympathies, Madame. Good day to all.",1
"""He glanced at me with an unreadable expression as I sat up, flushed and eager. 'God help me, it's you,' he muttered before quickly leaving. My recovery was swift, with only a knock to the head and a badly twisted arm to show for the ordeal. Initially feared broken, my arm was not as severe as thought, and though painful, it was healing rapidly. It was a peculiar time for us, isolated from the world, together like Adam and Eve but with a stark contrast. Old Batani lingered nearby, as loyal as a faithful hound. Insisting on handling the cooking with one arm, I spent hours with Harry under the palm trees, engaging in deep conversations, arguments, and reconciliations. Despite our bickering, a genuine and enduring bond formed between us, along with something more. As the time approached for me to depart, a heavy feeling settled in my chest. Would he let me leave without a word or gesture? His brooding silences and sudden absences made me anxious. One evening, as the sun set, we sat in the hut's entrance. Lacking hairpins, my long black hair cascaded down my back. Lost in thought, I felt Harry's gaze on me. 'You look like a witch, Anne,' he finally remarked, his tone uncharacteristically tender. He tentatively reached out to touch my hair, causing me to shudder. Abruptly, he stood up, exclaiming, 'You must depart tomorrow. I can't endure this any longer. I'm only human. You must go, Anne. You must. You're not naive. You understand this cannot continue.' 'I suppose not,' I replied slowly. 'But it has been pleasant, hasn't it?' 'Pleasant? It's been torturous!' 'That dreadful?' 'Why do you torment me? Why mock me? Why hide your laughter in your hair?' 'I wasn't laughing. I'm not mocking. If you wish me to leave, I will. But if you want me to stay, I'll stay.' 'Not that!' he cried out vehemently. 'Don't tempt me, Anne. Do you comprehend what I am? A criminal twice condemned. A hunted man. Here, they know me as Harry Parker. They believe I've been on an expedition inland, but soon they may piece it together, and then disaster will strike. Anne, you're so youthful and alluring, possessing a beauty that drives men to madness.'""",1
"But the suggestion was outrageous! To think that she, of all people, would be accused of stealing from Madame! The police, known for their incompetence, were quick to jump to conclusions. Monsieur, a Frenchman “A Belgian,” Poirot corrected, but Célestine ignored him. Monsieur refused to let her take the fall while that despicable chambermaid got away unpunished. She had always distrusted her - a brazen, rosy-cheeked woman who seemed to have a knack for thievery. From the beginning, she had a feeling that she was up to no good.",1
"""Milord, I must inquire if these facts are accurate,"" Poirot began, handing over the document. The peer's face flushed with anger as he scanned the words. ""Absolute rubbish!"" he exclaimed. ""There's no romantic history tied to the diamond. It originated from India, if I recall correctly. This Chinese god nonsense is absurd."" Poirot interjected gently, ""However, the diamond is known as 'The Star of the East.'"" The peer retorted, ""And what of it?"" Poirot, unfazed, continued, ""I urge you to trust me entirely. By doing so, I believe we can prevent a disaster."" The peer, somewhat reluctantly, agreed. Poirot proceeded, ""Now, about Yardly Chase. Is everything settled between you and Mr. Rolf?"" The peer hesitated, his face turning red. ""I've made a mess of things, Monsieur Poirot. I'm drowning in debt, but I want to make things right and stay at the estate. Rolf has offered me a way out, but I despise the idea. I might have to resort to selling the Star of the East,"" he confessed. Poirot, noticing the distress, inquired about Lady Yardly's stance on the matter. The peer explained that she opposed the sale and preferred a different plan involving a film stunt. Poirot, after some contemplation, instructed the peer to return to Yardly Chase, assuring the preservation of the diamond. A perplexed nobleman exited the room. Later that day, we arrived at Yardly Chase to find a family scene unfolding in the hall. Lady Yardly, with her children, welcomed us as her husband looked to Poirot for guidance. Poirot smoothly diverted the conversation to an investigation, engaging with the children and easing the tension in the room. Lady Yardly, though torn, expressed her reluctance towards selling the diamond. As the evening progressed, a telegram arrived, revealing a potential buyer for the diamond. Lady Yardly, conflicted, voiced her reservations about the sale before preparing for dinner, adorned with the precious yet dreaded necklace.",1
"""I had a dream where Marthe Daubreuil's body was discovered in Mrs. Renauld's room, and you accused her of killing Mr. Renauld,"" I said.  ""You weren't dreaming. That actually happened,"" he replied.  ""But Bella Duveen confessed to the murder, didn't she?""  ""No, Hastings, she didn't. She only claimed to protect her lover from being executed.""  ""What?""  ""Think back to Jack Renauld's account. Both Bella and Marthe arrived at the scene simultaneously, each mistaking the other for the killer. The realization dawned on Bella, and she fled in shock.""",1
"""Poirot calmly noted, 'Crimes, however, remain consistent.' Giraud's demeanor immediately turned hostile. He was clearly displeased by the partnership. It was evident that if he discovered a crucial lead, he would likely withhold it. Bex attempted to speak about the examining magistrate, but Giraud cut in abruptly, dismissing the magistrate's significance. 'Forget the magistrate! Time is of the essence. Darkness will soon fall, rendering this scene useless. I am well-acquainted with the details of the case. The residents of the house can manage until tomorrow. The key to solving this murder lies here, in this very spot.""",1
"Poirot and I exchanged bewildered looks when we realized that only 'the Western Star' had been stolen. He quickly stood up and apologized for not being more helpful. After a brief conversation, he disappeared to send a telegram to Lord Yardly, without revealing the contents to me.",1
"""We're negotiating a contract with Lord Yardly to shoot a film at his historic estate."" ""Yardly Chase?"" I exclaimed, intrigued. ""It's a renowned attraction in England."" Miss Marvell confirmed. ""It's the epitome of ancient feudal architecture. However, the price he's asking is quite steep, and the deal is still uncertain. Greg and I always enjoy mixing work with leisure.""",1
"Poirot shook his head. ""Very improbable, my friend. He had no means of disposing of the body. It would have been found by now."" Kellett's version of events states that the object he tossed over the hedge made a slight 'chink' sound, catching the attention of a man in the ditch. After investigating, the man found the missing ring. Lowen vehemently denies this account, casting doubt on Kellett's credibility. Perhaps Davenheim encountered Kellett in the lane, leading to a deadly robbery and murder.",1
"As we arrived at the entrance of Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld gave a questioning look to Poirot. ""Why don't you go ahead and tell my mother that I'm free?"" he suggested. ""And you can inform Mademoiselle Marthe in person,"" Poirot added with a smile. Jack didn't hesitate and hurried to the front door as we continued to Villa Geneviève in the car. ""Poirot,"" I reminisced, ""remember our first day here and the news of Mr. Renauld's murder?"" Poirot nodded. ""So much has changed since then, especially for you, my friend."" ""What about finding Bel – I mean Dulcie?"" I asked impatiently. Poirot assured me, ""I have everything under control."" As we rang the bell, Poirot mused, ""From start to finish, this case is far from satisfying."" I sighed, thinking of the sentimental aspect, but Poirot clarified, ""I mean from a professional perspective. The murder lacks the order and method that a detective appreciates."" Just then, Françoise opened the door, and Poirot went to see Mrs. Renauld while I waited in the salon. When Poirot returned looking serious, he warned me of impending trouble. ""What's wrong?"" I asked, concerned. Poirot explained, ""Women can be quite unpredictable."" Suddenly, Jack and Marthe Daubreuil arrived, and Poirot advised them not to go upstairs to Mrs. Renauld, who was in distress. Mrs. Renauld surprised us all by coming downstairs with Léonie's help, insisting on seeing her son. Jack was taken aback, but Mrs. Renauld was determined to have her way.",1
"Poirot and the commissary crouched down by the flower-bed, inspecting the smooth mould carefully. The tree stood nearby, its roots hidden at the back of the bed. The dry weather meant no footprints could be found on the paths, but the soft mould told a different story. Poirot, deep in thought, suddenly veered towards the other flower-bed for further examination.",1
"""I love you, despite everything. But how can you love me in return?"" She looked at me, desperation in her eyes. ""I don't know,"" I replied, feeling the weight of her words. ""Love is a force beyond our control. I've fought it since the day we met, but it's relentless."" Suddenly, she collapsed to the floor, tears flowing uncontrollably. ""I can't do this anymore,"" she wept. ""I'm lost, I need guidance. Please, someone help me, show me the way."" I knelt beside her, offering what comfort I could in the midst of her turmoil.",1
"“Do we need to go through this?” “Unfortunately, sir, it’s protocol.” “Just let him have it, Ed!” exclaimed his wife anxiously. “I would feel more at ease if he did. I wouldn’t be able to sleep knowing someone else might try to take it. That deceitful girl! I never would have thought it of her.” “There, there, my dear, don’t distress yourself.” Poirot gently squeezed my arm. “Shall we make ourselves scarce, my friend? I believe our assistance is no longer required.” Once outside, however, he paused, and unexpectedly remarked, “I would like to see the adjacent room.” The door was unlocked, and we entered. The room, a spacious double one, was empty. Dust was visible, and Poirot made a face as he traced a rectangular mark on a table near the window. “The cleanliness here leaves much to be desired,” he commented wryly. As he gazed out the window in deep thought, I grew impatient. “Well?” I prompted. “Why did we come in here?” He started. “I beg your pardon, my friend. I wanted to check if the door was bolted on this side as well.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the door connected to the room we had just left, “it is bolted.” Poirot nodded, lost in thought. “And, in any case,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is closed. I wish you had more opportunities to shine. But even an incompetent inspector like that couldn’t mess up a case like this.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not closed, my friend. It won’t be until we discover who stole the pearls.” “But it was the maid!” “And why do you say that?” “Because,” I stumbled, “they were found hidden in her mattress.” “Tut, tut, tut!” Poirot said impatiently. “Those were not the real pearls.” “What?” “They were fake, my friend.” His revelation left me stunned. Poirot smiled calmly. “The inspector clearly knows nothing about jewels. But soon there will be quite a commotion!” “Let’s go!” I exclaimed, pulling at his arm. “Where?” “We need to inform the Opalsens immediately.” “I don’t think so.” “But what about that poor woman?” “Well, that poor woman, as you refer to her, will rest much easier tonight thinking the jewels are safe.” “But what if the thief escapes with them?” “As usual, you speak without thinking, my friend. How do you know the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked away tonight were not the fake ones, and that the real theft didn’t occur much earlier?” “Oh!” I said, bewildered. “Precisely,” Poirot said, smiling. “We start anew.” He led the way out of the room, paused briefly as if contemplating, and then proceeded to the end of the corridor, stopping outside a small room where the chambermaids and valets from the respective floors gathered. Our chambermaid seemed to be holding court there, recounting her recent experiences to an attentive audience. She halted mid-sentence. Poirot bowed politely as usual.",1
"I arrived home, a place unfamiliar yet strangely familiar. After disembarking the train, we made our way to the hotel, a massive white structure fortified against the onslaught of mosquitoes. Surrounded by wilderness, there was not a road or building in sight. Stepping onto the porch, I couldn't help but gasp in awe. In the distance, just half a mile away, the Falls loomed before us. Never had I witnessed such grandeur and beauty, nor would I ever again. ""Anne, you seem different,"" remarked Suzanne as we sat for lunch. Her gaze lingered on me, filled with curiosity. ""Do I?"" I chuckled, though the sound felt forced. ""I suppose I'm just captivated by it all."" ""It feels like more than that,"" she responded, a hint of concern shadowing her features.",1
"I emerged onto the veranda early the next morning, my gaze fixed on the vast expanse of land stretching towards Johannesburg. The sun cast a soft glow on the towering mounds of earth in the distance, while the distant sound of gunfire echoed in the air. The Revolution still lingered on the horizon. The farmer's wife appeared and beckoned me inside for breakfast, her warm demeanor comforting me. She mentioned that Harry had ventured out at dawn and had yet to return. A sense of unease washed over me once more. What was this invisible barrier that seemed to divide us? Following the meal, I settled on the veranda, a book in hand that remained untouched.",1
"""Get going immediately.” “Dress warmly, sir,” advised the young aviator. “I have a spare coat if you need one.” Poirot glanced at his oversized watch. “Yes, just enough time,” he muttered to himself. Raising his eyes, he courteously nodded to the young officer. “Thank you, sir. However, I am not the one traveling with you. This gentleman here is your passenger.” Stepping aside, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was the second male prisoner who had departed in the other vehicle, and as his face was illuminated, I couldn't help but gasp in surprise.",1
"It's impossible to determine how long the girl has been there, but it's evident she can't be Anne. One must tread lightly when meddling in others' business. If I were the young man, I'd kick Race off the island if he pried into my personal life. Tomorrow, I'm headed to Jo'burg. Race insists I leave soon, as things are deteriorating there. Mrs. Blair was supposed to join me, but she had a change of heart and opted to remain at the Falls.",1
"""Pale complexion and brown eyes, that’s all,” I concluded awkwardly. “And her spouse?” “Just an average man, nothing remarkable.” “Dark or fair?” “Somewhere in between, with an ordinary face.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, there are many men like that. You seem to describe women with more sympathy. Do you know them well? Does Parker have a good relationship with them?” “They are recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t believe” Poirot raised his hand. “Calm down, my friend. Have I implied anything? All I'm saying is that it's an interesting story. And there's nothing to explain it, except maybe the lady's name, right, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said firmly, “but I don’t understand” Poirot cut me off with a hearty laugh. Something amused him greatly. “And Stella means a star, correct? Famous!” “What do you mean?” “And stars provide light! There you go! Relax, Hastings. Don't act so offended. Come, let's go to Montagu Mansions and ask a few questions.” I went with him willingly. The Mansions were a beautiful block of buildings in great condition. A porter in uniform was sitting at the entrance, and Poirot asked him: “Excuse me, do Mr. and Mrs. Robinson live here?” The porter was not very talkative and seemed suspicious. He barely glanced at us and grumbled: “No. 4. Second floor.” “Thank you. Can you tell me how long they've been here?” “Six months.” I was shocked, and noticed Poirot's mischievous grin. “Impossible,” I exclaimed. “You must be mistaken.” “Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s her,” said the porter. “Came in the fall, they did. Exactly six months ago.” He lost interest and walked away. I followed Poirot outside. “Well, Hastings?” my friend asked slyly. “Are you still convinced that charming women always tell the truth?” I stayed silent. Poirot led the way to Brompton Road before I asked him what he was planning and where we were going. “To the real estate agents, Hastings. I want to rent a flat in Montagu Mansions. I think interesting things will happen there soon.” We were lucky. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was available for ten guineas a week. Poirot rented it for a month. Outside again, he silenced my objections: “I make money now! Why can't I fulfill a desire? By the way, Hastings, do you have a gun?” “Yes, somewhere,” I replied, feeling a thrill. “Do you think” “That you'll need it? It's possible. You seem to like the idea. The dramatic and romantic always appeal to you.” The next day we settled into our temporary home. The flat was nicely furnished. It was on the same floor as the Robinsons' but two floors higher. The following Sunday afternoon, Poirot left the front door open and called me urgently as a noise came from below. “Look over the railing. Is that them? Don't let them see you.” I leaned over the staircase. “That's them,” I whispered ungrammatically. “Good. Let's wait.” About half an hour later, a young woman came out in bright clothes. Poirot tiptoed back inside with a satisfied sigh. “That's it. After the owners, the maid. The flat should be empty now.” “What's the plan?” I asked nervously. Poirot had gone into the scullery and was pulling on the coal-lift rope. “We're going to use the dustbin method and descend. No one will notice us. The Sunday concert, the afternoon out, and the nap after the Sunday roast beef dinner all these will keep attention away from Hercule Poirot's actions. Come on, my friend.” He stepped into the makeshift contraption and I followed hesitantly. “Are we breaking into the flat?” I asked uncertainly. Poirot's response was not very reassuring: “Not today,” he said. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly to the second floor. Poirot smiled as he saw that the door to the scullery was open. “You see? They never lock these doors during the day. Anyone could come up or down like we did. At night, yes, but not always then. And that's what we're going to prepare for.” He took out some tools and quickly began working on the bolt so it could be pulled back from the lift. The whole process took about three minutes. Poirot put the tools away and we went back up to our flat. On Monday, Poirot was out all day. When he returned in the evening, he sank into his chair with a satisfied sigh. “Hastings, would you like to hear a story? A tale that will remind you of your favorite movie?” “Go ahead,” I chuckled. “I hope it's a true story, not one of your fantasies.” “It's true. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard can confirm it. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago, some important Naval plans were stolen from an American government office. They revealed crucial Harbor defense positions and would be worth a lot to a foreign government, like Japan's, for example.”",1
"""The initial crime had a unique twist, involving a wealthy lover poised to take over her husband's fortune."" ""Money isn't always the main motive for homicide,"" I interjected. ""Indeed,"" calmly acknowledged Poirot. ""There are two other possibilities, a crime of passion being one. The third, rare motive is murder driven by an ideology that suggests a level of mental instability in the killer. Homicidal mania and religious extremism fall into this category. We can eliminate that possibility in this case."" ""But what about a crime of passion? Could that be a factor here? If Madame Daubreuil was involved with Renauld, and his feelings for her waned, or if jealousy came into play, is it not conceivable that she might have lashed out in a fit of rage?"" Poirot shook his head.",1
"A lovely scene greeted us: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother's proud dark head inclined over the fair-haired youngsters. Lord Yardly was close by, smiling down at them. ""Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,"" the butler declared. Lady Yardly looked up in surprise, her husband hesitated before approaching, his gaze seeking guidance from Poirot. The detective rose to the occasion. ""My apologies! I am still investigating the case of Miss Marvell. She is due to visit you on Friday, correct? I am conducting a preliminary inspection to ensure all is in order.""",1
"Colonel Race stood up. “Good morning Lucas,” he greeted. Harry blushed deeply for some unknown reason. “Yes,” I interjected cheerfully, “you should go by your true name now.” However, Harry remained fixated on Colonel Race. “So you recognize me, sir,” he eventually spoke. “I never forget a face. I saw you once when I was a boy.” “What is going on here?” I inquired, confused, glancing back and forth between them. It appeared to be a battle of determination between the two. Race emerged victorious. Harry turned away slightly. “I guess you're right, sir. Go ahead and tell her my real name.” “Anne, this man is not Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas died in the War.""",1
"""He appeared on the verge of speaking, but then thought better of it. Leaning over, he picked up a spade nearby. “This is the tool that dug the grave,” Giraud remarked. “But it won’t provide any leads. It belonged to Renauld, and the person who used it wore gloves. Look, here they are.” He gestured with his foot towards two dirty, earth-stained gloves. “They belonged to Renauld or his gardener. The perpetrators of this crime left nothing to chance. The victim was stabbed with his own dagger and was meant to be buried with his own spade. They were meticulous, but I will outsmart them. There’s always a clue to be found.” Poirot, however, seemed more intrigued by a piece of discolored lead-piping next to the spade. He delicately touched it. “Is this also linked to the victim?” he inquired, his tone tinged with irony. Giraud shrugged, showing indifference. “It could have been here for weeks. It doesn’t interest me.” “On the contrary, I find it quite fascinating,” Poirot replied sweetly. I suspected he was simply trying to rile up the Paris detective, and it worked. Annoyed, Giraud turned away and resumed his search. Meanwhile, Poirot, struck by an idea, stepped back and tested the door of a small shed. “It’s locked,” Giraud called out. “Just where the gardener stores his junk. The spade didn’t come from there, but from the toolshed by the house.” “Incredible,” M. Bex whispered to me excitedly. “He’s only been here for thirty minutes, and he already knows everything! What a remarkable man! Undoubtedly, Giraud is the finest detective of our time.” Despite my dislike for the detective, I couldn't help but be impressed by his efficiency. Poirot, on the other hand, seemed to be focusing on trivial details unrelated to the case. At one point, he even asked about a whitewashed line encircling the grave, a golf course feature. Poirot was unfamiliar with the game but found the tee boxes to be the only symmetrical aspect.",1
"He claimed he went directly to the club, which if confirmed, would mean he couldn't have been the one who shot his uncle at nine o’clock with a black beard. Japp mentioned the suspiciously fast growth of the beard on the real culprit, suggesting they may be among Mr. Pace’s American associates. After questioning the housekeeper and her mistress, their stories aligned, pointing the investigation towards the Americans.",1
"""The crowd needs to make some space. I couldn't bear the sight and made a quick escape towards the elevator. Fresh air was all I needed. The doctor, who had just finished examining the body, was rushing ahead. In his haste, a piece of paper slipped from his grasp. I paused, retrieved it, and chased after him. Unfortunately, the lift doors closed before I could catch up, leaving me with the paper in hand.""",1
"“Sir Laurence’s next of kin? Do you know, Race?” “Yes,” he replied. “I am.” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) After the Fancy Dress dance, I felt the need to confide in someone. Up until then, I had tackled everything alone and enjoyed it. But now, things had changed. Doubt clouded my judgment, and loneliness seeped in for the first time. I sat on my bunk in my gipsy dress, pondering. Colonel Race came to mind first. He appeared to like me and I trusted him to be kind. Yet, hesitations arose. His strong personality might take control of my mystery. Mrs. Blair, on the other hand, seemed kind as well. Though I knew it might be a fleeting kindness, I could captivate her with my story. Her genuine nature appealed to me. I made up my mind to seek her out immediately. After learning her cabin number from the steward, I headed to cabin No. 71, where I found Mrs. Blair in a beautiful kimono. I divulged my story to her, and she, instead of reacting as I had anticipated, marveled at my adventurous spirit. Our conversation led to the discovery of links between Sir Eustace and the mysterious events, including the murdered woman in his house and the stabbed secretary. Suzanne, as she insisted on being called, also mentioned the puzzling case of the stewardess, whose face seemed oddly familiar to me.",1
"""I stood outside, waiting patiently, but they never emerged. Eventually, I decided to enter. To my surprise, the shop was deserted! There had to be another exit.” I fixed my gaze on him. “Continuing on, I returned to the hotel and began to inquire about Miss Pettigrew.” Pagett's voice dropped to a whisper, his breath heavy with secrecy. “Sir Eustace, a witness reported a man leaving her room last night.” My eyebrows shot up. “I had always believed her to be a woman of impeccable reputation,” I remarked softly. Pagett continued, oblivious to my comment. “I proceeded directly to her room and conducted a thorough search.""",1
"""Did those four men commit any act that might show disrespect to Men-her-Ra?"" Poirot asked, looking at the doctor. ""You've been fooled if you believe all that nonsense,"" the doctor replied. ""I am a man of science, and I only believe in what science teaches."" Poirot, with his green cat's eyes, remained calm. ""Do the native workers have any thoughts on the matter?"" Poirot inquired. ""I suppose they are also getting scared,"" the doctor admitted. Poirot showed them a book titled The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans before leaving the tent. Later, Poirot spoke to Mr. Harper about Mr. Bleibner's nephew and his sudden appearance. Mr. Harper mentioned the heated argument between the nephew and Mr. Bleibner, who refused to give him any money. The nephew left for Cairo immediately. Mr. Harper also revealed that Mr. Bleibner had not left a will. As the conversation continued, Mr. Harper expressed his intention to leave the expedition for New York, fearing for his safety. Poirot, with a mysterious smile, reminded him that ""he got one of his victims in New York."" The young man was visibly nervous. Poirot remarked that he was on the edge, but did not elaborate further. Later, Poirot, Sir Guy Willard, and Dr. Tosswill were shown around the excavations. The atmosphere was tense, with a feeling of menace lingering in the air. Hassan, the late Sir John Willard's servant, warned Poirot to leave, citing evil spirits. The meal was somber, with Dr. Tosswill discussing Egyptian antiquities. Before retiring for the night, a shadowy figure resembling Anubis was spotted moving amidst the tents. Poirot and the others tried to find the figure but were unsuccessful. They returned to find Poirot taking precautions for his safety in his own unique way.",1
"""Giraud is in agreement with me, is he not, sir?"" Regardless of Giraud's true beliefs, he assumed the position with no visible reaction. Coolly and almost disdainfully, he stated: ""Indeed, I concur."" The sound of surprise and curiosity erupted once more. ""But what a notion!"" exclaimed Mr. Hautet. ""To stab a man after he's deceased! Savage! Unprecedented! Perhaps out of insatiable hatred."" ""No, Mr. Judge,"" remarked Poirot. ""I would venture to say it was executed quite calculatedly to make an impact."" ""What kind of impact?"" ""The impact it very nearly achieved,"" responded Poirot enigmatically. Mr. Bex had been contemplating. ""So, how was the man murdered?"" ""He was not murdered. He perished.""",1
"In a mysterious twist of fate, I found myself in grave danger, a target of unknown forces desperate to eliminate me. The key to their motives lay in a piece of knowledge connected to valuable diamonds. I was certain that one individual, Harry Rayburn, held the answers I sought. However, he had disappeared into the shadows, evading capture. The likelihood of our paths crossing again was slim. I forced myself to focus on the present reality, pushing aside any sentimental thoughts of Harry Rayburn.",1
"""His name is John Eardsley,"" Colonel Race announced before turning and walking away. I watched him go, lost in thought. Harry's voice brought me back to reality. ""Anne, please forgive me,"" he pleaded, reaching for my hand. I hesitated before pulling away. ""Why did you lie to me?"" Harry struggled to explain, ""I was scared of the influence of money and power. I just wanted you to love me for who I am, not for what I have.""",1
"""Then, they shall triumphantly return to the god.’ A peculiar coincidence exists at the moment with a stone closely resembling this one, known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It belongs to the renowned film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. An intriguing comparison of the two stones could be made.” She paused. “Impressive!” murmured Poirot. “Undoubtedly a tale of the highest order.” He addressed Mary Marvell. “And you are not fearful, madame? You have no superstitious fears? You do not dread introducing these two Siamese twins to each other in case a Chinaman should appear and, presto! spirit them both back to China?” His tone was mocking, yet I sensed a hint of seriousness underneath. “I do not believe Lady Yardly’s diamond comes close to the quality of mine,” Miss Marvell remarked. “Regardless, I intend to find out.” What more Poirot might have said remains unknown, as at that moment the door burst open, and a magnificent man entered the room. From his neatly curled black hair to his patent-leather boots, he was a hero suited for a romance. “I promised to come by for you, Mary,” Gregory Rolf stated, “and here I am. So, what does Monsieur Poirot think of our little predicament? Just a big hoax, like I do?” Poirot smiled at the imposing actor. They presented a ludicrous contrast. “Hoax or not, Mr. Rolf,” he dryly remarked, “I have advised your wife not to take the jewel to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I agree with you, sir. I have already told Mary the same. But there she goes! She’s all woman, and I suppose she can’t stand the thought of another woman outshining her in the jewelry department.” “What nonsense, Gregory!” Mary Marvell retorted sharply. But she blushed in anger. Poirot shrugged. “Madame, I have given my advice. That is all I can do. It is finished.” He escorted them to the door. “Ah, well,” he said upon his return. “Women’s stories! The good husband certainly hit the nail on the head, although he was not tactful! Definitely not.” I shared my vague recollections with him, and he nodded vigorously. “That’s what I thought. Nevertheless, there is something peculiar underlying all of this. With your permission, my friend, I will take a stroll. Please wait for my return. I will not be gone long.” I was dozing in my chair when the landlady knocked on the door and peeked in. “There’s another lady here to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I told her he was out, but she insists on waiting, as she has come up from the countryside.” “Oh, bring her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can assist her in some way.” In a moment, the lady was brought in. My heart skipped a beat as I recognized her. Lady Yardly had been featured too many times in the Society papers to remain anonymous. “Please, have a seat, Lady Yardly,” I said, pulling up a chair.",1
"‘Is it possible for a man to shoot himself like this? Show me,’ she demands eagerly. He obliges, putting the rifle's barrel in his mouth. She kneels, her finger on the trigger, a mischievous smile on her face. ‘Well, sir,’ she teases, ‘what if I were to pull this trigger?’ “And then, my dear Hastings, she does just that!” In all of Poirot’s cases I've chronicled, his inquiries begin with a central fact, be it murder or theft, and follow a path of logical deduction to the ultimate, satisfying resolution.",1
"""No need to be upset, Anne. I was just joking around. Come sit here. In all seriousness, I believe you've stumbled upon something crucial. Previously, we assumed Pagett had an alibi. But now we know he doesn't."" ""Exactly,"" I replied. ""We need to keep a close watch on him."" ""And on everyone else too,"" she added with a hint of regret. ""Actually, that's one of the topics I wanted to discuss with you. That, and our finances. Please, don't act so haughty. I understand you value your pride and independence, but you need to consider reason in this matter.""",1
"""Your expression tells me that a close relative is being buried today,"" Pagett disregarded the comment. ""I thought you wouldn't know about this,"" he pointed to the telegram. ""I know you hate early mornings, but it's already nine o'clock,"" Pagett considered 9 a.m. as midday ""and I thought that given the circumstances,"" he tapped the telegram again. ""What's that?"" I inquired. ""A telegram from the Marlow police. A woman was killed in your home,"" that got my attention. ""How audacious,"" I exclaimed. ""In my house? Who killed her?"" ""They didn't say. Should we return to England immediately, Sir Eustace?"" ""There's no need to assume that. Why should we go back?"" ""The police-"" ""What concern do I have with the police?"" ""It was your house."" ""Seems more like my misfortune than my fault,"" I replied. Guy Pagett shook his head sadly. ""It'll have a negative impact on the voters,"" he said mournfully. I fail to see why, but Pagett's instincts are usually correct in such matters. On the surface, a Member of Parliament's efficiency shouldn't be affected by a woman being murdered in his empty house, but the public's perception is unpredictable. ""She's a foreigner too, which makes it worse,"" Pagett added gloomily. Once again, he may be right. ""I hope this won't upset Caroline,"" I worried aloud. Caroline is the cook in my employ, and the wife of my gardener. She's an excellent cook, although James isn't a great gardener. ""I doubt she'll stay after this,"" Pagett remarked. ""You're always so cheerful,"" I remarked dryly. I might have to return to England. Pagett seems to expect it. And Caroline will need to be reassured. Just three days later. It's beyond me why anyone would stay in England during winter! The climate is dreadful. This situation is extremely frustrating. The house agents say it will be nearly impossible to rent out the Mill House after all this attention. Caroline has been placated with a raise. We could have just sent her a message from Cannes. As I suspected from the start, there was no reason for us to come over. I'll return tomorrow. One day later. Several unexpected events have taken place. To start, I ran into Augustus Milray, a prime example of government incompetence. He spoke in hushed tones of secrecy as he pulled me aside in the Club. He had a lot to say.",1
"""Has there been any history of tetanus outbreaks in the area?""  ""Not a single one.""  ""Can you confirm that Mr. Bleibner's passing was not caused by tetanus?""  ""Completely sure. He had a small cut on his thumb that got infected, leading to septicemia. It may seem similar to the untrained eye, but they are distinct conditions.""  ""So we have a total of four deaths, each from different causes - cardiac arrest, blood poisoning, suicide, and tetanus.""  ""That's correct, Monsieur Poirot.""",1
"I had a vision, a horrifying vision, of her being in grave danger. I quickly rose from my bed and hurried to her room, my mind filled with concern. To my dismay, she was nowhere to be found, and her bed remained undisturbed. Her eyes pleaded with me for guidance. ""What do you suggest, Sir Eustace?"" Resisting the urge to simply tell her to go back to bed and not fret over nothing, I pondered the situation. ""What is Race's opinion on this matter?"" Race shouldn't get to call all the shots. Let him experience both the pros and cons of female company. ""I have searched everywhere for him.""",1
"In a matter of moments, I caught a glimpse of her eyes slyly watching me from above. Despite my efforts, a smile crept onto my face, prompting her to quickly set the paper aside and erupt into a cheerful laughter. ""I knew you weren't as foolish as you appeared,"" she exclaimed. Her laughter was so contagious that I couldn't resist joining in, even though I didn't appreciate being called a ""fool."" The girl embodied everything I despised, but that didn't mean I had to act foolishly. I decided to relax. After all, she was undeniably attractive... ""There! Now we're pals!"" announced the mischievous girl.",1
"""Would you prefer if I dressed you up? Because I'd rather rip those clothes off you. You're not leaving me, do you understand? You belong to me. If I let you walk away, I might lose you forever. I never feel secure with you. Tonight, you're coming with me, no matter what anyone else thinks."" He embraced me tightly, kissing me until I struggled for air. ""I can't bear to be without you any longer, Anne. I despise all this money. Let Race take it. Come with me. Let's go."" ""What about my toothbrush?"" I hesitated. ""You can pick one up. I know I sound crazy, but please, come with me!"" He stormed off angrily, setting a brisk pace.",1
"""Japp always had a way of surprising me with his antics, causing a chuckle to escape my lips. Meanwhile, Poirot remained calm as he perused his letters. 'An invitation to speak to the boy scouts. A request from the Countess of Forfanock to pay her a visit. Likely another pampered lap-dog,' he muttered. Suddenly, Poirot's demeanor shifted as he focused intently on one particular letter. Without hesitation, he passed it to me. 'This is quite unusual, my friend. Take a look for yourself,' he urged.""",1
"I found a wallet containing a few bills and a couple of unimportant letters, along with a roll of film that I misplaced later on. Additionally, there was a note with an appointment set for the 22nd aboard the Kilmorden Castle. In my rush to leave without attracting attention, I accidentally dropped the note, but luckily I memorized the details. After quickly removing my disguise in the nearest cloak-room, I made my way back to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still enjoying her lunch. I won't go into specifics about how I tailed her to Marlow.",1
"Because honeymoons are fleeting, Anne. So I can confidently state that without fear of your outburst. Love in the wild will endure, but eventually you'll yearn for luxury, fashion, and opulence. Enjoy your honeymoon, dear lunatics, make it last.",1
"“Then, of course, we need to determine our current situation. What was the timing of Mr. Schneider’s demise?” “Three days back.” “You are confident it was tetanus?” “Absolutely.” “There’s no possibility it was strychnine poisoning, correct?” “No doubt about it. It was definitely tetanus.” “Were you able to administer the anti-serum?” “Yes, we did,” replied the doctor sarcastically. “We exhausted all options.” “Did you have the anti-serum on hand?” “No. We obtained it from Cairo.",1
"With Madame Daubreuil's story in mind, she willingly allows herself to be silenced and tied up. So, Poirot, what are your thoughts on that?” I sat back, feeling a sense of accomplishment in my reconstruction. Poirot studied me for a moment. “You have a knack for storytelling, my friend,” he finally said. “Perhaps you should consider writing for the cinema.” “You think so?” “It would certainly make for an interesting movie, the tale you've just shared with me, although it lacks realism.” “I may have left out some details, but…” “You haven't just left them out you have skillfully disregarded them.”",1
"“So he anticipated his own demise? That throws a wrench in our assumptions! But please, step inside.” He gestured towards the gate, ushering us towards the house. As we walked, M. Bex filled the silence: “The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, needs to be informed immediately. He just wrapped up his investigation of the crime scene and is gearing up for interrogations. A delightful man. You’ll find him quite personable. Unconventional in his approach, but a skilled adjudicator.” Poirot inquired, “When did the crime take place?” “The body was found this morning around nine o’clock. Testimonies from Madame Renauld and the medical experts suggest the death occurred around 2 a.",1
"""The lady is indeed young and beautiful,"" remarked the commissary. ""But the key question remains, did you remember to lock the door when you left?"" I hesitated before answering slowly, ""I blame myself terribly for forgetting to relock the door. It was only after returning to the Villa that I realized my mistake."" The commissary paused, pondering the implications. ""For twenty minutes at least,"" he murmured. ""Exactly,"" I confirmed. ""Twenty minutes,"" he repeated. Suddenly, Giraud interjected, ""You find it deplorable, M. le juge?"" The magistrate agreed, but Giraud saw it differently, ""I find it admirable."" His unexpected perspective intrigued me. ""Admirable, M. Giraud?"" I inquired. ""Yes, because it indicates that the assassin, or an accomplice, was near the Villa recently. We may soon apprehend them,"" Giraud declared confidently. Poirot turned to me, seeking confirmation about fingerprints. Giraud suggested that gloves might have been worn to avoid leaving prints. Poirot disagreed, stating that the assassin must have been certain there were no fingerprints. As the discussion continued, the magistrate prepared to leave, expressing confidence in Giraud's abilities. Poirot and I followed suit, with Poirot pausing to measure an overcoat before we departed. As we walked, I sought to unravel the mysteries surrounding Mrs. Renauld's involvement in the case. Poirot acknowledged the complexity of the situation, hinting at hidden motives and secrets that had yet to be uncovered. The conversation turned to the timing of the crime, with Poirot revealing a crucial discrepancy that could change the course of the investigation. I was eager to pursue this new lead, but Poirot cautioned against rushing to conclusions. The truth, he hinted, was more elusive than it seemed. And so, the mystery deepened, with each revelation leading us closer to the heart of the enigma.""",1
"""May I inquire about the departure time of the final train from Merlinville station?"" Poirot questioned. ""It departs at eleven-fifty going one direction, and at 12:17 going the other way. However, it is more plausible that they arranged for a motor vehicle instead."" Poirot nodded in understanding. ""Yes, that is a possibility worth investigating further,"" remarked the magistrate, his optimism returning. ""A motor carrying two foreigners would likely attract attention. Well noted, M. Bex."" With a satisfied grin, the magistrate turned to Mrs. Renauld and posed another query.",1
"Later that evening, I overheard a different conversation. A harsh voice rang out, ""I must say, she is quite stunning."" The harsh reality of life struck me once again. Men only show kindness to those they find attractive, while women are equally judgmental towards those who are. I sighed deeply as I began to style my hair. It's one of my better features, jet black and thick, framing my face elegantly. I brushed it back with determination, as it seems that ears are no longer in fashion. Mrs. Flemming's gaze lingered on my ears, offering a rare moment of kindness. Mr. Flemming, however, appeared puzzled by my new look. The day went by smoothly, with plans for me to start looking for work immediately. That night, I scrutinized my reflection in the mirror. Was I truly beautiful? I couldn't say for certain. My features weren't conventionally pretty, lacking a perfect nose or lips. A curate once compared my eyes to ""imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood,"" but I took it with a grain of salt. I decided to embrace my unconventional beauty, wrapping myself in black fabric and accentuating my features with makeup. The transformation into ""Anna the Adventuress"" delighted me. In the following weeks, I found myself growing bored with Mrs. Flemming and her mundane circle. Their conversations revolved around trivial matters, from the quality of milk to the struggles of finding good servants. Their lack of interest in the world outside their bubble left me feeling disconnected. Despite their wealth, I found their lives utterly unremarkable.",1
"He never mentioned that I had graduated, nor my B.Sc. His health had been deteriorating for the past three years, and he passed away a month ago. ""I am getting to the reason for my visit. My uncle left behind a very peculiar will. According to it, Crabtree Manor and all its belongings are under my control for a year after his death ‘during which time my smart niece can showcase her intelligence,’ to quote the exact words. At the end of that period, ‘my intelligence proving superior to hers,’ the estate and my uncle’s substantial wealth will be donated to various charities."" ""That seems quite harsh on you, mademoiselle, considering you were Mr. Marsh’s sole blood relative."" ""I do not see it that way. Uncle Andrew gave me fair warning, and I made my own choices. Since I did not comply with his desires, he was well within his rights to leave his money to whoever he pleased."" ""Was the will prepared by a lawyer?"" ""No; it was written on a standard will-form and witnessed by the couple who reside in the house and took care of my uncle."" ""Is there a chance of contesting such a will?"" ""I would not even consider attempting it."" ""So you view it as a challenge from your uncle?"" ""Precisely how I perceive it."" ""It does seem to carry that interpretation,"" Poirot mused. ""Somewhere within this sprawling old manor, your uncle has hidden either a sum of money in cash or perhaps a second will, and has given you a year to demonstrate your cleverness in finding it."" ""Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am assuming that your cleverness surpasses mine."" ""Ah, ah! That is very gracious of you. My gray cells are at your service. Have you conducted any searches yourself?"" ""Only a brief one; but I hold my uncle’s unquestionable skills in high regard, and do not believe the task will be simple."" ""Do you have the will or a copy of it on you?"" Miss Marsh handed over a document. Poirot examined it, nodding in agreement. ""Dated three years ago. Stamped March 25; and the time is also noted at 11 a.m. that is quite telling. It limits the scope of the search. Undoubtedly, we must look for another will. A will made even thirty minutes later would nullify this one. Well, mademoiselle, you have presented me with a delightful and clever puzzle. I am eager to solve it for you. While your uncle was undoubtedly talented, his gray cells cannot compare to Hercule Poirot’s!"" (Truly, Poirot’s conceit knows no bounds!) ""Fortunately, I am currently unoccupied. Hastings and I will head to Crabtree Manor tonight. The caretaker couple who looked after your uncle are still there, correct?"" ""Yes, their surname is Baker."" The next day marked the beginning of our official search. We had arrived late the previous night. Mr.",1
"Poirot's brows furrowed as he pondered the new evidence that had come to light. ""There is something troubling about this situation,"" I whispered. He dismissed my concerns with a wave of his hand and posed a question: ""Excuse me, Monsieur Bex, but was it possible for M. Renauld to have driven the car himself?"" The commissary glanced at Françoise, who replied promptly: ""No, Monsieur never drove himself."" Poirot's expression darkened. ""Please, do enlighten me about your worries,"" I urged impatiently. ""Do you not see? In his letter, M. Renauld mentions sending the car to Calais to fetch me."" ""Maybe he meant to hire a car,"" I suggested. ""Certainly, that is a possibility. But why hire a car when he had his own? And why dismiss the chauffeur suddenly, without any notice, just before our arrival? Could it be that he wanted him out of the way for a specific reason?"" Françoise had left the room. The magistrate drummed his fingers thoughtfully on the table. ""Monsieur Bex,"" he spoke up after a while, ""we are faced with conflicting testimonies. Whom should we trust, Françoise or Denise?"" ""Denise,"" the commissary stated firmly. ""She was the one who let the visitor in. Françoise is old and stubborn, and seems to have taken a disliking to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our investigations indicate that Renauld was involved with another woman."" ""Ah!"" exclaimed M. Hautet. ""We forgot to mention that to M. Poirot."" He rummaged through the papers on the table and handed a particular one to Poirot. ""This letter, M. Poirot, was found in the pocket of the deceased's coat."" Poirot accepted the letter and unfolded it. It was worn and written in English, with a rather unsteady hand: ""My dearest one: Why have you not written in so long? Do you still love me? Your recent letters have been distant and strange, and now this silence. It frightens me. If you were to stop loving me! But that's impossible, what a foolish thought I am always having! But if you were to stop loving me, I don't know what I would do, perhaps end my life! I cannot imagine living without you. Sometimes I suspect another woman is coming between us. Let her be warned, and you too! I would rather harm you than let her have you! I mean it. ""But, I am writing nonsense. You love me, and I love you yes, love you, love you, love you! ""Yours always, ""BELLA."" The letter had no address or date. Poirot returned it with a serious expression. ""And what is your interpretation, Monsieur le juge?"" The magistrate shrugged. ""It is clear that M. Renauld was involved with this Englishwoman, Bella. He meets Madame Daubreuil here and begins an affair with her. He then distances himself from Bella, who immediately becomes suspicious. This letter contains a direct threat. Initially, the case seemed straightforward jealousy! The fact that Renauld was stabbed in the back suggested a crime of passion, likely committed by a woman."" Poirot nodded. ""The backstab, yes but not the grave! That was a laborious task, too difficult for a woman monsieur. A man must have dug that grave."" The commissary exclaimed: ""You are right. We overlooked that detail."" ""As I was saying,"" continued M. Hautet, ""initially, the case appeared simple. However, the masked men and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here, we have a different scenario, seemingly unrelated to the first. Regarding the letter you received, do you think it could be related to this 'Bella' and her threats?"" Poirot shook his head. ""Unlikely. A man like M. Renauld, with a history of adventures in distant lands, would not seek protection from a woman."" The magistrate agreed. ""Exactly my thoughts. We must, then, seek an explanation for the letter "" ""In Santiago,"" the commissary concluded. ""I will send a cable immediately to the authorities in that city, requesting detailed information on the deceased's life there, his romantic affairs, business dealings, friendships, and any enemies he may have had. It would be surprising if we do not uncover a lead to his mysterious murder."" The commissary looked around for confirmation. ""Excellent,"" Poirot remarked approvingly. ""His wife might also provide valuable insight,"" added the magistrate. ""Have you found any other letters from this Bella among M. Renauld's belongings?"" Poirot inquired. ""No. One of our initial steps was to search his private papers in the study. However, we found nothing noteworthy. Everything seemed in order, except for his will. Here it is."" Poirot perused the document. ""I see. A thousand-pound legacy to Mr. Stonor who is he, by the way?"" ""M. Renauld's secretary. He stayed in England but visited here occasionally for weekends."" ""And everything else bequeathed unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise. Simply written, yet legally binding. Witnessed by the two servants, Denise and Françoise. Nothing particularly unusual about that."" He returned the document. ""Perhaps,"" Bex began, ""you did not notice "" ""The date?"" Poirot interjected. ""Oh, but I did. Two weeks ago. It might indicate an early warning of impending danger. Many wealthy individuals die without a will, not considering the possibility of their demise. However, it is premature to draw conclusions. Nevertheless, it suggests a genuine affection for his wife, despite his extramarital affairs."" ""Indeed,"" M. Hautet mused. ""But it may disadvantage his son, as he is entirely reliant on his mother. If she were to remarry, and her new husband gained control, the boy might never inherit a cent of his father's fortune.""",1
"I thought I was being clever. I followed him through the portières. I had a hard time with Suzanne. She argued and pleaded, but in the end, I got my way. She promised to follow my instructions and bid me farewell at the station. The next morning, I arrived at my destination and was met by a Dutchman. He had a car waiting, and we drove off. The sound of guns in the distance indicated fighting in Jo’burg. Our objective was in the suburbs, and we made several detours to get there. We stopped before a ramshackle building, and I was led inside to see Mr. Harry Rayburn. The room was sparsely furnished, and he recognized me as Miss Beddingfeld. We had a conversation, and he mentioned my resemblance to two other characters. I remarked on his exceptional make-up skills and our discussion turned to business. I insisted on speaking with Sir Eustace Pedler, which surprised him. He left abruptly and returned in a more composed manner. He led me to Sir Eustace's room, where I was greeted warmly. We discussed my knowledge of his true identity as the 'Colonel'. Sir Eustace explained a situation involving Mr. Pagett and expressed regret at a mistake that had been made.",1
"“Should I take this house?” I inquired, glancing around the empty rooms.  The old woman shook her head. “Not a chance, dear. This place has a dark past.”  My curiosity piqued, I pressed for details.",1

"""Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?” And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr. Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.” “What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.” I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality. I introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.",1
"""I gazed at him in disbelief as he exclaimed: ""Come on now, surely you don't buy into all that nonsense about masked men and the rest of that story!"" His words caught me off guard, leaving me unsure of how to respond. With a calm demeanor, he continued: ""You heard me tell Giraud, didn't you, that every aspect of this crime seems all too familiar to me? Well, that leads to one of two possibilities - either the mastermind behind the original crime is also behind this one, or our killer's memory was triggered by details from a well-known case. I will be able to confirm which it is once "" he trailed off. Lost in thought, I pondered various scenarios.""",1
"""Hautet, eager to display his superior knowledge, quickly relayed the story of the mysterious visitor from the night before, mentioning the cheque made out to “Duveen” and the letter signed “Bella.” Giraud attentively listened, studying the letter before returning it. “All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unchanged.” “And what is your theory?” “I would rather not say at this moment. I have just begun my investigations.” “One question, M. Giraud,” Poirot interjected. “Your theory accounts for the door being opened, but why was it left open? Wouldn't it have been more natural for them to close it behind them to avoid being caught by a passing sergent de ville?” “They simply forgot. A mistake, I admit.” Poirot disagreed, stating firmly, “The door being left open was intentional or necessary. Any theory that neglects this fact will be futile.” We were all surprised by Poirot's confidence, especially after his recent mistake with the match end. The detective, seemingly amused, challenged Poirot to share his thoughts on the case. “What stands out to you the most?” Poirot asked. “Does anything seem familiar about this case, M. Giraud? Does it remind you of anything?” Giraud couldn't recall anything familiar. “You are mistaken,” Poirot calmly responded. “A very similar crime has been committed in the past.” Giraud was skeptical. “When and where?” “I cannot recall at the moment, but I will. Perhaps you can help me.” Poirot explained the importance of individual criminal methods and the resemblance between crimes committed by the same individual. ""Man is unoriginal, both within and outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any subsequent crimes will closely resemble it.""",1
"“Lies, all lies!” Madame Daubreuil exclaimed, her voice trembling with fear. Giraud cut her off with a cold stare. “No accusations yet, just answer my questions,” he said sternly. “I will tell you anything you want to know,” she replied. Peering down at the lifeless body, Madame Daubreuil shook her head. “I have never seen him before.” Giraud let her go, but kept her under close watch. As he continued his investigation, he muttered to himself, “Is he Spanish, perhaps?” I studied the face and replied, “No, definitely French.” Giraud grunted in frustration. Baffled and perplexed, he meticulously searched every inch of the shed. Suddenly, the examining magistrate burst in, followed by his clerk, M. Bex, and the doctor. “Another crime!” the magistrate exclaimed. Giraud turned to him confidently, “I will solve it.” The doctor knelt by the body, while the magistrate pondered, “Could it be one of the assassins?” Giraud shook his head decisively, “He is French, I am certain of that.” The doctor, looking puzzled, interjected, “Killed yesterday morning, you say?” Giraud nodded, “Yes, with the stolen dagger.”",1
"Despite the obstacles I faced, I found myself tangled in a web of new challenges. With no way to reach the girl, it was crucial that she understood my plan of defense, which I was ready to execute. While she could attempt to communicate with me, the risk of Poirot intercepting the message was too great. Her best option was to vanish completely for the time being.",1
"""Today, Schneider mentioned. Bleibner headed to Cairo immediately."" ""Was he healthy then?"" ""The young one?"" ""He did mention an issue, but not serious."" ""Did Bleibner have a will?"" ""Not that we know of."" ""Staying with the expedition?"" ""No, off to New York once things are settled.""",1
"""It might be beneficial if I was acquainted with the name of my new secretary,"" I sarcastically remarked. He paused for a moment. ""Harry Rayburn appears to be a fitting choice,"" he remarked. It was an interesting way of phrasing it. ""Agreed,"" I stated once more. (Anne’s Narrative Continued) It is rather embarrassing for a protagonist to suffer from sea-sickness. In stories, the rougher the sea, the more she enjoys it. While everyone else is unwell, she perseveres on the deck, facing the elements and actually reveling in the storm.",1
"Lowen had no idea that the safe would be left unattended. He was there for a job interview. It was unexpected that Mr. Davenheim would be away. ""He might have taken advantage,"" I proposed. ""But how could he break into the safe without the proper tools?"" ""What about his grudge against Davenheim?"" I questioned. ""It seems more likely that Davenheim had a grudge against him,"" was the response. ""And what about his lie about never leaving the study?"" ""He may have been scared,"" they explained. ""The missing man's clothes had just been found in the lake."" ""But what about Kellett's story?"" I pressed. ""If it's true, Lowen is definitely involved."" ""But you've missed the most important points,"" they revealed. ""Davenheim's obsession with jewelry and his trip to Buenos Ayres."" The telegram arrived the next day with a crucial piece of information: ""‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’” Poirot exclaimed, ""All is solved!"" I was puzzled. ""Why should I withdraw my money from Davenheim and Salmon?"" Poirot warned of an impending financial disaster. The next day, the headlines confirmed his prediction of the Davenheim bank's collapse.",1
"""In the small town, there wasn't a soul who appeared capable of defeating an enemy, whether through one powerful strike or multiple.

""Is there any proof that Madame Renauld was in love with the vagrant?"" ""No, but..."" ""Then let go of hypotheses that lack supporting evidence. Instead, ponder on who Madame Renauld truly loved.""

This marks, if memory serves, the third confrontation.” “You speak true,” Harry acknowledged. “This marks the third confrontation. I have been bested by you on two occasions. Have you not heard that fortune favors the bold on the third attempt? This time is mine, Anne.” I stood poised, prepared for action.",1
"Poirot pondered for a moment before speaking. ""The situation is quite intriguing, indeed. Hand me my calendar, Hastings,"" he requested. I obliged, passing the small book to him. ""Let's see,"" Poirot muttered as he flipped through the pages. ""Ah, the full moon is scheduled for Friday next. In three days' time, to be precise. My advice to you, madame, is to entrust the diamond to my care until after that date. We can then decide on our next course of action accordingly.""",1
"""So, after the mess we made, wouldn't it be best to leave now?"" ""But what about the dinner prepared by Lord Yardly's chef?"" ""Who cares about dinner!"" I exclaimed. Poirot looked horrified.

""The second diamond,"" I whispered. ""Miss Marvell's."" ""And?"" ""Can't you see?"" I was frustrated by his lack of understanding.",1

"Suzanne and I spent our time collecting small trinkets, each one different and full of character. Despite Sir Eustace's attempts to stop us, we continued our adventure on the South African trains. As we discussed the mystery surrounding Guy Pagett, I couldn't shake off my suspicions. However, Suzanne's belief in his innocence made me question my own judgment. The night Pagett tried to harm me on the Kilmorden, his explanation didn't quite add up. I couldn't ignore the facts, despite Suzanne's insistence on his honesty. We debated his guilt, while also pondering the identity of the mysterious woman killed in Marlow.

So, my dear friend, direct me in any way you desire. We both know a thing or two, don't we?"" And chuckling heartily, delighted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bid us farewell. I regret to report that Poirot's initial comment to me as we walked along the corridor was: ""A famous old imbecile, that one! So stupid it's pitiful!"" Just as we were exiting the building, we encountered Giraud, looking more dapper than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. ""Aha! M. Poirot,"" he exclaimed breezily. ""You have returned from England then?"" ""As you can see,"" replied Poirot. ""The conclusion of the case is not far now, I believe."" ""I concur with you, M. Giraud."" Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His dejected demeanor seemed to amuse the other. ""Of all the wishy-washy criminals! Not a clue about defending himself. It's unbelievable!"" ""So unbelievable that it prompts one to think, doesn't it?"" suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud wasn't even paying attention. He twirled his cane amiably. ""Well, good day, M. Poirot. I'm pleased you're finally convinced of young Renauld's guilt."" ""Excuse me! But I am not at all convinced. Jack Renauld is innocent."" Giraud stared for a moment then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: ""Toqué!"" Poirot straightened up. A dangerous glint appeared in his eyes. ""M. Giraud, throughout this case your attitude towards me has been intentionally insulting! You need a lesson. I am willing to bet you 500 francs that I find M. Renauld's murderer before you do. Do we have a deal?"" Giraud stared helplessly at him, and muttered again: ""Toqué!"" ""Come now,"" urged Poirot, ""do we have a deal?"" ""I have no desire to take your money."" ""Rest assured you won't!"" ""Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner towards you being insulting. Well, once or twice, your manner has irked me."" ""I am delighted to hear it,"" said Poirot. ""Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings."" I said nothing as we strolled along the street. My heart felt heavy. Poirot had made his intentions clear. I doubted more than ever my ability to save Bella from the repercussions of her actions. This unfortunate encounter with Giraud had stirred Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and turned to see Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he suggested walking back to our hotel with us. ""And why are you here, M. Stonor?"" asked Poirot. ""One must support one's friends,"" replied the other dryly. ""Especially when they are wrongly accused."" ""Then you don't believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?"" I asked eagerly. ""Not at all. I know the young man. I admit there have been a few things in this matter that have completely astounded me, but despite his foolish way of handling it, I will never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer."" My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a hidden weight from my heart. ""I'm sure many others share your sentiment,"" I exclaimed. ""There is remarkably little evidence against him. I would say that his acquittal is certain, absolutely certain."" But Stonor hardly responded as I had hoped. ""I wish I could think as you do,"" he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. ""What's your opinion, monsieur?"" ""I believe the situation appears very bleak for him,"" said Poirot calmly. ""You think he's guilty?"" asked Stonor sharply. ""No. But I believe he will struggle to prove his innocence."" ""His behavior is so peculiar,"" muttered Stonor. ""Of course, I am aware that there is much more to this affair than meets the eye. Giraud is oblivious to it because he's an outsider, but the whole thing has been incredibly odd. But let's not dwell on that. If Mrs. Renauld wants to keep something under wraps, I'll follow her lead. It's her show, and I respect her judgment too much to interfere, but I can't make sense of Jack's attitude. One would think he wants to be seen as guilty."" ""But that's absurd,"" I interjected. ""For one thing, the dagger..."" I paused, unsure of how much Poirot would want me to disclose. I continued cautiously, selecting my words carefully, ""We are aware that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld's possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld is aware of that."" ""True,"" said Stonor. ""When she regains consciousness, she will undoubtedly confirm all this and more. Well, I must be going."" ""One moment."" Poirot's hand stopped his departure. ""Can you ensure that I am notified immediately if Madame Renauld wakes up?"" ""Certainly. That's easily arranged."" ""Your point about the dagger is valid, Poirot,"" I insisted as we ascended the stairs. ""I couldn't be too direct in front of Stonor."" ""That was the right decision. We might as well keep the information to ourselves for now. Regarding the dagger, your argument does little to help Jack Renauld. You recall that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we departed from London?"" ""Yes?"" ""Well, I was occupied with locating the company Jack Renauld had engaged to create his souvenirs. It wasn't very challenging. Well, Hastings, they produced not two paper-knives for him, but three."" ""So that ?"" ""So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he most likely kept for himself. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger matter will not assist us in preventing him from facing the guillotine."" ""It won't come to that,"" I exclaimed, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. ""You will save him,"" I declared confidently. Poirot looked at me dryly. ""You ask for miracles from me. Say no more. Instead, let us see what this letter contains."" And he pulled out the envelope from his pocket. His expression tightened as he read, then he handed the single sheet to me.",1
"Poirot paused, contemplating his next move. With everything in place, he scheduled a meeting with Mr. Lowen, a man who had dared to defy him in the past. After discreetly drilling into the safe, he instructed for the guest to be directed to the study before casually exiting the premises. The question lingered in the air, ""Where to now?""",1
"""Japp commended my enthusiasm for the case, a typical gesture from him that never failed to amuse me. Meanwhile, Poirot calmly reviewed his letters. One suggested a lecture for boy scouts, another a visit to the Countess of Forfanock - likely another lapdog owner. But the tone shifted when Poirot handed me a letter written on foreign paper. The urgent plea for detective services, the fear for one's life, and the mention of Santiago hinted at a mystery unlike any other. Poirot agreed to go, and with haste. Time was of the essence, and the Continental express awaited. There was no room for delay as we embarked on a journey filled with unknown dangers and secrets waiting to be unraveled.""",1

Continuing through Windsor and eventually arriving at Ascot, my pulse quickened. Ascot was where Daniels' aunt resided. It became clear that our target was him, not O’Murphy. Pulling up at the entrance of a well-maintained villa, Poirot swiftly exited the vehicle and pressed the doorbell. A look of concern shadowed his normally cheerful countenance. It was evident that he was not entirely convinced. The door was opened, and he was ushered into the house.",1
"""I had originally planned to leave in around a month's time,"" I mentioned.   ""Could you possibly leave sooner? This month, perhaps? Even this week?"" he inquired eagerly.  ""It is a possibility,"" I responded, studying him intently. ""But I must admit, I am not entirely keen on the idea.""  ""It would be a tremendous help to the Government, a truly remarkable service. And I assure you, they will show their appreciation,"" he explained.  ""So, you are essentially asking me to deliver a message?"" I clarified.  ""Exactly. Your role is unofficial, your trip legitimate. It would all be perfectly satisfactory,"" he assured me.  After a moment of consideration, I replied, ""Well, I suppose I have no objections. My main desire at the moment is to leave England as soon as possible.""",1
"“I was frozen in place.” “Come on, let's go for a walk,” she said cheerfully. I struggled to stand at first, but as we strolled back and forth I started to feel more alive.

"There, he assumed a new identity and built a vast fortune in South America. Despite his prominent status and changed appearance after two decades, he still longed for his homeland. Feeling secure in his anonymity, he decided to return, setting up base in England with plans to summer in France. However, fate had other plans as he found himself in Merlinville, where justice finally caught up to him.",1
"I preferred to work alone. Suzanne, exhausted from talking, suggested we discuss our next targets. Mr. Chichester was heading to Durban, Sir Eustace to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then Rhodesia. Suzanne hinted at involving Colonel Race in our plans. Despite her doubts, I insisted on keeping an eye on him. As we prepared to part ways, Suzanne promised to use her skills wisely. That night, standing alone on deck, I felt a sense of peace until danger approached. A shadowy figure attacked me, but was swiftly incapacitated by a familiar man with a scar. I joined in the pursuit, only to discover that the attacker was Guy Pagett. The revelation left us all stunned. Suspicious of my knowledge, the man with the scar confronted me. Offering my help, I was met with hostility. Despite the threat he posed, I remained unfazed, knowing the power I held over him. In a moment of defiance, he attempted to assert his dominance, but I refused to back down. The danger was real, but I refused to show fear.",1
"I sauntered casually down the sandy shore towards the opposite side of town. It crossed my mind that it might be a kind gesture to check on the girl. It would bring closure to the situation and prevent any further inconvenience. If I ignored her, she might show up at the Villa unexpectedly, causing a hassle. It seemed wiser to make a brief visit and clarify that I could offer no more help as a showman. Leaving the beach behind, I headed inland. I soon reached the modest Hôtel du Phare. It was frustrating not knowing the lady's name, so I decided to explore the interior to maintain my dignity. Merlinville was a small, simple town with limited attractions. A Casino was under construction, but not yet operational. Since I had not spotted her on the beach, she must be at the hotel. I entered. The lounge was occupied, but she was not present. I checked other rooms with no luck. After waiting impatiently, I discreetly approached the concierge and discreetly offered a bribe. ""I am looking for a lady staying here, a young English lady, petite and brunette. I am unsure of her name."" The concierge shook his head, hiding a smile. ""No one fitting that description is staying here."" ""Perhaps she is American,"" I suggested. These people were so dim-witted. But he continued to deny her presence. ""No, sir. There are only a few English and American ladies here, all older than the one you seek. She is not here."" His certainty made me question myself. ""But she informed me she was staying here."" ""You must be mistaken, sir, or perhaps the lady is. Another gentleman came looking for her, describing her as you have."" ""What did he look like?"" ""He was small, well-dressed, impeccably clean, with a stiff moustache, a unique head shape, and green eyes."" Poirot! That explained why he refused my company to the station. The audacity of it! I would prefer he stayed out of my affairs. Did he think I required a caretaker? Thanking the concierge, I left, perplexed and irritated by my intrusive friend. I wished he were within earshot to receive a piece of my mind. I had clearly stated I had no intention of seeing the girl. Certainly, one's friends can be overly interfering! But where was the lady? I pushed aside my anger and pondered the situation.",1
"“Did M. Renauld share any details of his will with you?” “I know all about it, took it to his lawyer after he drafted it. I can provide you with the name of his solicitors if you wish to review it. It's quite straightforward. Half to his wife in trust for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few small legacies. I believe he left me a thousand as well.” “When was this will created?” “Oh, approximately a year and a half ago.” “Would it shock you, M. Stonor, to learn that M. Renauld had recently made a new will, less than two weeks ago?” Stonor appeared visibly taken aback. “I had no clue about that.""",1
"""You don’t think,” I said, then paused. “Ah, no, it would be too dreadful!” Poirot glanced my way, but I remained silent. It dawned on me that among the seven women tied to the case - Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the enigmatic visitor, and the three maids - there was only one man, Jack Renauld. And a man would have been needed to dig the grave.",1
"""Trust me, I've examined all the details. M. Jack Renauld came on the train. There was an hour between his arrival and when he showed up at the house. It's likely he saw Captain Hastings and his partner leave the shed, sneaked in himself, grabbed the dagger, and stabbed his partner in the shed.""  ""Who was already deceased!"" Giraud raised his eyebrows. ""Maybe he didn't realize that. He might have thought the person was just sleeping. They must have had a meeting planned. Either way, he knew this second murder would make things much more complicated. And it did.""",1
"She revealed her face and I was shocked. Though resembling her greatly, this girl was not Cinderella! Without her stage wig, I recognized her as the girl from Jack Renauld’s photo. “Are you M. Hautet?” she asked. “Yes, but I must ” “I am Bella Duveen. I confess to killing Mr. Renauld.” “My Dear: “You will understand soon. Bella is determined. I am exhausted from the struggle. “You will learn of my deception and lies. I hope for your forgiveness before I vanish from your life. It was not for myself that I did it. “It began when we met on the Paris train. I was worried about Bella’s obsession with Jack Renauld. She was convinced he loved another girl, which turned out to be true. She wanted to go to their Villa at Merlinville to see Jack. I tried to stop her, but she eluded me. I knew something terrible would happen if I didn’t intervene. “I found her on the next train and she insisted on going to Merlinville. I argued to no avail. I left her and went to a hotel, feeling a sense of impending disaster. “The next day, Bella didn’t show up at our meeting spot. I feared the worst. When I read the news about Papa Renauld, I suspected Bella had confronted him and things took a tragic turn. “The masked foreigner revelation eased my mind, but Bella’s absence troubled me. I had to investigate. That’s when I crossed paths with you. You know the rest... When I saw the dead man, resembling Jack and wearing his coat, I knew! And there was the paper-knife Jack had given Bella, likely with her fingerprints on it.",1
"She was a stranger to the London crowd. The images of the Marlow victim in the newspapers were so distorted and unrecognizable that it's no surprise no one could make a positive identification. On the flip side, Nadina had kept her plans to visit England a well-guarded secret from everyone. The day following the murder, her manager received a letter supposedly from the dancer, stating she had to rush back to Russia for personal matters and he should handle her breached contract as he saw fit. All of this, naturally, I only found out later. With Suzanne's blessing, I sent a detailed cable from De Aar. It arrived at a critical moment (this, too, I discovered later on).",1
"""Les affaires show no mercy,"" he said. Mrs. Maltravers, with her red eyes and extraordinary beauty, sat down as he spoke. Her youthful appearance was striking, with blue eyes and a pouting mouth. ""Is this about my husband's insurance?"" she asked. ""Do I really need to deal with this now?"" ""Courage, my dear Madame,"" he reassured her. ""Your husband insured his life for a large sum, and the Company needs to verify some details. You can trust me to handle this matter delicately. Can you tell me what happened on Wednesday?"" She began, ""I was changing for tea when my maid informed me that one of the gardeners had found..."" Poirot, understanding her distress, gently squeezed her hand. ""Enough,"" he interrupted. ""Had you seen your husband earlier that day?"" ""Not since lunch,"" she replied. ""I went to the village for stamps and he was in the grounds."" ""Shooting rooks, was he?"" ""Yes, he usually took his rook rifle. I heard a few shots in the distance."" ""Where is the rifle now?"" ""In the hall, I believe."" She led him to the weapon, which he inspected briefly. ""Two shots fired,"" he noted, returning it to her. ""Now, if I may..."" he trailed off, and she nodded, turning away. Poirot was led upstairs by a servant, leaving me with the sorrowful woman. It was difficult to find the right words, and she responded absently to my attempts at conversation. Poirot returned shortly, thanking her for her cooperation. ""I do not believe we need to trouble you further,"" he assured her. ""Do you know anything about your husband's finances?"" She shook her head. ""I am not knowledgeable about such matters."" ""I see. Can you explain why he decided to insure his life recently?"" ""We had been married for just over a year. He believed he would not live long due to a premonition of his death. He had already experienced a hemorrhage and feared another would be fatal. I tried to reassure him, but he was convinced. Unfortunately, he was right."" With tears in her eyes, she bid us farewell. Walking back to London, Poirot made a thoughtful gesture. ""There seems to be no mystery here,"" he said. ""But there is a small discrepancy. Did you notice it?"" I shook my head, and he continued, ""Life is full of discrepancies, yet it is clear that he did not take his own life. There is no poison that would cause such bleeding.""",1
"""But the fearless liquor vendor adamantly denied their demands. Enraged by his defiance, one of the individuals promptly plunged a knife into his chest. Using the deceased man's keys, they unlocked the safe tucked away in the room, looting a stack of documents. Both suspects sported thick beards and concealed their faces behind masks, yet Madame Beroldy confidently asserted they hailed from Russia. The incident caused a significant uproar, earning nicknames such as “the Nihilist Outrage,” “Rebels in the City of Light,” and the “Enigma of the East.”""",1
"""The driver was startled, slamming on the brakes. The Prime Minister leaned out of the window. Two shots were fired in quick succession. The first grazed his cheek, the second missed. The driver, understanding the peril, accelerated ahead, dispersing the group of assailants.""   ""A close call,"" I exclaimed, feeling a chill. ""Mr. MacAdam downplayed the minor injury. He insisted it was just a scratch.""",1
"As we returned to Crabtree Manor in the early hours of the morning, Poirot wasted no time in heading straight for the study. Disregarding the confusion of the Bakers, he pulled out a key from the desk and removed an envelope attached to it. Despite its small size, he proceeded to carefully open the envelope and lay it out flat before us. My mind raced with questions as to what he hoped to find inside.",1
"“You see, Anne, despite the formalities, he’s in the clear. Sure, there are technicalities, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is a sure thing. Nothing now standing in the way of you two.” He spoke without making eye contact, his voice halting. “I get it,” I replied with relief. “And there’s no reason for him not to go back to his true identity.” “Absolutely not.” “Do you know his real name?” The question caught me off guard. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He stayed silent, a strange quality to it that gave me pause.",1
"""He may have had reason to suspect that you and I were on friendly terms,"" I replied, recalling our chat after leaving the Matoppos. ""He's quite a commanding figure,"" I added, ""though not what I expected from the 'Colonel.' Besides, the notion is preposterous. He's involved in the Secret Service."" ""But how can we be certain of that? It's simple to insinuate such things. Once the idea is out there, it spreads unchecked, becoming accepted as fact. It gives leeway for all sorts of shady dealings. Anne, what are your thoughts on Race?"" ""I'm torn, to be honest.""",1
"Thursday evening. Just departed Kimberley. Race recounted the diamond robbery tale once more. Why the fascination with diamonds amongst women? Anne Beddingfeld's true identity is revealed - a newspaper correspondent. She sent a lengthy cable from De Aar today, likely sharing her articles. She's been tracking ""The Man in the Brown Suit."" It seems she's uncovered the identity of the woman killed in my home, a Russian dancer named Nadina. Anne Beddingfeld's deductions are quite Sherlock Holmes-like, though it's more of an intuition. She's clever, even managing to secure a spot on the Daily Budget staff. Race mentioned that Rayburn may be heading to Rhodesia. Anne is determined to find him for the glory and fortune. Young women are ruthless these days. Race is wary of the situation. Perhaps Rayburn is on our train, putting us all in danger. Mrs. Blair seems oddly welcoming to the idea. Tomorrow, we cross Bechuanaland.",1
"""What was it that killed Luigi Valdarno?"" questioned the Italian hoarsely, waving the gun menacingly at us. Frozen in fear, we remained still. ""My dear Poirot, this is a disaster. What do we do now?"" I exclaimed. Poirot silenced me with a gesture. ""Please, Hastings, refrain from speaking excessively. Rest assured, our friend will not shoot until I allow it."" The Italian sneered, ""Are you sure about that?"" Unsure myself, the woman turned to Poirot for guidance. ""What is your demand?"" Poirot nodded respectfully. ""I believe Miss Elsa Hardt is intelligent enough to comprehend without explanation."" In a swift motion, the woman grabbed a black velvet cat cover for the telephone. ""The answer lies in the lining of this."" ""Impressive,"" Poirot murmured, stepping aside. ""Good evening, madame. I will detain your companion from New York while you escape."" ""What a fool!"" the Italian bellowed, attempting to shoot the woman as I lunged at him. Fortunately, the gun misfired, prompting Poirot's reproachful voice. ""You should never trust your friends with loaded weapons, Hastings. I wouldn't even allow an acquaintance to do so. No, no, my friend."" Addressing the Italian with a gentle scold, Poirot continued, ""I have saved you from a hanging. Rest assured, the police are waiting outside. A comforting thought, isn't it? You may leave now, but be cautious."" The Italian left, leaving me to stare at Poirot in disbelief. ""It was all so obvious! It was evident, right from the start, that out of the numerous applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions, only the Robinsons were chosen. But why? What made them stand out so easily? Was it their appearance? Perhaps, but it wasn't extraordinary. Their name, then!"" ""But Robinson is a common surname,"" I interjected. Poirot smiled knowingly. ""Exactly! That was the key. Elsa Hardt and her companion, from New York, rented the flat under the name Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. When they discovered they were being pursued by a secret society like the Mafia or the Camorra, to which Luigi Valdarno likely belonged, they devised a simple plan. They knew their pursuers were unfamiliar with them. So, what better solution than to offer the flat at a low price? Among the many young couples in London searching for a flat, there were bound to be other Robinsons. It was just a matter of time.""",1
"Wealth in jewels, cash on hand, and bearer bonds - all meticulously organized, but for whom? Monsieur Davenheim, a man who prioritized self-preservation above all else, seemed the most likely beneficiary. His recent obsession with purchasing jewelry made it all too clear. It appeared that he had embezzled funds, traded them for gems, possibly substituting them with fake replicas, and stashed away a substantial fortune under an alias, waiting for the perfect moment to claim it without a soul suspecting a thing.",1
"""You continue to frequent Rhodesia, I presume, to monitor Pagett,"" he inquired. ""And yourself?"" This was the dilemma I faced. Did Chichester board the Kilmorden, or did he not? Was he still intent on traveling to Durban as he originally planned? The timing of his departure from Muizenberg suggested an affirmative response to both inquiries. If that were the case, I could take the train to Durban. I had a feeling I would arrive before the ship.",1
"As my deductions proved false, I faced the risk of humiliation and losing all my money on a worthless pursuit. My heart raced anxiously, and then, at the stroke of one, silence. But suddenly, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the hallway. Before I could react, a man crashed through my cabin door, gasping for help. ""Save me,"" he pleaded desperately. There was no time for questions, as I heard the approaching footsteps of those chasing him. With only seconds to spare, I had to make a decision.",1
"In the dead of night, the Villa lay shrouded in darkness, its inhabitants fast asleep. Poirot's gaze was fixed on Mrs. Renauld's window, open and inviting. Suddenly, a cry for help pierced the silence, followed by a struggle in the room. With lightning speed, Poirot sprang into action, scaling a tree and leaping through the window. Meanwhile, Cinderella, the acrobat, swung from branch to branch with ease. Together, they rescued Mrs. Renauld from the clutches of danger. As the truth unraveled, Marthe Daubreuil's lifeless body revealed a sinister plot. The pieces of the puzzle fell into place, exposing a web of deception and greed. The night's events left me bewildered, but Poirot's astute deductions brought clarity to the darkness.",1
"I raced back to the station, darting through the bustling crowd. The clock struck eleven as I leapt onto the moving train. The porter's futile attempt to restrain me only fueled my determination. With a swift maneuver, I found myself aboard the train, leaving behind a bewildered Mr. Pagett on the platform. The conductor quickly became an obstacle in my escape.",1
""" The inspector glanced around the room. ""Any witnesses to the crime, sir?"" ""There's the old housekeeper, Françoise, who has been with the family for decades. And then there are the two sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard, from a respectable family in Merlinville. The chauffeur, brought from England by Mr. Renauld, is currently on vacation. Lastly, we have Mrs. Renauld and her son, Jack Renauld, who are both out of town."" Poirot nodded, taking in the information.",1
"As I gazed at Table Mountain, I heard a footfall behind me. Rayburn appeared, apologizing for his behavior. He warned me about the danger I was in, advising me to stay out of it. His cryptic words left me unsettled, as he hinted at his own impending fate. After a brief farewell, he left me alone on the deck, footsteps echoing in my mind. The following hours brought a sense of unease, relieved only when I reached the wharf and left the boat behind. The warm sun, flowers, and delicious food at the hotel lifted my spirits, contrasting sharply with the cold, rainy days of England. Suzanne's nonchalance at the beauty around us puzzled me, as I reveled in the new experiences South Africa offered. Later, a note from the Museum curator led me on an unexpected visit, turning into a perilous encounter with a man who was definitely not who he seemed. The situation grew tense as I tried to outwit my captor, relying on quick thinking and a bit of bluffing to buy myself time. The outcome remained uncertain, as I faced the unknown with a mixture of fear and determination.",1
"""Colonel Race is heading to Rhodesia as well,” Suzanne mused. “If we could persuade Sir Eustace to extend an invitation to him too.” “You have a way with words. You can manipulate any situation.” “I have a soft spot for butter,” Suzanne purred. We agreed that Suzanne would utilize her skills to their fullest potential. I was too filled with anticipation to retire for the night. Tomorrow morning, we would arrive in Table Bay. I quietly made my way up to the deck. The breeze was brisk and refreshing. The boat gently swayed in the rough sea. The decks were dim and empty.""",1
"Before reaching him, the man scanned the road for witnesses, then discreetly discarded a small object over the hedge. Continuing on his way, the object emitted a faint sound that caught the attention of a passerby. Upon investigation, a valuable ring was found. Kellett claims this as truth, though Lowen vehemently denies it. Kellett's credibility is questionable, and it is unlikely that he encountered Davenheim in the lane and committed such a heinous act. Poirot dismisses the theory, citing lack of evidence and logic. Japp, however, questions Lowen's lack of foresight in disposing of the ring. The possibility of the ring being traced back to Davenheim is considered, suggesting a more sinister plot. The lime kiln near the lake becomes a focal point of discussion, hinting at a gruesome fate for the victim. Poirot's keen observation leads to a peculiar inquiry about the Davenheims' sleeping arrangements, perplexing his companions. As Poirot delves deeper into his thoughts, a new perspective emerges, shedding light on the overlooked details of the case.",1
"I never respond."" ""I concur, my friend. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it's as you say. But there's always that one time! Still, that situation won't happen, since you don't plan on seeing the woman again."" His final words were almost a question, and I noticed the sharpness of his glance towards me. And in my mind, written boldly in flames, were the words ""Hôtel du Phare,"" and I could hear her voice once more saying ""Come find me"" and my eager reply: ""I will."" So what? I had intended to visit her initially. But after some thought, I had changed my mind. I didn't care for the girl.",1
"I confess I haven't had the chance to inspect them yet, but I can already tell that one stands out from the rest. It's heavier, makes a strange noise when shaken, and appears to be sealed shut with seccotine, requiring a tin-opener to access. The situation seems quite obvious, wouldn't you agree? And now, I have successfully ensnared both of you. It's a shame you rejected the opportunity to be Lady Pedler."" My silence lingered as I gazed back at him.",1
"""I chose Harry as my secretary to keep him close and away from the police,"" she explained. ""Nadina, that cunning woman, was using Harry to manipulate me. She demanded a high price for the cursed diamonds, threatening to sell them back to him if I didn't comply. I underestimated her - I thought she would have the diamonds on her that day, but she outsmarted me. And with Carton, her late husband, also out of the picture, the diamonds' whereabouts remained a mystery to me.""",1
"“I couldn’t sleep. I was restless, disturbed, had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream,” he explained.   ""Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I inquired.   He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death.”",1
"""Someone has slipped our minds,"" Poirot exclaimed with a sparkle in his eyes. ""Georges Conneau!"" Poirot greeted me warmly as I arrived alone. ""Excellent! You've made it. It's fantastic! Keep going with your deductions. You are correct. We should not have overlooked Georges Conneau."" Feeling flattered by Poirot's approval, I found it hard to continue. Gathering my thoughts, I pressed on. ""Georges Conneau vanished twenty years ago, but there is no evidence of his demise."" ""Absolutely,"" Poirot concurred. ""Go on."" ""Therefore, let's assume he is still alive."" ""Precisely."" ""Or was alive until recently."" ""Even better!"" ""Let's assume,"" I continued, my excitement growing, ""that he has fallen on hard times. He has turned into a criminal, a tramp, whatever you want to call it. He happens to arrive in Merlinville. There he encounters the woman he has always loved."" ""Ah, the sentimental touch,"" Poirot cautioned. ""Where there is hate, there is also love,"" I quoted or misquoted. ""At the very least, he finds her there, living under an alias. But she now has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Enraged by past grievances, Georges Conneau confronts Renauld. He ambushes him as he goes to see his mistress and fatally stabs him. Fearing the consequences, he begins to dig a grave. I imagine that Madame Daubreuil comes out in search of her lover. She and Conneau have a heated argument. He drags her into the shed and then suddenly has an epileptic seizure. Now, picture Jack Renauld appearing. Madame Daubreuil confesses everything to him, highlighting the dire consequences for her daughter if their scandalous past is exposed. With his father's killer now dead, they agree to keep it under wraps. Jack Renauld consents, goes to the house, and convinces his mother to go along with the plan. Armed with the story suggested by Madame Daubreuil, she allows herself to be tied up and silenced. So, Poirot, what do you make of that?"" I leaned back, proud of my reconstruction. Poirot gazed at me thoughtfully. ""I believe you should write for the cinema, my friend,"" he finally remarked. ""You think?"" ""It could be a great movie, the tale you've just narrated, but it's far from reality."" ""I admit I haven't delved into all the specifics, but..."" ""You've gone even further, magnificently ignoring them. What about how the two men were dressed? Do you propose that after the stabbing, Conneau changed into his victim's clothes and hid the murder weapon?"" ""I don't see how that's relevant,"" I replied somewhat defensively. ""He may have coerced Madame Daubreuil into giving him clothes and money earlier in the day."" ""Through threats, you say? You seriously suggest that scenario?"" ""Absolutely. He could have threatened to expose her true identity to the Renaulds, jeopardizing her daughter's marriage."" ""You're mistaken, Hastings. He couldn't blackmail her; she held the upper hand. Remember, Georges Conneau is still a murder suspect. A single word from her and he's at risk of the guillotine.""",1
"""I mistook you for my secretary,"" I protested. ""But you've been neglecting Miss Pettigrew to keep me company all afternoon."" ""No matter what I've been up to, I can promise you it wasn't that,"" I reassured her. Thursday evening. We've just departed from Kimberley. Race was coerced into recounting the tale of the diamond theft once more. Why do women get so worked up over anything related to diamonds? Finally, Anne Beddingfeld has revealed her hidden identity. Turns out she's a journalist. She sent a lengthy cable from De Aar this morning. From the nonstop chatter that emanated from Mrs. Blair's cabin last night, it seems she might have been reading her articles aloud for hours on end.",1
"The light was switched off without delay, followed by the gradual creak of the door opening. Poirot and I pressed ourselves flush against the wall. The sound of a man's breath filled the air as he moved past us. Suddenly, a torch illuminated the room, prompting Poirot to whisper urgently in my ear: ""Go."" With synchronized precision, we lunged forward. Poirot deftly covered the intruder's head with a soft scarf, while I restrained his arms. The entire operation was swift and silent.",1
"There was a shift in his demeanor towards me. ""I bring news. Your young man is en route. He will arrive shortly. Control your excitement, for there is more. This morning, you tried to trick me. I advised honesty, and you followed... until you didn't. You claimed the diamonds were with Harry Rayburn. I played along, as it helped lure him here.""",1
"""His theory's coping-stone, my last answer. I give up,"" I flung my hands in despair. As we sped towards London on the train, Poirot wrote busily, sealing the result in an envelope for Inspector McNeil. Dropping it at Scotland Yard, we headed to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where Miss Esmée Farquhar awaited. ""And Ridgeway?"" I inquired. Poirot twinkled, ""What about him?""",1
"""Not even when he came out again looking all queer."" ""How long was he in the house?"" ""Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe."" ""How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?"" ""I should say so maybe."" ""He was clean-shaven, you say?"" ""Yes, miss not even one of these toothbrush moustaches."" ""Was his chin at all shiny?"" I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. ""Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it was. However did you know?"" ""It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,"" I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. ""Really, now, miss. I never heard that before."" ""You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?"" ""Just the ordinary kind, miss. I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?"" I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence my question to Mrs. James. Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low old-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key, I passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn and mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had come here “smiling to herself” a few days ago feel no chill of premonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, ""atmosphere."" There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil.",1
"""Inquire if she would be willing to disclose the information. It may escape your notice, but the strength of your bond has been put to the test and proven unbreakable. Both of you have shown readiness to make the ultimate sacrifice for one another.” As for Captain Arthur Hastings, the modest chronicler within these pages, rumors circulate about his intention to accompany the Renaulds to a ranch overseas. However, for the conclusion of this tale, I opt to revisit a morning at the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I find it difficult to address you as Bella,” I remarked, “considering it is not your given name. And Dulcie appears rather unfamiliar.""",1
"“That’s all,” he continued. “You got that, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, and meet Mr. Everett, a talented actor. I called him earlier. His disguise is impressive, resembling the victim perfectly with the help of a flashlight and some glow-in-the-dark paint. I recommend not touching her right hand, Hastings. The red paint will transfer. I held her hand when the lights went out. And let’s not forget about our train. Inspector Japp is waiting outside the window.”",1
"I could feel my anger bubbling up inside me. ""You must be aware of the man who was found dead in the Tube, right? The man who had a note to view this very house in Marlow in his possession."" The inspector nodded. ""You're Miss Beddingfeld, the one who testified at the inquest. Yes, the man did have a note in his pocket. But so could many others who weren't killed."" Gathering my composure, I continued. ""Isn't it strange that he had no ticket in his pocket?"" The inspector shrugged. ""It's easy to lose a ticket. I've done it before."" I pressed on. ""And no money.""",1
"We chatted aimlessly for a while. “Miss Beddingfeld, I believe I crossed paths with your father before. He was quite the expert in his field, which happens to intrigue me as well. I’ve dabbled in it personally, especially during my time in Dordogne.” Our conversation turned more detailed. Colonel Race was certainly knowledgeable, although he did make a few peculiar errors in his speech, almost as if intentional.",1
"It's possible that many people in the world have never heard of the discovery of an ancient skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. One morning, I found Papa in a state of extreme excitement, almost to the point of apoplexy. He eagerly shared the entire story with me. ""Do you see, Anne? While there are certain similarities to the Java skull, they are only superficial. No, what we have here is, as I've always argued, the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. Do you agree that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive among the Neanderthal skulls discovered? Why is that? Because the cradle of the race was in Africa.""",1
"""Detecting the theft so early disrupted her entire scheme. They are undoubtedly in this vicinity. One of them must have concealed the items, and it is highly improbable that the chambermaid is responsible."" ""More than improbable, it is impossible!"" Poirot remarked calmly. ""What?"" The inspector was incredulous. Poirot grinned humbly. ""Allow me to illustrate. Hastings, my dear friend, handle my watch with care. It is a precious family heirloom! I have just measured Mademoiselle's movements - her first absence lasted twelve seconds, while her second lasted fifteen. Now, observe my movements. Madame, if you would be so kind as to provide me with the jewel-case key.""",1
"""Papa Poirot warned me against her, saying she's not meant for me,"" I exclaimed. ""But the commissary vouched for her, claiming she's both good and beautiful, like a perfect angel!"" Poirot replied cheerfully, ""Some of the worst criminals I've encountered had the most innocent faces. A deformity in the brain cells can easily mask behind the visage of a saint."" Shocked, I protested, ""Surely, Poirot, you can't possibly suspect an innocent young girl like her!"" Poirot waved off my concern, saying, ""Calm down! I never mentioned suspecting her.""",1
"""I see no need to explain to Miss Elsa Hardt,"" the woman said, grabbing a large black velvet cat that concealed the telephone. Poirot nodded in approval. ""Well done. Good evening, madame. I will keep your friend occupied while you escape,"" he remarked, stepping away from the door. The big Italian yelled in anger and shot at the woman as she ran away, but I intervened just in time.",1
"""Parties often join me on my boat from the hotel, but I lead a frugal life and mostly enjoy my freedom.” “Do you reside here by yourself?” “I have no longing for company,” he responded icily. “I apologize for imposing mine on you,” I quipped, “but I had little say in the matter.” Surprisingly, his eyes sparkled slightly. “None at all. I carried you to my boat like a bundle of coal. Reminiscent of a primal man from the Stone Age.” “But for a different purpose,” I remarked. This time, he blushed deeply, his face turning a fiery red.",1
"""Have you ever laid eyes on him before?” Madame Daubreuil inquired, stepping closer to the victim, a hint of color returning to her cheeks. She examined him with a mix of curiosity and intrigue before shaking her head. “I am not familiar with him.” Giraud, convinced of her sincerity, gave a slight nod before turning his attention elsewhere. I whispered, “Are you releasing her? What about the black strands of hair?” Giraud responded dryly, “I am well aware of my duties. She is being closely watched. No need for immediate arrest.”",1
"“Sir Eustace believed Rayburn had some leverage over him,” I pondered aloud. “Maybe Pagett too?” Sir Eustace defended Pagett as a hard-working young man. Rayburn, the 'Man in the Brown Suit,' tried to reach Cabin 17 on the 22nd but was knifed by Chichester. Cable Lord Nasby that you found 'The Man in the Brown Suit' and claim your fortune, Anne,” Suzanne encouraged. “Rayburn matches the description from Scotland Yard,” she continued. “Dolichocephalic, long-headed,” I replied, hoping to avoid suspicion. But Suzanne pressed on, asking about the opposite. ""Brachycephalic,"" I reluctantly admitted. Finally, I confessed my feelings for Rayburn, vowing to find him no matter the cost. Suzanne marveled at my passion, remarking on my lack of sentimentality. In the end, there would be no message to Lord Nasby.",1
"“Do you have the gardener’s old clothes?” Poirot inquired. “Indeed,” Giraud confirmed. Poirot crouched beside the body and swiftly, methodically examined the clothes. Not a single mark could be found. He paid close attention to the boots, as well as the dirty, broken fingernails. While inspecting the nails, he directed a question to Giraud. “Did you see these?” “I did,” Giraud replied, his expression unreadable. Suddenly, Poirot tensed. “Dr. Durand!” “Yes?” The doctor approached. “There is foam on the lips. Did you notice?” “I must confess I did not.” “But you see it now?” “Certainly.” Poirot turned to Giraud with another inquiry. “You definitely saw it, correct?” The response from Giraud was silence. Poirot continued his examination. The dagger had been removed from the wound and was now placed in a glass jar next to the body. After inspecting it, Poirot closely examined the wound. When he looked up, his eyes gleamed with the familiar green light. “This is a peculiar wound! No blood, no stains on the clothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured. What do you think, Dr.?” “It is quite unusual,” the doctor agreed. “Not unusual at all. It’s quite simple. The man was stabbed after his death.” Silencing the rising voices with a gesture, Poirot turned to Giraud. “You concur, Monsieur, don't you?” Regardless of Giraud's actual beliefs, he accepted the assertion without a hint of emotion. Coolly and almost scornfully, he responded: “I do indeed.” The room erupted in murmurs of surprise and intrigue. “But how barbaric!” exclaimed M. Hautet. “To stab a dead man! Unheard of! Perhaps out of unrelenting hatred.” “No, Monsieur,” Poirot countered. “I believe it was done with calculated intention to make an impression.” “What kind of impression?” “The exact impression it almost succeeded in making,” Poirot cryptically replied. M. Bex pondered. “Then how did the man die?” “He was not killed. He passed away. I believe, Monsieur, that he died from an epileptic seizure!” Poirot's statement caused a stir. Dr. Durand knelt down again, conducting a thorough examination. Finally, he rose. “Well, Dr.?” “Poirot, I believe you are correct. I was initially misled. The focus on the stabbing obscured other signs.” Poirot was praised by the examining magistrate. After graciously acknowledging the compliments, Poirot excused himself and I for not having had lunch yet. As we were leaving, Giraud approached. “One more thing, Poirot,” he said mockingly. “We found this tangled around the dagger handle. A woman's hair.” “Ah!” Poirot exclaimed. “Whose hair, I wonder?” “I wonder too,” Giraud replied with a bow before departing. “Giraud is persistent,” Poirot mused as we headed to the hotel. “I wonder what misdirection he hopes to achieve. A woman’s hair, hm!” We enjoyed a hearty lunch, but Poirot seemed preoccupied and distracted. Later, in our sitting room, I urged him to reveal details of his mysterious trip to Paris. “Of course, my friend. I went to Paris to locate this.” From his pocket, Poirot retrieved a faded newspaper clipping. It displayed a woman's photograph. Handing it to me, I couldn't help but exclaim. “You recognize her, my friend?” I nodded. Despite the antiquated style of the photo and hair, the resemblance was unmistakable. “Madame Daubreuil!” I declared. Poirot shook his head with a smile. “Not quite, my friend. She went by a different name back then. This is the infamous Madame Beroldy!” In an instant, memories of the Beroldy Case flooded back. Two decades prior, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, a native of Lyons, arrived in Paris with his wife and young daughter. Monsieur Beroldy, a middle-aged man, was unremarkable, while his wife, surrounded by mystery and intrigue, captivated the neighbourhood. Rumors swirled about her mysterious lineage, with tales of Russian or Austrian royalty. Close friends heard of political plots, secret papers, and impending dangers. Crown jewels were said to be involved, with Madame Beroldy acting as the intermediary. Among their acquaintances was young lawyer, Georges Conneau.",1
"""If the kidnappers are keeping him hidden, they have leverage to negotiate with both parties. The German Government may not be generous, but they could be forced to pay up in a situation like this. Plus, there's no fear of facing the gallows. Kidnapping is clearly their specialty."" ""So, why attempt to shoot him first?"" Poirot's frustration was evident.",1
"I had a momentary respite, but the situation soon escalated. I was bound and gagged in a dusty attic, unable to call for help. After a grueling struggle, I managed to free myself using a shard of glass. The Dutchman and Chichester discussed their plans, involving diamonds and secrecy. I escaped the house and embarked on a journey to find Chichester, who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of a mysterious ""Colonel."" Unfortunately, I missed the boat he was on and had to decide on my next move. Meanwhile, Sir Eustace faced his own troubles with a troublesome secretary.",1
"In the midst of it all, a feeling of malevolence surrounded me, a sinister presence lurking in the shadows. The chilling possibility crossed my mind - could I be next? Poirot, with a sense of unease in his voice, muttered, ""Mon Dieu, I cannot comprehend this. It's dreadful. Please, sir, tell me, was it truly tetanus?"" ""I don't think so. But Dr. Ames will have more information,"" I replied. ""Ah, you're not the doctor,"" Poirot observed. ""I go by the name Tosswill."" This man, then, was the English specialist mentioned by Lady Willard, supposedly a minor figure at the British Museum. Yet there was a seriousness and determination in his demeanor that caught my attention. ""If you'd follow me,"" Dr.",1
"Hardly knowing what to do next, I managed to leave the scene appearing somewhat composed. However, it was only a matter of time before the crime would be uncovered, and my likeness broadcasted far and wide. I realized with dismay that I had unwittingly fallen into the ‘Colonel’s’ clutches once more. It was clear that by outsmarting the blackmailer, the blackmailed had cleverly shifted blame onto me. The cunning hand of the ‘Colonel’ was unmistakable in this elaborate scheme.",1
"Quickly my suspicions were aroused. I discovered that he was actually setting sail for England on the Kilmorden Castle, departing Cape Town in two days. I barely had time to board the same boat. I made sure not to alert Carton to my presence by disguising myself as a serious, older gentleman. I observed Carton from a distance on the boat, pretending to be ill to avoid any interaction. After arriving in London, I followed him to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. Anita Grünberg unexpectedly appeared, adding to my hatred for her. She seemed to have a pre-planned meeting with Carton. I started making assumptions, linking Sir Eustace to the mysterious 'Colonel'. However, my plans took a turn when I found Anita dead in Marlow. This unexpected turn of events left me in a precarious situation, with the 'Colonel' framing me for the murder. I had to lay low and find a way to clear my name. After a conversation with Harry, our focus shifted to the identity of the 'Colonel'. We considered various possibilities, including the involvement of Guy Pagett. As we discussed further, new theories and suspicions arose, leading us to question everything we thought we knew.",1
"""I glared at him, but he continued: “You may call me heartless, but one mustn’t dwell on sentimentality. It’s pointless to resist, I won’t allow you to have them. This is a rough land, and I hold the upper hand.” Defeated, I made my way to the car, tears welling up. “They’re just a bit hungry today,” he reassured me. “His wife went to Bulawayo for supplies. Everything will be fine. Besides, there are plenty of starving creatures in this world.” “Stop it,” I snapped back.""",1
"""We have Lowen in custody. A maid claims she saw him heading towards the study through the rose-garden around 6:15 PM. Lowen initially denied leaving the study, but later said he went out to examine a rose. Suspiciously, Mr. Davenheim's ring was pawned by a man named Billy Kellett, who has a criminal record. Kellett alleges he found the ring after seeing a man with a moustache toss it over a hedge near Chingside station. However, Poirot doubts Kellett's story due to lack of evidence. Japp agrees that Kellett's credibility is questionable, but still considers his account. Poirot points out flaws in Kellett's story, highlighting the unlikelihood of him being the culprit.""",1
"""And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course.",0
"You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” “I shall manage,” I said airily. “Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o’clock train to-morrow, Wednesday, morning,” Pagett continued.",0
"Inspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I considered a peculiarly irritating manner. A satellite, also in plain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner. “Good morning,” I said nervously. “Good morning. Will you take a seat? I understand you’ve something to tell me that you think may be of use to us.” His tone seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the extreme. I felt my temper stirred. “Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.” “Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his pocket. A lot of other people may have had too only they didn’t happen to be killed.” I rallied my forces. “You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?” “Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.” “And no money.” “He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.” “But no notecase.” “Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.” I tried another tack. “You don’t think it’s odd that the doctor never came forward afterwards?” “A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers. He probably forgot all about the accident.” “In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I said sweetly. “Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know fond of mysteries and such-like. But as I’m a busy man” I took the hint and rose. The man in the corner raised a meek voice. “Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?” The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough. “Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don’t be offended. You’ve asked questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.” I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall. “You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?” “Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened. What frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us some one he recognized.” “You didn’t see any one?” “No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.” “Nothing unusual in that,” said the inspector dryly. “But he wasn’t a doctor.” “What?” “He wasn’t a doctor,” I repeated. “How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?” “It’s difficult to say, exactly. I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies. There’s a sort of deft professional callousness that this man hadn’t got. Besides, a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.” “He did that?” “Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time except that I felt there was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.” “H’m,” said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and paper. “In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.” “Doesn’t sound likely to me,” said the inspector. “But well, can you describe him at all?” “He was tall and broad-shouldered, wore a dark overcoat and black boots, a bowler hat. He had a dark pointed beard and gold-rimmed eyeglasses.” “Take away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses, and there wouldn’t be much to know him by,” grumbled the inspector. “He could alter his appearance easy enough in five minutes if he wanted to which he would do if he’s the swell pickpocket you suggest.” I had not intended to suggest anything of the kind. But from this moment I gave the inspector up as hopeless. “Nothing more you can tell us about him?” he demanded, as I rose to depart. “Yes,” I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. “His head was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to alter that.” I observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow’s pen wavered. It was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic. In the first heat of indignation I found my next step unexpectedly easy to tackle. I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went into Scotland Yard. One to be carried out if my interview there was unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That is, if I had the nerve to go through with it. Things that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily tackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect, I walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby. Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the Daily Budget. He owned other papers several of them, but the Daily Budget was his special child. It was as the owner of the Daily Budget that he was known to every householder in the United Kingdom. Owing to the fact that an itinerary of the great man’s daily proceedings had just been published, I knew exactly where to find him at this moment. It was his hour for dictating to his secretary in his own house. I did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to come and ask for him would be at once admitted to the august presence. But I had attended to that side of the matter. In the card-tray in the hall of the Flemmings’ house I had observed the card of the Marquis of Loamsley, England’s most famous sporting peer. I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs, and pencilled upon it the words: “Please give Miss Beddingfeld a few moments of your time.” Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous in their methods. The thing worked. A powdered footman received the card and bore it away. Presently a pale secretary appeared. I fenced with him successfully. He retired defeated. He again reappeared and begged me to follow him. I did so. I entered a large room, a frightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant from the spirit-world. Then the door shut and I was face to face with Lord Nasby. A big man. Big head. Big face. Big moustache. Big stomach. I pulled myself together. I had not come here to comment on Lord Nasby’s stomach. He was already roaring at me. “Well, what is it? What does Loamsley want? You his secretary? What’s it all about?” “To begin with,” I said with as great an appearance of coolness as I could manage, “I don’t know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows nothing about me. I took his card from the tray in the house of the people I’m staying with, and I wrote those words on it myself. It was important that I should see you.” For a moment it appeared to be a toss up as to whether Lord Nasby had apoplexy or not. In the end, he swallowed twice and got over it. “I admire your coolness, young woman. Well, you see me! If you interest me, you will continue to see me for exactly two minutes longer.” “That will be ample,” I replied. “And I shall interest you. It’s the Mill House Mystery.” “If you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ write to the Editor,” he interrupted hastily. “If you will interrupt, I shall be more than two minutes,” I said sternly. “I haven’t found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ but I’m quite likely to do so.” In as few words as possible I put the facts of the Tube accident and the conclusions I had drawn from them before him. When I had finished he said unexpectedly: “What do you know of brachycephalic heads?” I mentioned Papa. “The Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind upon your own shoulders, young woman. But it’s all pretty thin, you know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us as it stands.” “I’m perfectly aware of that.” “What d’you want, then?” “I want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.” “Can’t do that. We’ve got our own special man on it.” “And I’ve got my own special knowledge.” “What you’ve just told me, eh?” “Oh, no, Lord Nasby. I’ve still got something up my sleeve.” “Oh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl. Well, what is it?” “When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece of paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead man. The doctor didn’t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some figures.” “Let’s see it.” Lord Nasby stretched out a careless hand. “I think not,” I said, smiling. “It’s my find, you see.” “I’m right. You are a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it. No scruples about not handing it over to the police?” “I went there to do so this morning. They persisted in regarding the whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so I thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining the paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.” “Short-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here’s all I can do for you. Go on working on this line of yours. If you get anything anything that’s publishable send it along and you shall have your chance. There’s always room for real talent on the Daily Budget. But you’ve got to make good first. See?” I thanked him, and apologized for my methods. “Don’t mention it. I rather like cheek from a pretty girl. By the way, you said two minutes and you’ve been three, allowing for interruptions. For a woman, that’s quite remarkable! Must be your scientific training.” I was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been running. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance. I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen.” Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless. I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life. If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13” like that. There was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably the cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to title?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?) Yes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure. Figures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right, seven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps. That sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to get to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible. I made a strategic sally from my room and returned laden with books of reference. Who’s Who_, Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of Scotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other’s British Isles. Time passed. I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance. Finally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no such place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There must be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the “scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to let presumably was still to let. I would be a prospective tenant. I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers. “Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not not where” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying.",0
"The solution did not commend itself to me, because, as I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one finds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very likely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir paper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all the time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld. When she actually came forward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And yet I was not satisfied, mon ami. I was not satisfied.",0
"“His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily.",0
"Taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on the fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention that inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot’s prognostication. No such woman as “Mrs. Middleton” had ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection. “Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.” “It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?” “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “Précisément and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.” “Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.",0
"The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know.",0
"“More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that the man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the affair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.” He stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me of being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the thought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of inspecting a miniature revolution at first hand. “No trains are running from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he continued. “But I can arrange to send you over by private car.",0
"Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let’s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind I want the truth.” I was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace’s shrewdness. It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t.",0
"There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat.",0
"He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch.",0
"’ Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched. Wisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be dangerous? he retires gracefully with an enormous fortune!” “H’m!” said the Count doubtfully. “It is rather upsetting for all of us. We are at a loose end, as it were.” “But we are being paid off on a most generous scale!” Something, some undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her sharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity.",0
"Bleibner with the deadly germs. Then the nephew, overcome with despair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot himself. Mr. Bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will. His fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.” “And Mr. Schneider?” “We cannot be sure. He knew young Bleibner too, remember, and may have suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought that a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen the coils of superstition. Furthermore, I will tell you an interesting psychological fact, Hastings. A murderer has always a strong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of it grows upon him. Hence my fears for young Willard. The figure of Anubis you saw to-night was Hassan, dressed up by my orders. I wanted to see if I could frighten the doctor. But it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him. I could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult. The little comedy I played for him did not deceive him. I suspected that he would endeavour to make me the next victim. Ah, but in spite of la mer maudite, the heat abominable, and the annoyances of the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!” Poirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. Young Bleibner, some years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular will, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.” The case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb of Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomb a belief which, as Poirot pointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought. “Poirot,” I said, “a change of air would do you good.” “You think so, mon ami?” “I am sure of it.” “Eh eh?” said my friend, smiling. “It is all arranged, then?” “You will come?” “Where do you propose to take me?” “Brighton. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put me on to a very good thing, and well, I have money to burn, as the saying goes. I think a week-end at the Grand Metropolitan would do us all the good in the world.” “Thank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.” I did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities. But his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance aside. “Then, that’s all right,” I said hastily. Saturday evening saw us dining at the Grand Metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at Brighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste were something magnificent. “Hein, it is a sight this!” murmured Poirot. “This is the home of the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?” “Supposed to be,” I replied. “But we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred with the Profiteering brush.” Poirot gazed round him placidly. “The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains to crime, instead of to its detection. What a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction! Regard, Hastings, that stout woman by the pillar. She is, as you would say, plastered with gems.” I followed his eyes. “Why,” I exclaimed, “it’s Mrs. Opalsen.” “You know her?” “Slightly. Her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in the recent Oil boom.” After dinner we ran across the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended by having our coffee together. Poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the lady’s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once. “It’s a perfect hobby of mine, Mr. Poirot. I just love jewellery. Ed knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me something new. You are interested in precious stones?” “I have had a good deal to do with them one time and another, madame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world.” He went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with bated breath. “There now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “If it isn’t just like a play! You know, I’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them. I believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!” “Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!” “Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.” The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly. “Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,” explained the latter. “Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. “Well, they are worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the money’s there all right; I could get what I paid for them any day perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are now. Money’s confoundedly tight in the City. All this infernal E.P.",0
"le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “Eh bien! I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice.",0
"But what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn’t marry him. He doesn’t sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy keeping high explosive in the house! So there’s to be no cabling to Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “And yet you believe him to be innocent?” “I also believe that innocent people can be hanged.” “Hm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In spite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.” “No,” I said. “He didn’t.” “That’s sentiment.” “No, it isn’t. He might have killed her.",0
"At the sight of her son, standing between the two myrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified. “Jack,” she faltered. “Jack, what is this?” He looked up at her, his face set. “They have arrested me, mother.” “What?” She uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait.",0
"To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera. All Carton’s effects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his state of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind. That was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why should he be carrying a roll of films? I set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be developed. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of each film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my roll.",0
"“Madame Daubreuil!” I exclaimed. Poirot shook his head with a smile. “Not quite correct, my friend. She did not call herself by that name in those days. That is a picture of the notorious Madame Beroldy!” Madame Beroldy! In a flash the whole thing came back to me. The murder trial that had evoked such world-wide interest. The Beroldy Case. Some twenty years or so before the opening of the present story, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, a native of Lyons, arrived in Paris accompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter, a mere babe.",0
"But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared. The police are looking for her.” “Was she in with her daughter, do you think?” “We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.” “Has Jack Renauld been told?” “Not yet.” “It will be a terrible shock to him.” “Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.",0
"Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief “Bien, j’y serai” he rang off, and turned to me. “What do you think, mon ami?” He looked half ashamed, half excited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.” “What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?” “This morning, I understand.” I shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me. You see I was right.",0
"Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can er throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned to her. “Marthe, dear ” But the girl shook her head. “No, maman, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate. “You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder ” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you?” “Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?” “Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.” “Ah!” she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult me! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness to leave my house!” The honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought. Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand. “There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A few hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your investigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?” “Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.",0
"""You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines.",0
"Moreover, we have further proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the adjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never looked at a petticoat!” The secretary’s eyes narrowed. “Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul Renauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s some other explanation.” The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “What other explanation could there be?” “What leads you to think it was a love affair?” “Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings.",0
"One thing I am fairly sure of they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No and there ought to have been. Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots in the other, none! You see? Some one had passed that way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.” “Where did they get a rake?” “Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot impatiently. “There is no difficulty about that.” “What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, mon ami.” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas. And if some little fact will not fit in do not reject it but consider it closely. Though its significance escapes you, be sure that it is significant.” “In the meantime,” I said, considering, “although we know a great deal more than we did, we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed Mr. Renauld.” “No,” said Poirot cheerfully. “In fact we are a great deal further off.” The fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that I gazed at him in wonder. He met my eye and smiled. “But yes, it is better so. Before, there was at all events a clear theory as to how and by whose hands he met his death. Now that is all gone. We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and worry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth order. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and above-board, eh bien, méfiez vous! It is, how do you say it? cooked! The great criminal is simple but very few criminals are great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably betray themselves. Ah, mon ami, I would that some day I could meet a really great criminal one who commits his crime, and then does nothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.” But I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me. “Poirot! Mrs. Renauld! I see it now. She must be shielding somebody.” From the quietness with which Poirot received my remark, I could see that the idea had already occurred to him. “Yes,” he said thoughtfully. “Shielding some one or screening some one. One of the two.” I saw very little difference between the two words, but I developed my theme with a good deal of earnestness. Poirot maintained a strictly non-committal attitude, repeating: “It may be yes, it may be. But as yet I do not know! There is something very deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep.” Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture. We lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to present itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed maliciously: “Eh bien! And your indiscretions! You recount them not?” I felt myself blushing. “Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance. But I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so. “Tiens! A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this charming young lady?” I had to confess that I did not know. “Still more romantic! The first rencontre in the train from Paris, the second here. Journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the saying?” “Don’t be an ass, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!” “It’s all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well it sounds snobbish perhaps but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class. It never answers.” “I agree with you, mon ami. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.” His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again her voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with empressement: “I will.” Well, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had had time to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in cold blood, I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her intensely. I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her morbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again. I answered Poirot lightly enough. “She asked me to look her up, but of course I shan’t.” “Why ‘of course’?” “Well I don’t want to.” “I see.” He studied me attentively for some minutes. “Yes. I see very well. And you are wise. Stick to what you have said.” “That seems to be your invariable advice,” I remarked, rather piqued. “Ah, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.” “Thank you,” I said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “Les Anglais!” he murmured. “No method absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. “Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told me, did you not?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “True, I forgot.” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, mon ami.” “You are going to Paris? But why?” He replied very seriously. “To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.” “You think he is in Paris?” “I am quite certain that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I must look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to you in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris is necessary. I shall not be away long. In all probability I shall return tomorrow. I do not propose that you should accompany me. Remain here and keep an eye on Giraud. Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld fils. And thirdly, if you wish, endeavour to cut him out with Mademoiselle Marthe. But I fear you will not have great success.” I did not quite relish the last remark. “That reminds me,” I said. “I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?” “Mon ami I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering Léonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I decided on the latter. So I made my guess and I was right.” “And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?” Poirot smiled. “At any rate I saw that she had anxious eyes. That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes.…” His voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start.” “You’ve oceans of time.” “Perhaps perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.” “At all events,” I said, rising, “I will come and see you off.” “You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.” He was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded emphatically. “I mean it, mon ami. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it is not the English custom. Une poignee de main, alors.” I felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down the beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to join them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hôtel du Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for some time, till my impatience got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and slipped five francs into his hand. “I wish to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, small and dark. I am not sure of her name.” The man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin. “There is no such lady as you describe staying here.” “She is American possibly,” I suggested. These fellows are so stupid. But the man continued to shake his head. “No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.” “What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no intention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one’s friends can be too zealous! But where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel. Then another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more I thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I went up to the Villa Geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. I did not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by the shed, and sat there moodily enough. I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand. In a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they were approaching rapidly. A girl’s voice was speaking, a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe. “Chéri,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed.",0
"“They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look. “On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?” “Very curious,” I agreed. “And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.",0
"“It runs to the kitchens at the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and the dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic worries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant.” Poirot nodded. “Then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in the kitchen. You permit that I mount there?” “Oh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you up and introduce you; but I’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s of any use. They’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and they’ll be all lumped together.” Poirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II. “The order was given from the à la carte menu for three,” he explained. “Soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of beef, and a rice soufflé. What time? Just about eight o’clock, I should say. No, I’m afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now. Unfortunate. You were thinking of finger-prints, I suppose?” “Not exactly,” said Poirot, with an enigmatical smile. “I am more interested in Count Foscatini’s appetite. Did he partake of every dish?” “Yes; but of course I can’t say how much of each he ate. The plates were all soiled, and the dishes empty that is to say, with the exception of the rice soufflé. There was a fair amount of that left.” “Ah!” said Poirot, and seemed satisfied with the fact. As we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone: “We have decidedly to do with a man of method.” “Do you mean the murderer, or Count Foscatini?” “The latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. After imploring help and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up the telephone receiver.” I stared at Poirot. His words now and his recent inquiries gave me the glimmering of an idea. “You suspect poison?” I breathed. “The blow on the head was a blind.” Poirot merely smiled. We re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had arrived with two constables. He was inclined to resent our appearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland Yard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation. This was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The story he had to tell was a sensational one. On the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his master. They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of about forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four. Count Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man paused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted that, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed immediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on. The conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not as successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed, and that the basis of it was a threat.",0
"” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my conscience horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be acquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he was not.… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son, who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily. So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear. We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Eh bien, speaking frankly in confidence, c’est entendu can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with empressement. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot. “It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows.",0
"I had a dream a terrible dream that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn’t there and her bed hadn’t been slept in.” She looked at me appealingly. “What shall I do, Sir Eustace?” Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially. “What does Race say about it?” Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society. “I can’t find him anywhere.",0
"Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. “Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints. I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method” “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted. “But where did their ‘method’ break down?” “Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark” “I remember,” I cried. “Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!” There was a moment’s silence. “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me. “This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed. “Pas du tout,” replied Poirot tranquilly. “Japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them. But” he tapped his pocket “I have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you, my friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we return here next week-end at my expense this time?” Now that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I think I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe. One evening after dinner I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation” was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand. I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible.",0
"It will haunt me for ever!” “No, no,” I said soothingly. “Of course it’s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,” resumed Jack, “but I’d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and realized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so honestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself. I just drifted, in fact not realizing that I was driving the poor kid desperate. If she’d really knifed me, as she meant to, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she’s come forward now is downright plucky. I’d have stood the racket, you know up to the end.” He was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack: “What gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in underclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. I suppose he’d just given the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a mistake about its being 2 o’clock when they came. Or or, it wasn’t all a frame up, was it? I mean, my mother didn’t think couldn’t think that that it was me?” Poirot reassured him quickly. “No, no, M. Jack. Have no fears on that score. As for the rest, I will explain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you recount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?” “There’s very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in order to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The train was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf links. I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there. I had nearly reached the place when ” He paused and swallowed. “Yes?” “I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud a sort of choke and gasp but it frightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came round the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then and then I looked up and saw her. She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost it’s what she must have thought me at first all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot. “How would it be if you went on first to break the news to my mother that I am free ” “While you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?” finished Poirot, with a twinkle. “But yes, by all means, I was about to propose such an arrangement myself.” Jack Renauld did not wait for more. Stopping the car, he swung himself out, and ran up the path to the front door. We went on in the car to the Villa Geneviève. “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember how we arrived here that first day? And were met by the news of M. Renauld’s murder?” “Ah! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have happened since then especially for you, mon ami!” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The mise en scène designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the dénouement ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old woman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the salon. It was some time before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave. “Vous voilà, Hastings! Sacré tonnerre, but there are squalls ahead!” “What do you mean?” I cried. “I would hardly have credited it,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “but women are very unexpected.” “Here are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,” I exclaimed, looking out of the window. Poirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps outside. “Do not enter. It is better not. Your mother is very upset.” “I know, I know,” said Jack Renauld. “I must go up to her at once.” “But no, I tell you. It is better not.” “But Marthe and I ” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment.",0
"He might, of course, have cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who could have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of that note being written.” We sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: “You say that Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you heard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew? Where was Colonel Race?” “I could not find him anywhere.",0
"When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense” “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly. “I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.” I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest. “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.” “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?” “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.” “And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her. For my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject as we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest. “But yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not underrate the force of superstition.” “What are we going to do about it?” “Toujours pratique, the good Hastings! Eh bien, to begin with we are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr. Bleibner’s death.” He duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young Rupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead. A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime. The news of his uncle’s death reaches him. He realizes how unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes his own life. I outlined my solution to Poirot. He was interested. “It is ingenious what you have thought of there decidedly it is ingenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the fatal influence of the Tomb.” I shrugged my shoulders. “You still think that has something to do with it?” “So much so, mon ami, that we start for Egypt to-morrow.” “What?” I cried, astonished. “I have said it.” An expression of conscious heroism spread over Poirot’s face. Then he groaned. “But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!” It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids. The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me.",0
"It is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.” “But why?” “Because uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the Prime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the situation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will the Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive? Nobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done. And, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what les Boches are playing for.",0
"""I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.” “Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, n’est-ce pas? What it is to be young! O jeunesse, jeunesse!” And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.",0
"But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe. One evening after dinner I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation” was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies my friend and I were sitting in his rooms.

"The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice.",0
"I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station. I found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see the body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man, typically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters. “Turned away for a moment,” remarked Japp, “and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.” “What do you think of the case?” I asked, as we left the gruesome chamber behind us. “Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!” noting my exclamation of astonishment. “Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!” “Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?” Japp winked. “I think it grew pretty fast grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that we’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I’m sorry Mrs. Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.” I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question. And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst I was at breakfast the following morning: “Of course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic.” It seemed to me that Poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious. I also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case. His request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was able to. At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot: “Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.” Dumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath. “He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something in it.",0
"His accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now, for, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have been cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.” “Perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?” “Then why did he not do so? He merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing more. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the truth.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the clock, “I suppose we’d better start for the station. You may find more clues in France.” “Possibly, mon ami, but I doubt it. It is still incredible to me that the Prime Minister has not been discovered in that limited area, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous. If the military and the police of two countries have not found him, how shall I?” At Charing Cross we were met by Mr. Dodge. “This is Detective Barnes, of Scotland Yard, and Major Norman. They will hold themselves entirely at your disposal. Good luck to you. It’s a bad business, but I’ve not given up hope. Must be off now.” And the Minister strode rapidly away. We chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre of the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little ferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old acquaintance of Poirot’s Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be one of the smartest of Scotland Yard’s officers. He came over and greeted my friend cheerfully. “I heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far they’ve got away with the goods all right. But I can’t believe they can keep him hidden long. Our people are going through France with a toothcomb. So are the French. I can’t help feeling it’s only a matter of hours now.” “That is, if he’s still alive,” remarked the tall detective gloomily. Japp’s face fell. “Yes. But somehow I’ve got the feeling he’s alive all right.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, yes; he’s alive. But can he be found in time? I, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.” The whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then, with a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station. It was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together. Maps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages. Each man had his own pet theory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring in front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an amusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot’s behaviour moved me to intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat, clutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily. “Mon Dieu!” he murmured. “This is terrible!” “Have courage, Poirot,” I cried. “You will succeed. You will find him. I am sure of it.” “Ah, mon ami, you mistake my emotion. It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The mal de mer it is horrible suffering!” “Oh!” I said, rather taken aback. The first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and closed his eyes. “Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to study it?” Poirot shook his head impatiently. “But no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the stomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer. You breathe in and out slowly, so turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath.” I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck. As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.” “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.” “What?” “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.” He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending. He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?” His eyes challenged us. “But I Hercule Poirot tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within here!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot so and I say: the Prime Minister is there! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.” And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously contemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness. Finally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the window. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned for my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the daily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay alongside the quay. Suddenly I was aroused by Poirot’s voice close to my elbow. “Mes amis, let us start!” I turned. An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend. His eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to the uttermost. “I have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.” Major Norman moved hastily to the door. “I’ll order the car.” “There is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has fallen.” “Do you mean you are going to walk, sir?” “No, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea by boat.” “To cross the sea?” “Yes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And the beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return to England.” At three o’clock, we stood once more upon Charing Cross platform. To all our expostulations, Poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time, but the only way. On the way over, he had conferred with Norman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from Dover. Owing to the special passes held by Norman, we got through everywhere in record time. In London, a large police car was waiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend. He answered my inquiring glance. “A list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of London. I wired for it from Dover.” We were whirled rapidly through the London streets. We were on the Bath Road. On we went, through Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford. I began to see our objective. Through Windsor and on to Ascot. My heart gave a leap. Ascot was where Daniels had an aunt living. We were after him, then, not O’Murphy. We duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. Poirot jumped out and rang the bell. I saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face. Plainly, he was not satisfied. The bell was answered. He was ushered inside. In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into the car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to die down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence incriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were holding the Prime Minister? Our return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We deviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally stopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital. Poirot only spent a few minutes at each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored. He whispered something to Norman, to which the latter replied: “Yes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by the bridge.” We turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a second car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men in plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we started off in a northerly direction, the other car following close behind. We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds. Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke. “I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.” The girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall. “Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.” But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and poured into the house, shutting the door behind them. Norman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity. Finally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three prisoners a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were taken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by Poirot himself. “I must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this gentleman. You do not know him, no? Eh bien, let me present to you, Monsieur O’Murphy!” O’Murphy! I gaped at him open-mouthed as we started again. He was not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He sat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman and I would be more than a match for him. To my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not returning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the car slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon Aerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirot’s idea. He proposed to reach France by aeroplane. It was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A telegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave the personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others. As we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man took his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly. I, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm. “I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late if you go yourself.” Poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two. “Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram.” At that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the Flying Corps. “This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France. He can start at once.” “Wrap up warmly, sir,” said the young pilot. “I can lend you a coat, if you like.” Poirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself: “Yes, there is time just time.” Then he looked up, and bowed politely to the young officer. “I thank you, monsieur. But it is not I who am your passenger. It is this gentleman here.” He moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out of the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of surprise. It was the Prime Minister! “For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?” “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.” “What?” “I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face” “But by whom?” “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.” “Impossible!” “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.” “But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every one!” “He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life.",0
"She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost it’s what she must have thought me at first all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.",0
"“You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to find one soon, or it’s a washout.” “One more question, permettez Lady Yardly, which plan does she approve?” “Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel.",0
"He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several questions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English. Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.” “That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.” I shuddered. Then a thought struck me. “You say you didn’t know I was there. What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he did not seem to notice. “How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?” I asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. “And what are you doing in this part of the world, anyway?” “I live here,” he said simply. “On this island?” “Yes, I came here after the War. Sometimes I take parties from the hotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to live, and mostly I do as I please.” “You live here all alone?” “I am not pining for society, I assure you,” he replied coldly. “I am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,” I retorted, “but I seem to have had very little to say in the matter.” To my surprise his eyes twinkled a little. “None whatever. I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal and carried you to my boat. Quite like a primitive man of the Stone Age.” “But for a different reason,” I put in. He flushed this time, a deep burning blush. The tan of his face was suffused. “But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless disturbed had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death. No, I swore to myself that I’d take better care of you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this island. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come and look after you. She’s loyal. She’ll never say a word. I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know.” I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know! How some words please one! “You did quite right,” I said quietly. “And I shall not send word to any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn’t make much difference. It’s not as though they were my own people. They’re only acquaintances really even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must have known a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.” I managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all. “If you would be guided by me” he said, hesitating. “I don’t expect I shall be,” I answered candidly. “But there’s no harm in hearing.” “Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted. “I shouldn’t dream of marrying any one unless I was madly in love with them. And of course there is really nothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn’t like for the sake of some one she does like. And the more self-willed she is, the more she likes it.” “I’m afraid I disagree with you. The boot is on the other leg as a rule.” He spoke with a slight sneer. “Exactly,” I cried eagerly. “And that’s why there are so many unhappy marriages. It’s all the fault of the men. Either they give way to their women and then the women despise them, or else they are utterly selfish, insist on their own way and never say ‘thank you.’ Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want, and then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it. Women like to be mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated. On the other hand, men don’t really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most of the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects it, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be!” Harry laughed outright.",0
"Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest. There weren’t nearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every now and then we got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized how enormously wide they are. Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and worship you and always shall! We got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir Eustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race. Suzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn’t get much satisfaction. After dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss Pettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room. I stood there holding it. At last I opened it. It was very short: “I must see you. I dare not come to the hotel. Will you come to the clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come. The man you knew as Harry Rayburn.” My heart beat to suffocation. He was here then! Oh, I had known it I had known it all along! I had felt him near me. All unwittingly I had come to his place of retreat. I wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door. I must be careful. He was hunted down. No one must see me meet him. I stole along to Suzanne’s room. She was fast asleep. I could hear her breathing evenly. Sir Eustace? I paused outside the door of his sitting-room. Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating.",0
"“Me, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with an exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only too rare in the new generation of detectives!” Japp grinned more widely. “I don’t know,” he said. “Miller, the man who’s on this case, is a smart chap. You may be very sure he won’t overlook a footprint, or a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. He’s got eyes that see everything.” “So, mon ami,” said Poirot, “has the London sparrow. But all the same, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of Mr. Davenheim.",0
"""Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?” “No, not one.” “Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to tetanus?” “Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.” “Then we have four deaths all totally dissimilar, one heart failure, one blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.",0
"""Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock.",0
"Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.” I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question.",0
"Only one thing had been taken ‘the Western Star.’” We stared at each other the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal. Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?” “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf. “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?” “Certainly.” In about five minutes Poirot reappeared. “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.” “Who to?” “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine.",0
"” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion.",0
"le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions.",0
"Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, c’est l’Anglais! Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age.",0
"I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment maman called me from the house, and I had to go. That is all, only I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life.",0
"Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.’ Now, Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not see Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?” “Surely, Poirot,” I cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like that would murder his own father.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe anything.” “And the motive?” “Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come in to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.” “But the tramp. Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.” “And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.” “Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph.",0
"But the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate. I refer to the lining.” With a sudden grunt, the second man seized the cat from Poirot’s hand. “Oh, I forgot to introduce you,” said Japp. “Mr. Poirot, this is Mr. Burt of the United States Secret Service.” The American’s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for. He held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. Then he rose to the occasion. “Pleased to meet you,” said Mr. Burt. “After all,” murmured Poirot, “it is possible that I shall not die this time.” Coming from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism.",0
"The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",0
"""Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack.",0
"Suzanne was not nearly so enthusiastic. She has travelled a great deal of course. Besides, she is not the type that gets excited before breakfast. She snubbed me severely when I let out an enthusiastic yelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus. By the way, I should like to make it clear here and now that this story will not be a story of South Africa. I guarantee no genuine local colour you know the sort of thing half a dozen words in italics on every page. I admire it very much, but I can’t do it. In South Sea Islands, of course, you make an immediate reference to bêche-de-mer.",0
"“You are Hassan, the late Sir John Willard’s servant?” “I served my Lord Sir John, now I serve his son.” He took a step nearer to us and lowered his voice. “You are a wise one, they say, learned in dealing with evil spirits. Let the young master depart from here. There is evil in the air around us.” And with an abrupt gesture, not waiting for a reply, he strode away. “Evil in the air,” muttered Poirot. “Yes, I feel it.” Our meal was hardly a cheerful one. The floor was left to Dr. Tosswill, who discoursed at length upon Egyptian antiquities.",0
"Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy. “But it is misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. “Aqua calda certainly ought to be cold water not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair.",0
"“It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute.",0
"One must seek the truth within not without.” “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?” “That is exactly what I do mean granted the facts were placed before me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.” Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand or rather tell me where to lay my hand on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.” Poirot considered. “Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now the facts.” “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After tea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added that he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come before he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door, passed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and was never seen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.” “Pretty very pretty altogether a charming little problem,” murmured Poirot. “Proceed, my good friend.” “About a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick black moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he had an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen, and in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into the study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return. Finally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable to wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed unaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor. Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure. “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.",0
"To most people it would have been a treat but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a nice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on.",0
"Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. “Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled. Shortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot’s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring glance, Poirot nodded. “Mais, oui! I got my 500 francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I call him Giraud!” A few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face. “M. Poirot, I’ve come to say good-bye. I’m sailing for South America almost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent, and I mean to start a new life out there.” “You go alone, M. Jack?” “My mother comes with me and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He likes out of-the-way parts of the world.” “No one else goes with you?” Jack flushed. “You mean ?” “A girl who loves you very dearly who has been willing to lay down her life for you.” “How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened, could I go to her and oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?” “Les femmes they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.” “Yes, but I’ve been such a damned fool!” “So have all of us, at one time and another,” observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack’s face had hardened. “There’s something else. I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity ” “Well, then ” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice ” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella.",0
"I regret to say that at the first roll the Kilmorden gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a totally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South Kensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office. I smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room. Mrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered. “Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over with you.",0
"No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station. I found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see the body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man, typically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.",0
"“Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not not where” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying. I felt my bona fides was now quite established. “And perhaps I might get it cheap in the circumstances.” A master touch that, I thought. “Well, it’s possible. There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now servants and all that, you know.",0
"Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and her address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body. Mrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler’s gardener, who acted as caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge opening on the main road, gave evidence. About three o’clock that afternoon, a lady came to see over the house. She produced an order from the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James gave her the keys of the house. It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter. Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about something. “He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost. I thought he was taken ill.” On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the upstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as that of “Mrs. de Castina.” The police surgeon gave it as his opinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours. The Daily Budget had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the Tube had murdered the woman and afterwards committed suicide. However, as the Tube victim was dead at two o’clock, and the woman was alive and well at three o’clock, the only logical conclusion to come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each other, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in the dead man’s pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so often occur in this life. A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown” was returned, and the police (and the Daily Budget_) were left to look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out. The black silk handbag which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose change, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of a first-class ticket to London.",0
"” As usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American film star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet. Mary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their first visit to England. They had been given a great reception. Every one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful clothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great diamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the Western Star.",0
"Not a word to any one. Sir Eustace stopped. “I leave the fancy touches to your own imagination,” he remarked. “But be careful to make no mistakes.” “‘Yours for ever and ever, Anne,’ will be sufficient,” I remarked. I wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through. “That seems all right. Now the address.” I gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a consideration. He struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew, alias Minks, answered the summons. “This letter is to go immediately the usual route.",0
"But what a lot of things have happened since then especially for you, mon ami!” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning.",0
"Oh, she is a pretty one, cellela!” The old woman tossed her head scornfully. “Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.” “Voilà,” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the truth.” “Not at all,” said the examining magistrate soothingly. “We were surprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were ” he paused delicately. “Eh? It was that without doubt?” “How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was milor anglais trés riche and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one and trés chic for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter.",0
"“Why, my dear Miss Anne, there are only three trains a week. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Do you realize that you don’t arrive at the Falls until Saturday next?” “How well we shall know each other by that time,” said Mrs. Blair maliciously. “How long are you going to stay at the Falls, Sir Eustace?” “That depends,” I said cautiously. “On what?” “On how things go at Johannesburg. My original idea was to stay a couple of days or so at the Falls which I’ve never seen, though this is my third visit to Africa and then go on to Jo’burg and study the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I pose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all I hear, Jo’burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit in about a week’s time. I don’t want to study conditions in the midst of a raging revolution.” Race smiled in a rather superior manner. “I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace. There will be no great danger in Jo’burg.” The women immediately looked at him in the “What a brave hero you are” manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as Race but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it all their own way. “I suppose you’ll be there,” I said coldly. “Very possibly. We might travel together.” “I’m not sure that I shan’t stay on at the Falls a bit,” I answered non-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo’burg? He’s got his eye on Anne, I believe. “What are your plans, Miss Anne?” “That depends,” she replied demurely, copying me. “I thought you were my secretary,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. Thursday night. We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds? At last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems that she’s a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs. Blair’s cabin, she must have been reading aloud all her special articles for years to come. It seems that all along she’s been on the track of “The Man in the Brown Suit.” Apparently she didn’t spot him on the Kilmorden_ in fact, she hardly had the chance, but she’s now very busy cabling home: “How I journeyed out with the Murderer,” and inventing highly fictitious stories of “What he said to me,” etc. I know how these things are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me. And of course one of Nasby’s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won’t recognize himself. The girl’s clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she’s ferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house. She was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a deduction quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather that she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have these intuitions I’ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess but to call it a deduction is absurd. How she ever got on the staff of the Daily Budget is more than I can imagine. But she is the kind of young woman who does these things. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into my private car! I am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He might just have got off by Monday’s train. They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that says little. He’s an astute young man and he knows Africa. He’s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman and the simple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a scar, dressed in the height of European fashion. I never did quite swallow that scar. Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track. She wants the glory of discovering him for herself and the Daily Budget. Young women are very cold-blooded nowadays. I hinted to her that it was an unwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she run him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn’t like it, either, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may all be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs. Blair but she seemed quite to welcome the idea, and remarked that if I were murdered it would be really a terrific scoop for Anne! A scoop for Anne indeed! To-morrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland. The dust will be atrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also mealie bowls and baskets. I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may run amok. There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel will appeal to her. Friday evening. As I feared. Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden animals! (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia. There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals.",0
"He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite.",0
"The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction. “The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “Ça commence!” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “Mon ami, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I ” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing sergent de ville. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.” “But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I cried. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, isn’t it?” “Yes, monsieur, but ” Poirot leaned forward. “But what?” “M. Renauld was murdered this morning.” In a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with excitement. He caught the man by the shoulder. “What is that you say? Murdered? When? How?” The sergent de ville drew himself up. “I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.” “True. I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The Commissary of Police, he is without doubt within?” “Yes, monsieur.” Poirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it. “Voilà! Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The sergent de ville saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me. “This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman. “So he foresaw his own murder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come inside.” He held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M. Bex continued to talk: “The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has just finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin his interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most sympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.” “When was the crime committed?” asked Poirot. “The body was discovered this morning about nine o’clock. Madame Renauld’s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death must have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.” We had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the Villa. In the hall another sergent de ville was sitting. He rose at sight of the commissary. “Where is M. Hautet now?” inquired the latter. “In the salon, monsieur.” M. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. M. Hautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. They looked up as we entered. The commissary introduced us, and explained our presence. M. Hautet, the Juge d’Instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing dark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of caressing as he talked. Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man, with slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand. “Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished speaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?” Poirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.",0
"” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “Ça commence!” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “Mon ami, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess.

"When I had finished he said unexpectedly: “What do you know of brachycephalic heads?” I mentioned Papa. “The Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind upon your own shoulders, young woman. But it’s all pretty thin, you know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us as it stands.” “I’m perfectly aware of that.” “What d’you want, then?” “I want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.” “Can’t do that. We’ve got our own special man on it.” “And I’ve got my own special knowledge.” “What you’ve just told me, eh?” “Oh, no, Lord Nasby. I’ve still got something up my sleeve.” “Oh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl.",0
"Maltravers’ state of mind immediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not wish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.” “I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure,” replied the young soldier; “but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my people’s, I didn’t know him very well myself.” “You came down when?” “Tuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock. But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.” “You were returning to East Africa, I understand?” “Yes. I’ve been out there ever since the War a great country.” “Exactly. Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?” “Oh, I don’t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I think.” “Thank you.” Poirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “With your permission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told us all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your subconscious self.” “Psychoanalysis, what?” said Black, with visible alarm. “Oh, no,” said Poirot reassuringly. “You see, it is like this, I give you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the first one you think of. Shall we begin?” “All right,” said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy. “Note down the words, please, Hastings,” said Poirot. Then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him. “We will commence. Day.” There was a moment’s pause, and then Black replied: “Night.” As Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker. “Name,” said Poirot. “Place.” “Bernard.” “Shaw.” “Tuesday.” “Dinner.” “Journey.” “Ship.” “Country.” “Uganda.” “Story.” “Lions.” “Rook Rifle.” “Farm.” “Shot.” “Suicide.” “Elephant.” “Tusks.” “Money.” “Lawyers.” “Thank you, Captain Black. Perhaps you could spare me a few minutes in about half an hour’s time?” “Certainly.” The young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped his brow as he got up. “And now, Hastings,” said Poirot, smiling at me as the door closed behind him. “You see it all, do you not?” “I don’t know what you mean.” “Does that list of words tell you nothing?” I scrutinized it, but was forced to shake my head. “I will assist you.",0
"For instance, if the object of the murderers was revenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him. Poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air. “Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably some distance away, since they wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if ” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they were. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.” We could say no more, for the old man had joined us. “You want me for something, monsieur?” “Yes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven’t you?” “Twenty-four years, monsieur.” “And your name is ?” “Auguste, monsieur.” “I was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb. They have been planted long?” “Some time, monsieur. But of course, to keep the beds looking smart, one must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that are over, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.” “You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired. Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize ” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully. “All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study. “You think so? Eh bien, I agree with you,” said Poirot. He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “Mon Dieu! But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, mon ami. At last I am on the right track. I am still in the dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did not confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak, don’t we?” I admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language. I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind. “There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated. But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged. “She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his head towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband.",0
"Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.” “If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly. “And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.",0
"We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned. You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. Later. Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot.",0
"I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service.",0
"’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty. Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.",0
"“They were there when I went down to dinner.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case.” “Who locked up the jewel-case?” “I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.” She held it up as she spoke. The inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders. “The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the jewel-case?” “I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.” “You didn’t lock the drawer?” “No, I never do.",0
"Of course Giraud is all wrong wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not because of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all that I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts not by my leading you by the hand.",0
"It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters was sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon. Having heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his appeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate which, of course, it did. “They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M.",0
"M. Hautet addressed us: “Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.",0
"“I’d be better dead and out of it.” “I’m glad you acknowledge the debt. You can’t get out of it. I saved your life and I’m waiting for you to say ‘Thank you.’” If looks could have killed, I think he would have liked to kill me then. He pushed roughly past me. At the door he turned back, and spoke over his shoulder. “I shall not thank you now or at any other time. But I acknowledge the debt. Some day I will pay it.” He was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating like a mill race. There were no further excitements that night. I had breakfast in bed and got up late the next morning. Mrs.",0
"Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the mirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag. “That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.",0
"Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess.",0
"” Poirot paused, and then added softly: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.” “Mrs. Robinson!” I gasped. “Well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended Poirot. “Also, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, mon ami, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below armed with that excellent revolver of yours, bien entendu!” “Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm.",0
"She leaned forward, unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely set in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly. Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss. “Épatant!” he murmured. “You permit, madame?” He took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her with a little bow. “A magnificent stone without a flaw. Ah, cent tonnerres! and you carry it about with you, comme ça!” “No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it’s locked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit. We’re staying at the Magnificent, you know. I just brought it along to-day for you to see.” “And you will leave it with me, n’est-ce pas? You will be advised by Papa Poirot?” “Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot. On Friday we’re going down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly.” Her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some gossip what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California why! it came to me in a flash of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf. “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing. “We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.” “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.” Miss Marvell nodded. “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.” “But I demand pardon if I am dense, madame surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?” A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older. “I want to wear it down there.” “Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?” “That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly. I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, c’est comme ça!” Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?” “Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do either of you ever see Society Gossip?” We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly. “I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it’s really very curious” She broke off. I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud: “. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.” She stopped. “Épatant!” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first water.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?” His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it. “I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to see.” What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance. “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?” Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast. “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I’m with you there, sir. I’ve already said so to Mary. But there! She’s a woman through and through, and I guess she can’t bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.” “What nonsense, Gregory!” said Mary Marvell sharply. But she flushed angrily. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Madame, I have advised. I can do no more. C’est fini.” He bowed them both to the door. “Ah! la la,” he observed, returning. “Histoire de femmes! The good husband, he hit the nail on the head tout de même, he was not tactful! Assuredly not.” I imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously. “So I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath all this. With your permission, mon ami, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown. “Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse. “Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.” There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks. “You know?” she gasped. “How?” I smiled. “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters” “Miss Marvell? She has been here?” “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?” For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile. “That is so,” she acknowledged. “Were yours, too, left by hand by a Chinaman?” “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?” I recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened attentively. “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them something in the nature of joss-stick that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?” I shook my head. “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.” “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.” We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose. “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.” She hesitated, her hand outstretched. “Captain Hastings.” “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.” When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent. I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend. “Bien!” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves. “Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly 10th viscount, served South African War’ tout ça n’a pas d’importance ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ um, um, um, ‘has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. Clubs residences.’ Voilà, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this milord!” “What?” “Yes. I telegraphed to him.” “I thought you had washed your hands of the case?” “I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.” “And you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience. He won’t be pleased.” “Au contraire, if I preserve for him his family diamond, he ought to be very grateful.” “Then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?” I asked eagerly. “Almost a certainty,” replied Poirot placidly. “Everything points that way.” “But how” Poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand. “Not now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that ‘Peerage’ how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, method, which, as I have often told you, Hastings” “Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place. Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality. “Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too. What does it all mean?” Poirot handed him the copy of Society Gossip. “First, milord, I would ask you if these facts are substantially correct?” The peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read. “Damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “There’s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I believe. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.” “Still, the stone is known as ‘The Star of the East.’” “Well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully. Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. “What I would ask you to do, milord, is to place yourself in my hands. If you do so unreservedly, I have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.” “Then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat tales?” “Will you do as I ask you?” “Of course I will, but” “Bien! Then permit that I ask you a few questions. This affair of Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and Mr. Rolf?” “Oh, he told you about it, did he? No, there’s nothing settled.” He hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. “Might as well get the thing straight. I’ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways, Monsieur Poirot and I’m head over ears in debt but I want to pull up. I’m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten things up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf is offering me big money enough to set me on my feet again. I don’t want to do it I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the Chase but I may have to, unless” He broke off. Poirot eyed him keenly. “You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to find one soon, or it’s a washout.” “One more question, permettez Lady Yardly, which plan does she approve?” “Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. You know what women are. She’s all for this film stunt.” “I comprehend,” said Poirot.",0
"Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.” “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?” “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.” “And the real Prime Minister?” “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs. Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity. “When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” “When I began to work the right way from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a mind like mine!” The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran: “In time.” Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression. Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly. “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us. “To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.” I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp. “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.” Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply: “Be exact, my friend. What do you mean by ‘disappear’? To which class of disappearance are you referring?” “Are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” I laughed. Japp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both. “But certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First, and most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much abused ‘loss of memory’ case rare, but occasionally genuine. Third, murder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you refer to all three as impossible of execution?” “Very nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory, but some one would be sure to recognize you especially in the case of a well-known man like Davenheim. Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up against civilization.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you make one error. You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man or with himself in a figurative sense might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.” “But not you, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at me. “He couldn’t baffle you, eh, Monsieur Poirot?” Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest. “Me, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with an exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only too rare in the new generation of detectives!” Japp grinned more widely. “I don’t know,” he said. “Miller, the man who’s on this case, is a smart chap. You may be very sure he won’t overlook a footprint, or a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. He’s got eyes that see everything.” “So, mon ami,” said Poirot, “has the London sparrow. But all the same, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of Mr. Davenheim.” “Come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of details as clues?” “By no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger is they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant; one or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells” he tapped his forehead “on which one must rely. The senses mislead. One must seek the truth within not without.” “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?” “That is exactly what I do mean granted the facts were placed before me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.” Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand or rather tell me where to lay my hand on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.” Poirot considered. “Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now the facts.” “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After tea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added that he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come before he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door, passed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and was never seen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.” “Pretty very pretty altogether a charming little problem,” murmured Poirot. “Proceed, my good friend.” “About a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick black moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he had an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen, and in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into the study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return. Finally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable to wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed unaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor. Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure. “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment. “On Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light. Behind a portière in Mr. Davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that safe had been broken into and rifled. The windows were fastened securely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having intervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is likely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained undetected until Monday.” “Précisément,” said Poirot dryly. “Well, is he arrested, ce pauvre M. Lowen?” Japp grinned. “Not yet. But he’s under pretty close supervision.” Poirot nodded. “What was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?” “We’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large transaction having been just carried through. There was also a small fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim’s jewels were kept in the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem.” “Altogether a good haul,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Now, what about Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that evening?” “Well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen is a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been able once or twice to score a coup off Davenheim in the market, though it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter concerning some South American shares which led the banker to make his appointment.” “Had Davenheim interests in South America, then?” “I believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in Buenos Ayres.” “Any trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good terms?” “I should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful. Mrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a nonentity, I think.” “Then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had he any enemies?” “He had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular good-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him and, if they had, where is the body?” “Exactly. As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency.” “By the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French window of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a good way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot fix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as the gardeners cease work at that time.” “And Mr. Davenheim left the house?” “About half-past five or thereabouts.” “What lies beyond the rose-garden?” “A lake.” “With a boathouse?” “Yes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you’re thinking of suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don’t mind telling you that Miller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged. That’s the kind of man he is!” Poirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “Hastings, I pray you, hand me that copy of the Daily Megaphone. If I remember rightly, there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.” I rose, and found the sheet required. Poirot studied the features attentively. “H’m!” he murmured. “Wears his hair rather long and wavy, full moustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?” “Yes.” “Hair and beard turning grey?” The detective nodded. “Well, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to say to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?” “On the contrary, most obscure.” The Scotland Yard man looked pleased. “Which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished Poirot placidly. “Eh?” “I find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear as daylight eh bien, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.” Japp shook his head almost pityingly. “Well, each to their fancy. But it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.” “I do not see,” murmured Poirot. “I shut my eyes and think.” Japp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.” “And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?” “Certainly. That’s in the bargain.” “Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. “Like robbing a child!” I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room. “Eh bien!” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?” He shook his finger at me. “You do not trust his grey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.",0
"“Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little salon.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say ” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us.",0
"One to be carried out if my interview there was unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That is, if I had the nerve to go through with it. Things that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily tackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect, I walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby. Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the Daily Budget. He owned other papers several of them, but the Daily Budget was his special child. It was as the owner of the Daily Budget that he was known to every householder in the United Kingdom.",0
"Davenheim left the house?” “About half-past five or thereabouts.” “What lies beyond the rose-garden?” “A lake.” “With a boathouse?” “Yes, a couple of punts are kept there.

Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.” “The lake!” I said significantly. “And even more than the lake, the boathouse!” I looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to question him further. We heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he walked in about nine o’clock. I saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind. “Eh bien, my friend,” remarked Poirot. “All goes well? But do not tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in your lake, because I shall not believe you.” “We haven’t found the body, but we did find his clothes the identical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to that?” “Any other clothes missing from the house?” “No, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his wardrobe is intact. There’s more.",0
"I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?” I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs.",0
"I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got lots of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.",0
"What the devil does any one want to work for on board ship? It is true that I promised my publishers my “Reminiscences” early in the summer, but what of it? Who really reads reminiscences? Old ladies in the suburbs. And what do my reminiscences amount to? I’ve knocked against a certain number of so-called famous people in my lifetime. With the assistance of Pagett, I invent insipid anecdotes about them. And, the truth of the matter is, Pagett is too honest for the job. He won’t let me invent anecdotes about the people I might have met but haven’t. I tried kindness with him. “You look a perfect wreck still, my dear chap,” I said easily. “What you need is a deck-chair in the sun. No not another word.",0
"She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine for all the world as though she’d been running a race and yet Pagett told me that he’d seen her off to Durban last night! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body. And she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, “Secretaries I have had.” No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once. No.",0
"This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied. The Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind him. I was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen my hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from crying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the house, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below I heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was going out. It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again at my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still roll. Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy. Besides being extremely painful, since I could not guard my face with my arms, it was also exceedingly difficult to keep any particular direction. I tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go. In the end, however, I came right up against my objective. It almost touched my bound hands. Even then it was not easy. It took an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long heart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I succeeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out. Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time.",0
"Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly.",0
"""But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked Poirot gently. “Yes.” The young man stared at him in a puzzled manner. “You do not catch my meaning, I see,” said Poirot, smiling enigmatically. “Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank.” Ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it. “Send this in and my uncle will see you at once.” Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the London and Scottish Bank.",0
"“There’s something very queer about all this,” he said. “To begin with, where is Rayburn?” It’s perfectly true that we haven’t seen the fellow since we came on shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however. Altogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter. I can’t take him about with me in his present condition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray’s billet-doux, but I shall not take Pagett with me.",0
"Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman.",0
"In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform. A porter tried to stop me, but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the footboard. I mounted the two steps and opened the gate. I was safe! The train was gathering way. We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I waved to him. “Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,” I shouted. Never have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he had seen a ghost. In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor.",0
"Even to Pagett. I happened to hear that he or rather Mrs. Pagett had brought a sixth child into the world the other day. England will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the child a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness to act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post card straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face! Bless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you have made in not marrying me. Yours ever, Eustace Pedler. Harry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not see eye to eye.",0
"But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr.",0
"And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa.",0
"I believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!” “Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!” “Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.” The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly. “Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,” explained the latter. “Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion.",0
"Hautet and say that we will come at once.” Poirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But when he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. “He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly. We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M.",0
"All the world’s before you love, life, everything. Mine’s behind me scorched, spoiled, with a taste of bitter ashes.” “If you don’t want me” “You know I want you. You know that I’d give my soul to pick you up in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for ever and ever. And you’re tempting me, Anne. You, with your long witch’s hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green and never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I’ll save you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night. You shall go to Beira” “I’m not going to Beira,” I interrupted. “You are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself and throw you on to the boat. What do you think I’m made of? Do you think I’ll wake up night after night, fearing they’ve got you? One can’t go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back to England, Anne and and marry and be happy.” “With a steady man who’ll give me a good home!” “Better that than utter disaster.” “And what of you?” His face grew grim and set. “I’ve got my work ready to hand. Don’t ask what it is. You can guess, I dare say. But I’ll tell you this I’ll clear my name, or die in the attempt, and I’ll choke the life out of the damned scoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.” “We must be fair,” I said. “He didn’t actually push me over.” “He’d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge. He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story. “You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia.",0
"For instance, the night he tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden, he says he followed Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down. Now we know that’s not true.” “No,” said Suzanne unwillingly. “But we only heard the story at second-hand from Sir Eustace. If we’d heard it direct from Pagett himself, it might have been different. You know how people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.” I turned the thing over in my mind. “No,” I said at last, “I don’t see any way out. Pagett’s guilty.",0

The work must wait.” The next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin. “There’s no room to work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It’s full of trunks.” From his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles, something that had no business to be there. I explained to him that, though he might not be aware of the fact, it was usual to take a change of clothing with one when travelling. He gave the wan smile with which he always greets my attempts at humour, and then reverted to the business in hand. “And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes” he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?” Sarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us. He seems to regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand, regard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful. “We’ll get an extra cabin,” I said hastily. The thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?” “The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,” replied Pagett seriously. “But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there’s something very queer about that cabin.” Memories of reading The Upper Berth floated through my mind. “If you mean that it’s haunted,” I said, “we’re not going to sleep there, so I don’t see that it matters. Ghosts don’t affect typewriters.” Pagett said that it wasn’t a ghost, and that, after all, he hadn’t got Cabin 17. He told me a long, garbled story. Apparently he, and a Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come to blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and Pagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter. “Both 13 and 28 are better cabins,” he reiterated. “But they wouldn’t look at them.” “Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look.",0
"He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred.",0
"Marthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack, and she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with the other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine rather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the truth he will be horrified revolted, and his false love will wither away.” “What about Giraud?” “He has a crise of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to return to Paris.” We both smiled. Poirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot who broke it to him.",0
"I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out. “Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the affair at the Villa Geneviève?’ “Yes,” I said eagerly.",0
"We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your father? A very interesting man on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head. Had he been pumping me? Were those slight inaccuracies just tests to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) There is something to be said for life on board ship. It is peaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar. What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him. On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent Bridge players and one decent-looking woman Mrs. Clarence Blair. I’ve met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her, and should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn ass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her. He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work.",0
"I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind.",0
"""A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty. Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm. “You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile. “I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question. “What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen, Mr. Ridgeway?” He laughed rather bitterly. “The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.” “But I understood that it had been opened with a key?” “That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t. And, in the end, they must have got it unlocked somehow or other.” “Curious,” said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light I knew so well. “Very curious! They waste much, much time trying to prise it open, and then sapristi! they find that they have the key all the time for each of Hubbs’s locks are unique.” “That’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. It never left me day or night.” “You are sure of that?” “I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?” “Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?” Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated apologetically. “Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?” “Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!” “And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?” “Certainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on board and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the Olympia’s arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the Olympia got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.” “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?” “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.” “But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked Poirot gently. “Yes.” The young man stared at him in a puzzled manner. “You do not catch my meaning, I see,” said Poirot, smiling enigmatically. “Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank.” Ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it. “Send this in and my uncle will see you at once.” Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the London and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven.",0
"” The inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness. Célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Then, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to work to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards, completely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked on sceptically. “You really think you will find them?” “Yes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadn’t time to take them out of the room.",0
"It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House.",0
"The dust will be atrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also mealie bowls and baskets. I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may run amok. There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel will appeal to her. Friday evening. As I feared. Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden animals! (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia. There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter. I imitated her example most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out. We talked half the night. It had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted as well as aggressive ones. Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his party, I was fairly safe. Both he and Colonel Race were powerful protectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to stir up a hornet’s nest about my ears. Also, as long as I was near Sir Eustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious “Colonel.” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight.",0
"When she actually came forward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And yet I was not satisfied, mon ami. I was not satisfied.… “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before. If it was not Bella Duveen, the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one single proof against her! “And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea since, as she thought, it belonged to her sister. But if, by any chance, it was not her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings (it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told her as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out (according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession! “In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open. By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a desperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted that I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions and failed!” “What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle. We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike. Even I did not suspect triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, mon ami! On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle.",0
"I dare say it’s only a silly hoax Gregory says so but it’s just worrying me to death.” She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement. “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.” “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot. The latter scrutinized them closely. “Cheap paper the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure. I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.",0
"“A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things. That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly ” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.” “You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile. “But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping.” “Who is that?” “Madame Daubreuil,” said the detective dryly. “Eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have heard about that, have you?” “I hear everything,” said Giraud imperturbably. “There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,” said M.",0
"Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I’m tired of secretaries, I won’t have any more secretaries. Either they’re concealed murderers or else they’re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have.",0
"“Amen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time. But this is dark dark. I cannot see.” “Well, Poirot,” I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the Ministers, “what do you think?” My friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft movements. He shook his head thoughtfully. “I do not know what to think. My brains desert me.” “Why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do as well?” I mused. “Pardon me, mon ami, but I did not quite say that.",0
"I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married even to Clarence!” I disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all. Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.” “But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow. She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow. What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry.",0
"His manner towards me had changed, moreover. It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat ill upon him, and which nauseated me. The man was an oily hypocrite. First he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments! Did he imagine for one minute that I hadn’t recognized him that night on the boat? No, it was a pose, a pose which he forced me to acquiesce in, his tongue in his cheek all the while. Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment I had a two-berth one to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the train would start. But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well. She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him. She is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow. Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me. I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face.",0
"I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery.",0
"Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife. So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can simulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating type as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him, but separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to separate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack the heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and at a stroke she will attain wealth not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil the dagger! Jack Renauld had three souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans. “(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that she might have killed M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because, as I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one finds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very likely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir paper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all the time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld.",0
"He still seemed to be thinking. “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.” “But the maid did!” “Why do you say that?” “Why,” I stammered, “they were found actually in her mattress.” “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.",0
"“You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett” “And you?” That was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the Kilmorden, or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat.",0
"""Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?” “So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.” “Well, let us pass from that.” “Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?” “I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.” “I do not see that you can fix that definitely unless you question Mademoiselle Dabreuil again.” “There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see nothing, Hastings!” I looked at him for a moment. “Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being in the other’s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.” A faint smile crossed Poirot’s lips. “You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and what is more send his son there?” “It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.” Poirot shook his head. “My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up. The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably deeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and here the words that he used are significant.” “‘Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now,’” I repeated. “They seem to me a little vehement, perhaps, that is all.” “That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why? Not only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.” “Why should it be?” I asked, bewildered. “That is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wrist watch which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more. Now, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I place the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.” I stared at him, stupefied. “But how? Why? How can you possibly know?” “Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained. Mon ami, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do you not now see what is so glaringly plain?” “My dear Poirot, I can’t see anything glaring about it. I did think I was beginning to see my way before, but I’m now hopelessly fogged.” Poirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. “Mon Dieu! But it is triste! A good intelligence and so deplorably lacking in method. There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells. I will impart it to you ” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, ne vous impatientez pas! I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, mon ami, let me ask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?” “Georges Conneau,” I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily. “Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that was Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as Georges Conneau is not Jack Renauld, follows that the third case is put out of court.",0
"""I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.” “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway” “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.” “Who is his uncle?” “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.” “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?” “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.” “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty. Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm. “You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished.",0
"“I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took the path to the bridge. I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge. But the minutes passed, and no one came. I had not been followed. I turned and took the path to the clearing. I took six paces or so and then stopped. Something had rustled behind me. It could not be any one who had followed me from the hotel. It was some one who was already here, waiting. And immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of instinct, I knew that it was I myself who was threatened. It was the same feeling as I had had on the Kilmorden that night a sure instinct warning me of danger. I looked sharply over my shoulder. Silence. I moved on a pace or two. Again I heard that rustle. Still walking, I looked over my shoulder again. A man’s figure came out of the shadow. He saw that I saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track. It was too dark to recognize anybody. All I could see was that he was tall, and a European, not a native. I took to my heels and ran. I heard him pounding behind. I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed on the white stones that showed me where to step, for there was no moon that night. And suddenly my foot felt nothingness. I heard the man behind me laugh, an evil, sinister laugh. It rang in my ears, as I fell headlong down down down to destruction far beneath. I came to myself slowly and painfully. I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out. Then dreams again long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him warn him what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger some great danger and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. By some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and aching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me.",0
"We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.",0
"” We established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested, looking out to sea. From farther along the sand, the cries of the bathers reached us faintly. The sea was of the palest blue, and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my own good spirits, and Poirot’s suggestion that I was “fey.” What a long time seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only three days! “Think, my friend,” said Poirot’s voice encouragingly. “Arrange your ideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.",0
"But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, mon ami, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air.",0
"an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl. What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there. I had a dream a terrible dream that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn’t there and her bed hadn’t been slept in.” She looked at me appealingly. “What shall I do, Sir Eustace?” Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially. “What does Race say about it?” Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society. “I can’t find him anywhere.” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.",0
"Renauld will don the tramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave, unnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him. “You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella. Every moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon as he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression that the assassins left that way. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two years ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall upon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same story as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the mind against originality. The night is chilly, and he slips on an overcoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave with the dead man. He goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower bed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence against himself. He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he digs and then ” “Yes?” “And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.… Now, Hastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of two crimes. The first crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to investigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged Hercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to solve that will be difficult since the criminal in his wisdom, has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by M. Renauld. It has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young hand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology, is almost certain to fail.” “You’re marvellous, Poirot,” I said, with admiration. “Absolutely marvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!” I think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost embarrassed. “Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound?” His term for Giraud never failed to make me smile. “Rather. You’ve scored over him handsomely.” “That poor Giraud,” said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest. “Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had la mauvaise chance once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for instance. To say the least, it was misleading.” “To tell you the truth, Poirot,” I said slowly, “even now I don’t quite see whose hair was it?” “Madame Renauld’s of course. That is where la mauvaise chance came in. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered. It might just as easily have been a grey hair and then, by no conceivable effort could Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack Renauld! But it is all of a piece. Always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man and a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case? I will tell you it does not fit in, and so we shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of working? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy balloon swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he despises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon comme ça!” And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he resumed: “Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak. The possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the Anzora? Ah! voilà une femme, Hastings! What force, what self-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: ‘It does not matter now.’ And no one noticed no one realized the significance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play, poor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and, instead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now. No wonder she fainted! But since then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has played her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son’s sake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the criminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s past life. ‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was perfect, the indulgent tone, the soupçon of sad mockery. At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great woman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!” Poirot lost himself in contemplation. “One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?” “You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be unrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track. And that imbecile of a Giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends! Did I not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a clue of two inches?” “Well, Giraud will sing small now,” I observed hastily, to lead the conversation away from my own shortcomings. “As I said before, will he? If he has arrived at the right person by the wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.” “But surely ” I paused as I saw the new trend of things. “You see, Hastings, we must now start again. Who killed M. Renauld? Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night, some one who would benefit by his death the description fits Jack Renauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point. “Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There were two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological heredity, mon ami, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?” “About five, I believe.” “That will do very well. We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why?” “To find a possible witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right especially with the help of this.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella. For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch. All is well the sea it will be calm!” In the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on board the boat, secure from Poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I pulled myself together, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much. What kept her there the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas en route to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the Anzora had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I could not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to him, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do. Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London was uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, mon ami. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way. “There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming genially. “Eh bien, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.” “Bella Duveen. I know the name, but for the moment I can’t place it. What’s her line?” “That I do not know but here is her photograph.” Mr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted. “Got it!” He slapped his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “That’s it. They’re sisters. Acrobats, dancers and singers. Give quite a good little turn. They’re in the provinces somewhere, I believe if they’re not resting. They’ve been on in Paris for the last two or three weeks.” “Can you find out for me exactly where they are?” “Easy as a bird. You go home, and I’ll send you round the dope in the morning.” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening. The show was wearisome beyond words or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so. Japanese families balanced themselves precariously, would-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely slicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout prima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian endeavoured to be Mr. George Robey and failed signally. At last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids. My heart beat sickeningly. There she was there they both were, the pair of them, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short fluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. They looked a pair of extremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh and true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive. It was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some clever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and catchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause. Evidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success. Suddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the air. I suggested leaving to Poirot. “Go by all means, mon ami. I amuse myself, and will stay to the end.",0
"I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",0
"He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly. “I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track and, my God! that’s the place to know a friend. There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death could have broken. Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were crowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles. I can’t tell you our elation. It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.” “Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then in the hotel at Kimberley we met her” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard.",0
"He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!” I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head.",0
"""Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I’m an actress. No not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six tumbling.” “I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled. “Haven’t you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I understand.” “I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now ” “We?” “My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in.",0
"My Romantic Wedding was given a halo of publicity. My son is lying in the sun, kicking his legs. There’s a “man in a brown suit” if you like. He’s wearing as little as possible, which is the best costume for Africa, and is as brown as a berry. He’s always burrowing in the earth. I think he takes after Papa. He’ll have that same mania for Pleiocene clay. Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.” Strangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion. Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess! It was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective, Hercule Poirot. The Calais express was singularly empty in fact, my own compartment held only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace. “Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an imaginary audience. “I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but Oh, Lord, there’s reason enough for it! Do you know I’ve lost my only sister?” “Really?” I said politely. “How unfortunate.” “He disapproves!” remarked the lady. “He disapproves utterly of me, and my sister which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!” I opened my mouth, but she forestalled me. “Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo! I am crushed!” She buried herself behind a large comic French paper.",0
"I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.",0
"The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have further proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the adjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never looked at a petticoat!” The secretary’s eyes narrowed. “Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul Renauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s some other explanation.” The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “What other explanation could there be?” “What leads you to think it was a love affair?” “Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! mon Dieu! What else could it be?” “Blackmail,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor. “The old man was being bled and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet. “Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it. What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M. Renauld?” “Over a year?” “Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?” “I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.” “In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?” “Absolutely.” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face.",0
"The suggestion was infamous! That she should be suspected of robbing Madame! The police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible! But Monsieur, who was a Frenchman “A Belgian,” interjected Poirot, but Célestine paid no attention to the correction. Monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. She had never liked her a bold, red-faced thing a born thief. She had said from the first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on her it would be very surprising! Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, Célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily. “If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie!” she declared heatedly. “I never so much as saw them.” “Search her!” screamed the other. “You will find it is as I say.” “You’re a liar do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon her. “Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again. I’d be glad if the police would search me. I’ve nothing to be afraid of.” At this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to it. His face brightened when he saw who it was. “Ah!” he said. “That’s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our female searchers, and she’s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldn’t mind going into the room next door.” He looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head, the searcher following her closely. The French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking round the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a sketch. [A sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor.] “Where does that door lead?” he inquired, nodding his head towards the one by the window. “Into the next apartment, I believe,” said the inspector. “It’s bolted, anyway, on this side.” Poirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and tried it again. “And on the other side as well,” he remarked. “Well, that seems to rule out that.” He walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn. “And again nothing.",0
"” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.” “It may be as you say. Now, M. Poirot, you would without doubt like to visit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been removed, but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available.” “I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.” The commissary rose. “Come with me, monsieurs.” He opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him. Poirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary. “Monsieur.” “Monsieur.” At last they got out into the hall. “That room there, it is the study, hein?” asked Poirot suddenly, nodding towards the door opposite. “Yes. You would like to see it?” He threw the door open as he spoke, and we entered. The room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was small, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike writing desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large leather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a round table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves lined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window there was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains and portière were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward, passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, mon ami! And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. “The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “Bien,” said Bex. “This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk. “Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.” Poirot laughed. “The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘Tiens! The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room must have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn up, and scattered on the floor. This morning ” But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell. Françoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove of course! What else? With a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her. Then, his face lightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the dead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was but how did you know?” “By this. I found it on the back of the leather chair.” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth.",0
"to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.” About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street. “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked.",0
"“At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.” Pagett retired. “By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair’s?” “Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur hats, I think.” “That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They are hats of a kind though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them. I dare say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What else was there?” “Some rolls of films and some baskets a lot of baskets” “There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.",0
"Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs. I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction. I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue. I had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor. The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven. The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a cupboard. My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to the lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite window. At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find! I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking. It was just as dusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three days that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any length of time, it would have been thickly coated. Who had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films. I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously. Was the smell of moth balls becoming an obsession with me? I could swear that the roll of films smelt of it also? I held them under my nose. They had, as usual, a strong smell of their own, but apart from that I could clearly detect the odour I disliked so much.",0
"When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening.",0
"“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.",0
"“Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll.” When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke. “It is as well, mon ami, that we have no affairs of moment on hand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.” “What investigation are you talking about?” “The remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new flat.” “Poirot, you are not serious!” “I am most serious.",0
"Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.",0
"“You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way. “There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming genially. “Eh bien, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.” “Bella Duveen. I know the name, but for the moment I can’t place it. What’s her line?” “That I do not know but here is her photograph.” Mr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted. “Got it!” He slapped his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “That’s it. They’re sisters. Acrobats, dancers and singers. Give quite a good little turn. They’re in the provinces somewhere, I believe if they’re not resting. They’ve been on in Paris for the last two or three weeks.” “Can you find out for me exactly where they are?” “Easy as a bird. You go home, and I’ll send you round the dope in the morning.” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening. The show was wearisome beyond words or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so. Japanese families balanced themselves precariously, would-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely slicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout prima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian endeavoured to be Mr. George Robey and failed signally. At last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids. My heart beat sickeningly. There she was there they both were, the pair of them, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short fluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. They looked a pair of extremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh and true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive. It was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some clever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and catchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause. Evidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success. Suddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the air. I suggested leaving to Poirot. “Go by all means, mon ami. I amuse myself, and will stay to the end. I will rejoin you later.” It was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I understood everything understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last my own heart.… “Yes,” I said gently. “Is he looking for me?” she half whispered. Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big chair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping. I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair back from her face. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know I know everything.” “Oh, but you don’t!” “I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked: “It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action. “Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr.",0
"""I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves that sort of thing.” “If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.” “I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.” “Ah, that reminds me what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a secretary?” And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly.",0
"“You do not trust his grey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.” “The lake!” I said significantly. “And even more than the lake, the boathouse!” I looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to question him further. We heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he walked in about nine o’clock. I saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind. “Eh bien, my friend,” remarked Poirot.",0
"""I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The ‘Colonel’ is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.” “I am not afraid of him,” she laughed. “There is only one man I have ever feared and he is dead.” The man looked at her curiously. “Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,” he remarked lightly. “What do you mean?” cried the dancer sharply. The Count looked slightly surprised. “I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,” he explained. “A foolish joke.” She gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war.",0
"What frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us some one he recognized.” “You didn’t see any one?” “No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.” “Nothing unusual in that,” said the inspector dryly. “But he wasn’t a doctor.” “What?” “He wasn’t a doctor,” I repeated. “How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?” “It’s difficult to say, exactly. I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies.",0
"“Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course.",0
"He looked at me. “You’ve made a mistake, I think,” he said, smiling. “Oh, no,” I said. “I’m sure I haven’t.” “You’ve given me the wrong roll. This is an unexposed one.” I walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is good for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be! But nobody relishes the process. And then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices, I came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of one of the company’s boats, and it was labelled “Kenilworth Castle.” A wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went in. I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this time!) I murmured: “Kilmorden Castle?” “On the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?” “How much is it?” “First class, eighty-seven pounds” I interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly the amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket. “First class,” I said. I was now definitely committed to the adventure.  (Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.) It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace. I am a man who likes a quiet life. I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved. I hate being involved. All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral. Guy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working fellow, admirable in every respect. I know no one who annoys me more. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to get rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face. He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for them. I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and airily trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously. That is what makes him so difficult to live with. Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence. He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there. “My dear fellow,” I cried, “you shall go to-morrow. I will pay all your expenses.” January isn’t the usual time for going to Florence, but it would be all one to Pagett. I could imagine him going about, guide-book in hand, religiously doing all the picture galleries. And a week’s freedom was cheap to me at the price. It has been a delightful week. I have done everything I wanted to, and nothing that I did not want to do. But when I blinked my eyes open, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at the unearthly hour of 9 a.m. this morning, I realized that freedom was over. “My dear fellow,” I said, “has the funeral already taken place, or is it for later in the morning?” Pagett does not appreciate dry humour. He merely stared. “So you know, Sir Eustace?” “Know what?” I said crossly. “From the expression of your face I inferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred this morning.” Pagett ignored the sally as far as possible. “I thought you couldn’t know about this.” He tapped the telegram. “I know you dislike being aroused early but it is nine o’clock” Pagett insists on regarding 9 a.m. as practically the middle of the day “and I thought that under the circumstances” He tapped the telegram again. “What is that thing?” I asked. “It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been murdered in your house.” That aroused me in earnest. “What colossal cheek,” I exclaimed. “Why in my house? Who murdered her?” “They don’t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once, Sir Eustace?” “You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?” “The police” “What on earth have I to do with the police?” “Well, it was your house.” “That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.” Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily. “It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he remarked lugubriously. I don’t see why it should have and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily. Again I believe he is right. If it is disreputable to have a woman murdered in your house, it becomes more disreputable if the woman is a foreigner. Another idea struck me. “Good heavens,” I exclaimed, “I hope this won’t upset Caroline.” Caroline is the lady who cooks for me. Incidentally she is the wife of my gardener. What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but she is an excellent cook. James, on the other hand, is not a good gardener but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to live in solely on account of Caroline’s cooking.",0
"“Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.",0
"It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly.",0
"Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.” I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly: “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!” I looked at him coldly. On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress.",0
"He was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple, and was easily the best-looking man on board. When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my attractive woman was. “That’s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair. You must have read about her in the papers.” I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention.",0
"“Ah, sacré! But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse! Ce pauvre Japp! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we three! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I, who would not rob a child mille tonnerres! Mon ami, what have you, that you laugh so heartily?” Poirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near neighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession.",0
"So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it.",0
"“Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,” he went on. “Minks is a fool. A clever actor but a fool. That was Minks you saw downstairs.” “Oh, really,” I said feebly. “And now,” said Sir Eustace cheerfully, “let’s get down to facts. How long have you known that I was the ‘Colonel’?” “Ever since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace nodded ruefully. “Yes, I told the fool he’d blinking well torn it. He didn’t understand of course. His whole mind was set on whether I’d recognized him. It never occurred to him to wonder what I was doing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was.",0
"To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.” “Lady Yardly?” “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance. But au fond, he is very business-like, ce monsieur! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of ‘the Western Star’ struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly prepares to range himself to settle down. And then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be discovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory Rolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising to arrange all and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have £50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs” “But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected. “I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!” “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity. “I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!” I pondered the matter. “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. Bonne mère, très femme!” “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.” “Pas du tout,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that you, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.” “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung. “Si, si, mon ami, it is a pity that you study not the psychology. She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!” “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!” “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.” “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.” “Mon Dieu! but how you enrage yourself for nothing, mon ami!” “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself! I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise. “A la bonne heure, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.” “You are called away on a case, then?” “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.” “Yes?” I said, much interested. “There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last the day before yesterday the body of Mr. Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably. Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.” About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street. “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked. “First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.” The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell. We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner. Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind. “Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?” “You consider him a rich man, doctor?” The doctor looked rather surprised. “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.” “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly. The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly. “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.” “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?” “My dear sir, I never attended him.” “What?” “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist or something of that kind.” “But you examined the body?” “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.” “And the cause of death was clear?” “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.” “Was he still lying where he had been found?” “Yes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.” “No question of his having been shot, eh?” “My dear sir!” “I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!” “You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,” said Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing further” We took the hint. “Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?” “Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.” And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces. “And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor. “Rather an old ass.” “Exactly. Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.” I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly: “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!” I looked at him coldly. On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold. “Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered. “Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy.” Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth. “It is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? But must I be bothered now so soon?” “Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the Company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have empowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you. Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?” “I was changing for tea when my maid came up one of the gardeners had just run to the house. He had found” Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically. “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?” “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.” “Shooting rooks, eh?” “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.” “Where is this little rook rifle now?” “In the hall, I think.” She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily. “Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see” He paused delicately. “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head. The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us. “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?” She shook her head. “Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.” “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.” “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was only too right!” Tears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together. “Eh bien, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears to be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet” “Yet what?” “A slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not? Still, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own life there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood. No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and above-board but who is this?” A tall young man was striding up the drive towards us.",0
"I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he’s come back!” Her voice died away in a gurgle. “Lights,” said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic. “That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window. A bad night but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.” “You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did not observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see nothing!” “Well, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black’s story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally ingenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter view. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered. “No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.” “Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said. “Let us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband’s financial débâcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that the young soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that was last night!’ she observes. ‘Could a man shoot himself in such a way? Do show me if it is possible!’ The poor fool he shows her. He places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and puts her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. ‘And now, sir,’ she says saucily, ‘supposing I pull the trigger?’ “And then and then, Hastings she pulls it!”  So far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot’s investigations have started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case.",0
"And, still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is equally so. So we are forced to the second that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “Bien! Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but ” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love.” I shook my head perplexed. “Mais, oui, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so dearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?” I stared dumbfounded. “Her husband?” I gasped. Poirot nodded. “Her husband or Georges Conneau, whichever you like to call him.” I rallied myself. “But it’s impossible.” “How ‘impossible?’ Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was in a position to blackmail Georges Conneau?” “Yes, but ” “And did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld?” “That may be true enough, but ” “And is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld’s youth and upbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?” “All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.” “What is it, my friend?” “Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!” “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot placidly, “that is just what he did do!” In a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition. “It seems strange to you, mon ami, that a man should plan his own death? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you he did not intend to die.” I shook my head, bewildered. “But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told you, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a different angle. “Georges Conneau flies from justice to Canada. There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts, takes him to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the one person who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold mine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to take advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds him heavily. “And then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the beautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That rouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father’s past, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will. How they meant to manage the body business originally, I do not know possibly an art student’s skeleton and a fire or something of the kind, but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their hands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the garden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and suddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M. Renauld calls his wife. Together they drag him into the shed as we know, the event had occurred just outside and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no resemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French type. That is sufficient. “I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot from the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The identification must rest solely on Madame Renauld’s evidence. Jack Renauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must be got out of the way. It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters was sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon. Having heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his appeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate which, of course, it did. “They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M. Renauld’s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to take them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame Renauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart. That night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then, taking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground where he knows a how do you call it? bunkair? is to be made. It is essential that the body should be found Madame Daubreuil must have no suspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as to identity will be greatly lessened. Then, M. Renauld will don the tramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave, unnoticed, by the 12:10 train.",0
"""That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They are hats of a kind though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them. I dare say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What else was there?” “Some rolls of films and some baskets a lot of baskets” “There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.” “I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves that sort of thing.” “If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.” “I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.” “Ah, that reminds me what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a secretary?” And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly. But it was too late. Pagett was on the war-path. He next proceeded to bore me with a long pointless story about the Kilmorden. It was about a roll of films and a wager. The roll of films being thrown through a porthole in the middle of the night by some steward who ought to have known better. I hate horse-play. I told Pagett so, and he began to tell me the story all over again. He tells a story extremely badly, anyway. It was a long time before I could make head or tail of this one. I did not see him again until lunch-time. Then he came in brimming over with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent. I never have cared for bloodhounds. The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. “What?” I cried, startled. Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the street. Pagett had followed him. “And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!” “What?” “Yes, Sir Eustace. And that’s not all. I’ve been making inquiries about her” “Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?” “He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop” I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly. “Nothing,” I said. “Go on.” “I waited outside for ages but they didn’t come out. At last I went in. Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop! There must be another way out.” I stared at him. “As I was saying, I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries about Miss Pettigrew.” Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard as he always does when he wants to be confidential. “Sir Eustace, a man was seen coming out of her room last night.” I raised my eyebrows. “And I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability,” I murmured. Pagett went on without heeding.",0
"My maid remains in the room till I come up, so there’s no need.” The inspector’s face grew graver. “Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then the maid has not left the room?” Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French.",0
"""So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.",0
"Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.” “Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?” “So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.” “Well, let us pass from that.” “Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?” “I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.",0
"You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What beau temps, is it not? Good day, milord.” And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands. “Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?” “No, mon ami, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.” “How did you get the diamond.” “From Mr. Rolf.” “Rolf?” “Mais oui! The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in Society Gossip, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike bah! they did not exist.",0
"He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, c’est l’Anglais! Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was neatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an expensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on his left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up, black and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning! “I’m expecting the doctor any minute,” explained Giraud. “Although we hardly need him. There’s no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed to the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.” “When was it done? Last night?” Giraud shook his head. “Hardly. I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well ” I felt flustered. “I I assumed it.” “Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, mon petit does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here and here ” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have been careful to obliterate them but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?” “Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable. Also, by this ” And, leaning forward, he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see. It was a woman’s long black hair similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. Eh bien, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud.",0
"The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken since you were in Florence at the time. And yet” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where er where” “ did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow.",0
"By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow. We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed. Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty. “Sacré!” cried Poirot angrily. “Some one has been before us.” We examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment of what we sought. A portion of Baker’s signature remained, but no indication of what the terms of the will had been. Poirot sat back on his heels. His expression would have been comical if we had not been so overcome. “I understand it not,” he growled. “Who destroyed this? And what was their object?” “The Bakers?” I suggested. “Pourquoi? Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit yes; but one cannot suspect institutions.” “Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,” I suggested. Poirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care. “That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.” By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal. “Vite, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!” Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention. “Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again will I vaunt my little grey cells!” “That’s a good job at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this all about?” As usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely no attention to me. “The tradesmen’s books I have left them entirely out of account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at once.” Easier said than done.",0
"“I don’t suppose she’ll stay after this,” said Pagett. “You always were a cheerful fellow,” I said. I expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends that I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify. Three days later. It is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England in winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this trouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to impossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline has been pacified with double pay. We could have sent her a cable to that effect from Cannes. In fact, as I have said all along, there was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall go back to-morrow. One day later. Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn. “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate very delicate.” “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.” He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. “My dear Pedler! The common post!” It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’ Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents. “If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.” “Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.” “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?” “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.” “You would be doing the Government a great service a very great service. You would not find them er ungrateful.” “Meaning, you want me to be the postman?” “Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is bona fide. Everything would be eminently satisfactory.” “Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.” “You will find the climate of South Africa delightful quite delightful.” “My dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there shortly before the war.” “I am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round the package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts’s own hands, you understand? The Kilmorden Castle sails on Saturday quite a good boat.” I accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He shook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively. I walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental policy. It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young men with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks. Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you need have no fear for yourself” I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face “you are not threatened. Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr. Milray wishes me to accompany you. The passage-money will be our affair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the passport, as though you had decided that you needed the services of a second secretary.” He seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he stared me down.",0
"“Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur Poirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair?” “Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man arrived?” “It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?” “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.” “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.” “What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station.",0
"""Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain.",0
"Always employ the expert that has been my motto. The one time I departed from it I came to grief but I couldn’t trust any one to do that job for me. Nadina knew too much. I’m an easy-going man, kind-hearted and good tempered so long as I’m not thwarted. Nadina both thwarted me and threatened me just as I was at the apex of a successful career. Once she was dead and the diamonds were in my possession, I was safe. I’ve come to the conclusion now that I bungled the job. That idiot Pagett, with his wife and family! My fault it tickled my sense of humour to employ the fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner’s face and his mid-Victorian soul.",0
"Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals each and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off. Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape, a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn’t like me. Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy. Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could.",0
"He was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand. I recognized the five-pointed star or Pentagon many times repeated. As was his wont, Poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general, White Magic as opposed to Black, with various references to the Ka and the Book of the Dead thrown in. It appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in Dr. Tosswill, who drew me aside, literally snorting with rage. “Balderdash, sir,” he exclaimed angrily. “Pure balderdash. The man’s an impostor. He doesn’t know the difference between the superstitions of the Middle Ages and the beliefs of Ancient Egypt. Never have I heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.” I calmed the excited expert, and joined Poirot in the tent. My little friend was beaming cheerfully. “We can now sleep in peace,” he declared happily. “And I can do with some sleep. My head, it aches abominably. Ah, for a good tisane!” As though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and Hassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to Poirot. It proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately fond. Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert. “A wonderful place,” I said aloud, “and a wonderful work. I can feel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel the charm?” I got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was quickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude couch, his face horribly convulsed. Beside him was the empty cup. I rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to Dr. Ames’s tent. “Dr. Ames!” I cried. “Come at once.” “What’s the matter?” said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas. “My friend. He’s ill. Dying. The camomile tea. Don’t let Hassan leave the camp.” Like a flash the doctor ran to our tent. Poirot was lying as I left him. “Extraordinary,” cried Ames. “Looks like a seizure or what did you say about something he drank?” He picked up the empty cup. “Only I did not drink it!” said a placid voice. We turned in amazement. Poirot was sitting up on the bed. He was smiling. “No,” he said gently. “I did not drink it. While my good friend Hastings was apostrophizing the night, I took the opportunity of pouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. That little bottle will go to the analytical chemist. No” as the doctor made a sudden movement “as a sensible man, you will understand that violence will be of no avail. During Hastings’ brief absence to fetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah, quick, Hastings, hold him!” I misunderstood Poirot’s anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung myself in front of him. But the doctor’s swift movement had another meaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds filled the air, and he swayed forward and fell. “Another victim,” said Poirot gravely, “but the last. Perhaps it is the best way. He has three deaths on his head.” “Dr. Ames?” I cried, stupefied. “But I thought you believed in some occult influence?” “You misunderstood me, Hastings. What I meant was that I believe in the terrific force of superstition. Once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down to the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race. I suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct. The idea came to him, I imagine, with the death of Sir John Willard. A fury of superstition arose at once. As far as I could see, nobody could derive any particular profit from Sir John’s death. Mr. Bleibner was a different case. He was a man of great wealth. The information I received from New York contained several suggestive points. To begin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion of his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him to Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet he was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must have lent him the money.” “All that was very thin,” I objected. “But there was more. Hastings, there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can happen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘I am a leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.” “What?” I ejaculated. “It was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the South Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough. Ames was a former friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never dream of doubting his word. When I arrived here, my suspicions were divided between Harper and Dr. Ames, but I soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and I learnt from Harper that he was previously acquainted with young Bleibner. Doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. The latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth. It was easy for him to inoculate Mr.",0
"A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. “Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.",0
"I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out.",0
"In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots in the other, none! You see? Some one had passed that way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.” “Where did they get a rake?” “Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot impatiently. “There is no difficulty about that.” “What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, mon ami.",0
"Not even a balcony outside.” “Even if there were,” said the inspector impatiently, “I don’t see how that would help us, if the maid never left the room.” “Évidemment,” said Poirot, not disconcerted. “As Mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room” He was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher. “Nothing,” said the latter laconically. “I should hope not, indeed,” said the chambermaid virtuously. “And that French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girl’s character!” “There, there, my girl; that’s all right,” said the inspector, opening the door. “Nobody suspects you. You go along and get on with your work.” The chambermaid went unwillingly. “Going to search her?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine. “Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key. Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her. The inspector’s face grew graver. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room.” Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully. “Si, si, mon enfant I assure you it is better not to resist.” Then he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little experiment purely for my own satisfaction.” “Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally. Poirot addressed Célestine once more. “You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it?” “On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.” “And the scissors?” “They also.” “Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?” Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned. Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand. “Again, if you please, mademoiselle.” At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket. “Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,” he bowed to the inspector “for your courtesy.” The inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness. Célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Then, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to work to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards, completely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked on sceptically. “You really think you will find them?” “Yes, sir. It stands to reason.",0
"""How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed.",0
"Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.” “Pardon,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?” “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound and you are a dead man, remember.’ “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.” “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?” “None whatever, monsieur.” “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?” “Yes. I had seen the change in him.” “How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed. “He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.” Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction. “Mon Dieu!” he ejaculated. “What is it?” “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!” “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished. But Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled. “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.” The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?” Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly. “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.” With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory. “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.” The magistrate nodded. “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.” “What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner.",0
"He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he digs and then ” “Yes?” “And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.… Now, Hastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of two crimes. The first crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to investigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged Hercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to solve that will be difficult since the criminal in his wisdom, has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by M.",0
"Hautet, delighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado, he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He also touched on the cheque made out to “Duveen,” and finally handed Giraud the letter signed “Bella.” Giraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then handed it back. “All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected.” “And your theory is?” “For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations.” “Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.” “Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.” Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: “I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.” We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I thought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as ever, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor. The detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion. “You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about the case. Let’s hear your views.” “One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M. Giraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there nothing it reminds you of?” “Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so, though.” “You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember but I shall do so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or less.” “There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate say a case of burglary can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely.",0
"And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences too! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders. This morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was urbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he alluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that I should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria. “You expect trouble, then?” I asked. His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far.",0

If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.” “And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue a psychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “Eh bien, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the salon door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?” The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.” “Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain Hastings.” Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. “Sent for you, did he?” “You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?” interposed M. Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about. He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities. Your name?” “Gabriel Stonor.” “How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?” “About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met him through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering good boss he was too.” “Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?” “Yes, a good bit.” “Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?” “Several times, I believe.” “He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him?” “Never.” “Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there?” “No.” “Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?” “Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there was a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.” “So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.” The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor the case is like this. There must be no reservations. You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might enfin!” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs. Renauld come in? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very wonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations, or otherwise, could affect her?” “Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that you’re wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have further proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the adjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never looked at a petticoat!” The secretary’s eyes narrowed. “Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul Renauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s some other explanation.” The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “What other explanation could there be?” “What leads you to think it was a love affair?” “Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! mon Dieu! What else could it be?” “Blackmail,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor. “The old man was being bled and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet. “Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it. What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M. Renauld?” “Over a year?” “Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?” “I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.” “In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?” “Absolutely.” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face. He was thoroughly taken aback. What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room. Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others.",0
"The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.” “Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly. “So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond.",0
"A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said.",0
"He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed. “He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.” Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction. “Mon Dieu!” he ejaculated. “What is it?” “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!” “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished. But Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled. “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.” The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?” Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly. “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.” With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory. “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly.",0
"I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face. I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board.",0
"He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale.",0
"No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her and your record’s against you. You’re a thief, remember, a thief. There’s one thing you don’t know, perhaps. I’ve got the diamonds. And here goes” With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite. “There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we’ll talk. I’ll drive a bargain with you. You’ve got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. There’s a chance for me if I can get away. I’m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man! There’s a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes’ start and I shall be all right. I’ve got one or two little arrangements all ready made. You let me out that way, and give me a start and I leave you a signed confession that I killed Nadina.” “Yes, Harry,” I cried. “Yes, yes, yes!” He turned a stern face on me. “No, Anne, a thousand times, no. You don’t know what you’re saying.” “I do. It solves everything.” “I’d never be able to look Race in the face again. I’ll take my chance, but I’m damned if I’ll let this slippery old fox get away. It’s no good, Anne. I won’t do it.” Sir Eustace chuckled. He accepted defeat without the least emotion. “Well, well,” he remarked. “You seem to have met your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.” There was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to enter the room. His face lit at the sight of us. “You’re safe, Anne. I was afraid” He turned to Sir Eustace. “I’ve been after you for a long time, Pedler and at last I’ve got you.” “Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,” declared Sir Eustace airily. “These young people have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things. I don’t know what it’s all about.” “Don’t you? It means that I’ve found the ‘Colonel.’ It means that on January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It means that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned to do away with her and at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you.” “Indeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information? From the man who is even now being looked for by the police? His evidence will be very valuable.” “We have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.” Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks alias the Rev. Edward Chichester alias Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: “I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me. He persuaded me to come over to his side.” Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. “Rats always leaving a sinking ship,” observed Sir Eustace. “I don’t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they’re in the big giraffe’s stomach. Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn’t rattle, and plugged it up again.” Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: “I always did hate that blinking giraffe,” he said. “It must have been instinct.” We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue. All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me little better than a limp rag. I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious of some barrier between us a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing. I came out on to the stoep early on the following morning and looked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer’s wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the stoep_, a book in my hand which I did not read. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It was not until he said “Good morning, Anne,” that I became aware of his presence. “Oh,” I said, with a flush, “it’s you.” “Yes. May I sit down?” He drew a chair up beside me. It was the first time we had been alone together since that day at the Matoppos. As always, I felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never failed to inspire in me. “What is the news?” I asked. “Smuts will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I give this outbreak three days more before it collapses utterly. In the meantime the fighting goes on.” “I wish,” I said, “that one could be sure that the right people were the ones to get killed. I mean the ones who wanted to fight not just all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the fighting is going on.” He nodded. “I know what you mean, Anne. That’s the unfairness of war. But I’ve other news for you.” “Yes?” “A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to escape.” “What?” “Yes. No one knows how he managed it. He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo’burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn’t seen him this morning. “You understand, don’t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.” He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. “I understand,” I said gratefully. “And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.” “No, of course not.” “You know his real name?” The question surprised me. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar. “Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?” “Of course I remember.” “I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.” “Was that what you meant?” “Of course.” I hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained. He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: “When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted me. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing. But youth’s call to youth. I’ve still got my work.” I was silent. I suppose one can’t really love two men at once but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I looked up at him suddenly. “I think that you’ll go very far,” I said dreamily. “I think that you’ve got a great career ahead of you. You’ll be one of the world’s big men.” I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. “I shall be alone, though.” “All the people who do really big things are.” “You think so?” “I’m sure of it.” He took my hand and said in a low voice: “I’d rather have had the other.” Then Harry came striding round the corner of the house. Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War. This is John Harold Eardsley.” With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry’s voice recalled me to myself. “Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.” He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away. “Why did you deceive me?” “I don’t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that sort of thing the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself for the man I was without ornaments and trappings.” “You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. “How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered. “But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.” “And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep. I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter.",0
"Giraud agrees with me, do you not, monsieur?” Whatever Giraud’s real belief, he accepted the position without moving a muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied: “Certainly I agree.” The murmur of surprise and interest broke out again. “But what an idea!” cried M. Hautet. “To stab a man after he is dead! Barbaric! Unheard of! Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.” “No, M. le juge,” said Poirot. “I should fancy it was done quite cold-bloodedly to create an impression.” “What impression?” “The impression it nearly did create,” returned Poirot oracularly. M. Bex had been thinking. “How, then, was the man killed?” “He was not killed. He died.",0
"“Say you’re sorry about my sister ” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have.",0
"She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world who know what they want, see that they get it, and manage to do so without being offensive. I decided that if I ever recovered but of course I shouldn’t it would amuse me to talk to her. We reached Madeira about midday. I was still too inert to move, but I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board and spread their merchandise about the decks. There were flowers too. I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better.",0
"Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter. I imitated her example most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out. We talked half the night. It had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted as well as aggressive ones. Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his party, I was fairly safe. Both he and Colonel Race were powerful protectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to stir up a hornet’s nest about my ears. Also, as long as I was near Sir Eustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious “Colonel.” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight. Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head the “Colonel” was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival. I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution. “There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace made his money!” “Suspecting him again?” “Suzanne, I’ve got into that state that I can’t help suspecting somebody! I don’t really suspect him but, after all, he is Pagett’s employer, and he did own the Mill House.” “I’ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn’t anxious to talk about,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean crime it might be tin-tacks or hair restorer!” I agreed ruefully. “I suppose,” said Suzanne doubtfully, “that we’re not barking up the wrong tree? Being led completely astray, I mean, by assuming Pagett’s complicity? Supposing that, after all, he is a perfectly honest man?” I considered that for a minute or two, then I shook my head. “I can’t believe that.” “After all, he has his explanations for everything.” “Y es, but they’re not very convincing. For instance, the night he tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden, he says he followed Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down. Now we know that’s not true.” “No,” said Suzanne unwillingly. “But we only heard the story at second-hand from Sir Eustace. If we’d heard it direct from Pagett himself, it might have been different. You know how people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.” I turned the thing over in my mind. “No,” I said at last, “I don’t see any way out. Pagett’s guilty. You can’t get away from the fact that he tried to throw me overboard, and everything else fits in. Why are you so persistent in this new idea of yours?” “Because of his face?” “His face? But” “Yes, I know what you’re going to say. It’s a sinister face. That’s just it. No man with a face like that could be really sinister. It must be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.” I did not believe much in Suzanne’s argument. I know a lot about Nature in past ages. If she’s got a sense of humour, she doesn’t show it much. Suzanne is just the sort of person who would clothe Nature with all her own attributes. We passed on to discuss our immediate plans. It was clear to me that I must have some kind of standing. I couldn’t go on avoiding explanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay ready to my hand, though I didn’t think of it for some time. The Daily Budget! My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn. He was marked down as “The Man in the Brown Suit” through no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be against him. The “Colonel” and his gang must have no suspicion that there existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I knew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to Lord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer “Nadina” who had been delighting Paris for so long. It seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified already but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw how natural it really was. Nadina had never been to England during her successful career in Paris.",0
"The wind was getting up, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp. “Ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried Poirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then turned the key in the lock. “I shall lock it, so!” “Don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now” And even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door slowly swung open.",0
"Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes.",0
"Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.",0
"""Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together?” “I don’t quite understand you?” “I will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?” The doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment. “You’re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you’ve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk?” “Absolute nonsense,” muttered Willard angrily. Poirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his green cat’s eyes. “So you do not believe it, monsieur le docteur?” “No, sir, I do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “I am a scientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.",0
"And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this I added to my report.",0
"“You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely.",0
I felt my temper stirred. “Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.” “Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his pocket. A lot of other people may have had too only they didn’t happen to be killed.” I rallied my forces. “You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?” “Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.” “And no money.,0
"Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.” She stopped. “Épatant!” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first water.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?” His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it. “I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to see.” What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance. “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?” Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast. “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I’m with you there, sir. I’ve already said so to Mary. But there! She’s a woman through and through, and I guess she can’t bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.” “What nonsense, Gregory!” said Mary Marvell sharply. But she flushed angrily. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Madame, I have advised. I can do no more. C’est fini.” He bowed them both to the door. “Ah! la la,” he observed, returning. “Histoire de femmes! The good husband, he hit the nail on the head tout de même, he was not tactful! Assuredly not.” I imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously. “So I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath all this. With your permission, mon ami, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown. “Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair.",0
"“I have made all arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned.",0
"A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him.",0
"I wanted to stay on at the Falls in case he might have kidnapped you somewhere close by, but didn’t know what to do about the diamonds. I was afraid to keep them in my possession” Suzanne looked round her uneasily, as though she feared the walls might have ears, and then whispered vehemently in my ear. “A distinctly good idea,” I approved. “At the time, that is. It’s a bit awkward now. What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?” “The big ones were sent down to Cape Town. I heard from Pagett before I left the Falls, and he enclosed the receipt for their storage.",0
"And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.” “Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can be done is being done but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted theory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path near the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately off the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early on the Monday morning. I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg. A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems pretty clear that she can’t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy in interfering in other people’s affairs. If I were this young fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came asking questions about my love affairs. Later. It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear, but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored. The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable.  Johannesburg,  March 6th. There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw.",0
"I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend. “Bien!” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves.",0
"But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement.",0
"“I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I.",0
"Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew.",0
"Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town. I can alter my appearance a little wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window. Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard.",0
"""Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?” The man looked up at him and started. “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours. The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.” “What about the jewel-case?” I asked. “It was found in a corridor of the hotel.",0
"There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls! This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness.",0
"If I ever said I did, I lied. No, but there’s one person on board who’s known all along. He’s only got to speak and my number’s up. All the same, I’m taking a sporting chance that he won’t speak.” “Why?” “Because he’s a man who likes playing a lone hand. And when the police have got me I should be of no further use to him. Free, I might be! Well, an hour will show.” He laughed rather mockingly, but I saw his face harden. If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps going out of my life. I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours. Not till I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the ridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe freely once more. No arrest had been made, and I realized that it was a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined Suzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the hotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson. It was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought of Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the sure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight. Suzanne was not nearly so enthusiastic. She has travelled a great deal of course. Besides, she is not the type that gets excited before breakfast. She snubbed me severely when I let out an enthusiastic yelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus. By the way, I should like to make it clear here and now that this story will not be a story of South Africa. I guarantee no genuine local colour you know the sort of thing half a dozen words in italics on every page. I admire it very much, but I can’t do it. In South Sea Islands, of course, you make an immediate reference to bêche-de-mer. I don’t know what bêche-de-mer is, I never have known, I probably never shall know. I’ve guessed once or twice and guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to talk about a stoep_ I do know what a stoep is it’s the thing round a house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you call it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw. I had always vaguely associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong that is a lava-lava. At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England.",0
"“I shut my eyes and think.” Japp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.” “And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?” “Certainly. That’s in the bargain.” “Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. “Like robbing a child!” I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room. “Eh bien!” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?” He shook his finger at me.",0
"It had character. It had charm. A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged me or Suzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to the position that I had been the first to behold its beauty. In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this three-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals, all of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat of a problem.",0
"Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.",0
"And you were right.” I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance. “My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.” “Ended?” “But yes. They are arrested.” “Who are arrested?” “The chambermaid and the valet, parbleu! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?” “You said cabinet-makers used it.” “Certainly they do to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot.",0
"“Soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of beef, and a rice soufflé. What time? Just about eight o’clock, I should say. No, I’m afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now. Unfortunate. You were thinking of finger-prints, I suppose?” “Not exactly,” said Poirot, with an enigmatical smile. “I am more interested in Count Foscatini’s appetite. Did he partake of every dish?” “Yes; but of course I can’t say how much of each he ate. The plates were all soiled, and the dishes empty that is to say, with the exception of the rice soufflé. There was a fair amount of that left.",0
"I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight. It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that’s extra beautiful. I’m not very good at expressing these things, but I knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment, the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsly.",0
"A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged me or Suzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to the position that I had been the first to behold its beauty. In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this three-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals, all of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat of a problem. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals each and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off. Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape, a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn’t like me. Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy. Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could. And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament. He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her. And at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she had a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone. He is a strange man. One doesn’t notice it so much in a crowd. But, when one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do. It was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft yellow brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent except our car which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing about engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be in its interior. By and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders appeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel Race.",0
"Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station.",0
"He had read of my arrival on the Kilmorden, in which I was described as the daughter of the late Professor Beddingfeld. He had known my father slightly and had had a great admiration for him. He went on to say that his wife would be delighted if I would come out and have tea with them that afternoon at their Villa at Muizenberg. He gave me instructions for getting there. It was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and highly thought of. I foresaw that I would have to be personally escorted round the Museum before I left Cape Town, but I risked that.",0
"It is this gentleman here.” He moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out of the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of surprise. It was the Prime Minister! “For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?” “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.” “What?” “I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face” “But by whom?” “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.” “Impossible!” “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.” “But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every one!” “He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.” “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?” “Rids himself of his disguise.",0
"We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it.",0
"The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name, and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye. “I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.",0
"The Flemmings took in the Daily Budget, and the Daily Budget was having a day after its own heart. EXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT. WOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station.",0
"There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here.",0
"Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if ” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they were. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.” We could say no more, for the old man had joined us. “You want me for something, monsieur?” “Yes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven’t you?” “Twenty-four years, monsieur.” “And your name is ?” “Auguste, monsieur.” “I was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb. They have been planted long?” “Some time, monsieur. But of course, to keep the beds looking smart, one must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that are over, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.” “You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired. Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize ” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully.",0
"“You know me?” Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures. How should I not know you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.” “You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!” said my friend grandiloquently. “It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.” “We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge. “The injury is serious, then?” I asked. “What injury?” “The bullet wound.” “Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.” “As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.” “There has been a second attempt, then?” “Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has disappeared.” “What?” “He has been kidnapped!” “Impossible!” I cried, stupefied. Poirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut. “Unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,” continued his lordship. Poirot looked at Mr. Dodge. “You said just now, monsieur, that time was everything. What did you mean by that?” The two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said: “You have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied Conference?” My friend nodded. “For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow Thursday evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.” Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?” “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.” “And the Conference is to be held?” “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.” Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket. “It is now a quarter to nine.” “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully. “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur it may come in useful. Now for the details the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?” “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.” “Eh bien?” “Well, they started from Boulogne but they never arrived.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.” “And the bogus car?” “Is still at large.” Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?” “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible but nothing has been discovered!” At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.” The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew. “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” “And they have found nothing else?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.” “If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.” “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same who accompanied him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?” Lord Estair smiled. “I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.” “Has he any relatives in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.” “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?” “That point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.” “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?” A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced anyone above suspicion.” “Très bien. Now I understand, milord, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?” Lord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.” “O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?” “Yes, he is an Irishman.” “From what part of Ireland?” “County Clare, I believe.” “Tiens! But proceed, milord.” “The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road” “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot. “Yes but how did you know?” “Oh, c’est évident! Continue!” “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur” “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully. “The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.” “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver. “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.” “That is all you have to tell me?” “Yes.” “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?” “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.” “Yes?” “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.” “And the chauffeur?” “The chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.” “So,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the Prime Minister in France, and O’Murphy in London.” He looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair. “I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.” “And to-day?” “To-day I do not know what to think.” Poirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again. “I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.” “Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard. You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?” “Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.” “We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country.” “Comment? My old friend the Préfet?” Lord Estair shook his head. “One higher than the Préfet. One whose word was once law in Belgium and shall be again! That England has sworn!” Poirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. “Amen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time. But this is dark dark. I cannot see.” “Well, Poirot,” I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the Ministers, “what do you think?” My friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft movements. He shook his head thoughtfully. “I do not know what to think. My brains desert me.” “Why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do as well?” I mused. “Pardon me, mon ami, but I did not quite say that. It is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.” “But why?” “Because uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the Prime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the situation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will the Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive? Nobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done. And, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what les Boches are playing for. Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal paymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run no risk of the hangman’s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their affair.” “Then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?” Poirot made a gesture of anger. “Ah, that is just what I do not understand! It is inexplicable stupid! They have all their arrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the abduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost impossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not twenty miles from London!” “Perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other,” I suggested. “Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor in the first affair, anyway. But who was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?” “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.” “Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each other. If O’Murphy is an honest man, why did he leave the main road? But if he was a dishonest man, why did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired thereby, in all probability, saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, again, if he was honest, why did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a well-known rendezvous of German spies?” “It looks bad,” I said. “Let us look at the case with method. What have we for and against these two men? Take O’Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels. There is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages for a good Englishman! (Pardon me, mon ami, but, as linguists, you are deplorable!) Now for him, we have the fact that he was found gagged, bound, and chloroformed which does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter.” “He might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.” Poirot shook his head. “The French police would make no mistake of that kind. Besides, once he had attained his object, and the Prime Minister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his remaining behind.",0
"""You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only part of the story that he wasn’t vague about. “There’s something very queer about all this,” he said. “To begin with, where is Rayburn?” It’s perfectly true that we haven’t seen the fellow since we came on shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however. Altogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter. I can’t take him about with me in his present condition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray’s billet-doux, but I shall not take Pagett with me. Confound the fellow and his prowling ways. Altogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast with poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of getting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired. Later. A very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray’s sealed letter. It didn’t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper! Now, I suppose, I’m in the devil of a mess. Why I ever let that bleating old fool Milray embroil me in the matter I can’t think. Pagett is a famous Job’s comforter. He displays a certain gloomy satisfaction that maddens me. Also, he has taken advantage of my perturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk. Unless he is careful, the next funeral he attends will be his own. However, in the end I had to listen to him. “Supposing, Sir Eustace, that Rayburn had overheard a word or two of your conversation with Mr. Milray in the street? Remember, you had no written authority from Mr. Milray. You accepted Rayburn on his own valuation.” “You think Rayburn is a crook, then?” I said slowly. Pagett did. How far his views were influenced by resentment over his black eye I don’t know. He made out a pretty fair case against Rayburn. And the appearance of the latter told against him. My idea was to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact. But Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was all for vigorous measures. He had his way of course. He bustled out to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a herd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies and sodas at my expense. We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned. You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. Later. Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot. You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” “I shall manage,” I said airily. “Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o’clock train to-morrow, Wednesday, morning,” Pagett continued. “I have made all arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned. “I must have been very drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed. Take my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you, don’t go on the bust again.” “As you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.” “Much wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I haven’t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I said thoughtfully. “She wants to get to Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I’ve a good mind to offer her a temporary job as a secretary. She can typewrite, I know, for she told me so.” To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not like Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he has displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries nowadays. Just to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has extremely nice legs.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I don’t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first sight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out on deck. I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight.",0
"He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain. He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles. After a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames.",0
"But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.” I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly. “A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye” He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed.",0
"She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room and found yourself in the hands of your enemies!” Harry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to Sir Eustace. “Yes,” murmured the latter, “decidedly you are not lucky! This is let me see, the third encounter.” “You are right,” said Harry. “This is the third encounter. Twice you have worsted me have you never heard that the third time the luck changes? This is my round cover him, Anne.” I was all ready.",0
"She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will.",0
"“I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.",0
"“It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.",0
"She not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an exclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella! The surprise was mutual. “You,” we both exclaimed simultaneously. The young lady recovered herself first. “My only Aunt!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” “For the matter of that, what are you?” I retorted. “When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home to England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket to and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?” I ignored the end of the speech.",0
"It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling.",0
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr.",0
"What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.",0
"It contained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.  (From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Johannesburg,  March 7th. Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at once that we should go off to Pretoria.",0
"“I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race.",0
"Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester.",0
"No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you.",0
"Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed.",0
"""I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed.",0
"Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P.",0
"It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot.",0
"“He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks him down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and find Pagett lying there. How’s that?” “You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.",0
"There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts. From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.” The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt? I wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s reply was prompt: “Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.” Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required. Taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on the fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention that inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot’s prognostication. No such woman as “Mrs. Middleton” had ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection. “Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.” “It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?” “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “Précisément and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.” “Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.” “And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.” “If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly. “And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.” “I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.” “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway” “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.” “Who is his uncle?” “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.” “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?” “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.” “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty. Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm. “You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile. “I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question.",0
"Our people are going through France with a toothcomb. So are the French. I can’t help feeling it’s only a matter of hours now.” “That is, if he’s still alive,” remarked the tall detective gloomily. Japp’s face fell. “Yes. But somehow I’ve got the feeling he’s alive all right.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, yes; he’s alive. But can he be found in time? I, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.” The whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then, with a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station. It was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together. Maps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages.",0
"I was in the hands of the enemy. It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.” How often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It’s all very well on the screen you have the comfortable knowledge that there’s bound to be an Episode IV. But in real life there was absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said that morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it going to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale. In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell. My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned. “Here you are and here you stay,” he remarked facetiously. I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. “I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum. If I have made a mistake” “A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!” He laughed coarsely. “What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police” “Yap, yap, yap like a little toy dog.” He laughed. I sat down on a chair. “I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,” I said coldly. “Indeed?” “I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?” “So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?” Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances. Should I mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. “Mrs. Blair, for one,” I said lightly. “A friend of mine with whom I am staying.” “I think not,” said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. “You have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.” His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed, but I was not going to give in without a fight. “You are very clever,” I said. “Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was going this afternoon.” To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so! “Enough of this,” he said harshly, rising. “What are you going to do with me?” I asked, still endeavouring to appear composed. “Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you.” For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me. “To-morrow you’ll have some questions to answer, and after you’ve answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we’ve more ways than one of making obstinate little fools talk.” It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until to-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied. The Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind him. I was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen my hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from crying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the house, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below I heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was going out. It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again at my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still roll. Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy. Besides being extremely painful, since I could not guard my face with my arms, it was also exceedingly difficult to keep any particular direction. I tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go. In the end, however, I came right up against my objective. It almost touched my bound hands. Even then it was not easy.",0
"On the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car had been sent to meet us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit. “Since it is carte blanche, we will hire a car,” he said cheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of Merlinville.",0
"Schneider to-day.’ And a bit more of the same. Young Bleibner lit out for Cairo right away.” “Was he in perfectly good health at the time?” “The old man?” “No, the young one.” “I believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But it couldn’t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.” “One thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?” “So far as we know, he has not.” “Are you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?” “No, sir, I am not. I’m for New York as soon as I can square up things here.",0
"And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark Anzora sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.",0
"“Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “Mon ami,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “Mon Dieu! no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! Eh bien, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.” “There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! Eh bien! it comes to this are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well I warned you. When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed.",0
"It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M.",0
"No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and above-board but who is this?” A tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. He passed us without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking, with a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime. A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him. “Tell me, I pray you, who is that gentleman? Do you know him?” “I don’t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it. He was staying down here last week for a night. Tuesday, it was.” “Quick, mon ami, let us follow him.” We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face blanched noticeably. “You,” she gasped. “I thought you were on the sea on your way to East Africa?” “I got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the young man. “My old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money. Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel my passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do. You’ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps.” At that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped forward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction. “Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black.” A few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited the fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn. The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew. We returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee line for the Anchor Inn. “Here we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,” he explained. “You notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I meant it. But no you observed Mrs. Maltravers’ face when she caught sight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he eh bien, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here on Tuesday night the day before Mr. Maltravers died. We must investigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.” In about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn. Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged. “I have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us here,” he explained. “You can understand, monsieur le capitaine, that I am anxious to arrive at Mr.",0
"“I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not.",0
"The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county.",0
"This morning I received this telegram.” He handed it over to me: “Come at once uncle Harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do come Zoe.” “Then, as yet you know no details?” “No, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the police are in charge.” It was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station of Elmer’s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors. “A lonely place,” I observed with a shiver. Havering nodded. “I shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.",0
"Oh, save him, save him save him!” We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us. The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient greffier sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I I told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.” “Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?” “No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we heard of the murder.” Another railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s evidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld. “These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Nothing.” M. Hautet exchanged a glance with the greffier, as the scratching of the latter’s pen recorded the answer. “Renauld,” continued the magistrate, “do you recognize this?” He took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the prisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger. “Pardon,” cried Maître Grosíer. “I demand to speak to my client before he answers that question.” But Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched Grosíer. He waved him aside, and replied quietly: “Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as a souvenir of the War.” “Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in existence?” Again Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him. “Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.” Even the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection: “Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will doubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that Madame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had taken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me ” I saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice: “I shall not contradict you. It is possible.” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back. “M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried. “Yes, but I forbid ” “My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of Mr. Renauld.” “My Friend: “You will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out with struggling. “You will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever, to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn’t for myself I did it that’s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself. “I’ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her. I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife wicked little thing! that Jack had given Bella! Ten to one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress. “I told you that I was staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but of course really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again. “Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God’s earth. I told her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing… laughing… laughing… it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once. “And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night… I was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her. So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.” “But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me. “What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the hand. Young Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated before starting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor accompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan looks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “Eh ma foi! and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle.",0
"The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible but nothing has been discovered!” At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.” The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew. “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C.",0
"Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s arm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was weeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs. Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe. “Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent omelette, and an equally excellent entrecôte to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length café noir had completed the meal. “Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little salon.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say ” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us. I took her hands in both of mine. My eyes said the rest. Poirot cleared his throat. “Mes enfants,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “Très bien, mon enfant,” said Poirot. “I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle ” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot. “I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping that is the great thing. Maman made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest.",0
"“Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in getting the case dismissed but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer.

"“This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman.",0
"Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah.",0
"We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment maman called me from the house, and I had to go. That is all, only I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie.",0
"There was only one diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, celui-là! “But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled. “For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.” “Lady Yardly?” “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance.",0
"""Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.",0
"I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved.",0
"“But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!” It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids. The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot.",0

He came out furious from the interview his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me. I had been madly in love with her for the moment I even think that I frightened her sometimes but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead. All I felt was, ‘What’s the good?’ My pal was dead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I was supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful existence here, neither happy nor unhappy numbed of all feeling. I see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was partly the effect of the war. “And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I was taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river, and I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation. It focused my attention on him. He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him. She had got in with a bad lot, he told me and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story. It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter. I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle, which left Cape Town in two days’ time. I had just time to journey down and catch the same boat. “I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board. I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge, and it was comparatively easy for me to transform myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age.",0
"“Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.",0
"“But it’s been happy, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been hell!” “As bad as that!” “What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you say that laughing into your hair?” “I wasn’t laughing. And I’m not mocking. If you want me to go, I’ll go. But if you want me to stay I’ll stay.” “Not that!” he cried vehemently. “Not that. Don’t tempt me, Anne. Do you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down. They know me here as Harry Parker they think I’ve been away on a trek up country, but any day they may put two and two together and then the blow will fall.",0
"But who was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?” “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.” “Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each other.",0
"“Mother!” “Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what brings you here? You were to sail on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others, she turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet, acknowledging the young man’s bow. “So you did not sail on the Anzora?” “No, monsieur. As I was about to explain, the Anzora was detained twenty-four hours through engine trouble. I should have sailed last night instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening paper, I saw in it an account of the the awful tragedy that had befallen us ” His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. “My poor father my poor, poor, father.” Staring at him like one in a dream, Mrs. Renauld repeated: “So you did not sail?” And then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured as though to herself, “After all, it does not matter now.” “Sit down, M. Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah. And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark Anzora sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.” “You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines. In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent, that he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that he had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded the mission to South America as connected with business interests. As M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in. “I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.” “By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly. Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table. “Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?” “Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily. “You assert that positively?” “Yes.” “No little disputes, eh?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of opinion now and then.” “Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for Paris, that person, without doubt, would be lying?” I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know everything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question. “We we did have an argument,” he admitted. “Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this phrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’” “I may have done,” muttered the other. “I don’t know.” “In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am not dead yet!’ To which you responded: ‘I wish you were!’” The boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him. “I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply. With an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor. “What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with my father. I dare say I said all those things I was so angry I cannot even remember what I said! I was furious I could almost have killed him at that moment there, make the most of that!” He leant back in his chair, flushed and defiant. Giraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said: “That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the interrogatory, M. le juge.” “Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your quarrel?” “I decline to state.” M. Hautet sat up in his chair. “M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered. “What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But another voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I will inform you, if you like, M. le juge.” “You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this attachment, madame.” “I feared it,” she replied simply. “Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is beautiful. What can you have against her?” “I have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should prefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who has a mother of doubtful antecedents!” Her rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I could well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when her only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her rival. Mrs. Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate: “I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I hoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death ” Poirot interrupted with a quick question. “You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?” “I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad. “Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate. “After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly realized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last. Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective. Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so. “Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does ” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother. The magistrate understood. “As yet no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?” “I have no idea whatsoever.” M. Hautet sighed. “A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis. “And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from you to your mother. Very sad very distressing ” Jack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the the body?” “Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure? It would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it. Still M. Bex, might I trouble you?” “Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.” “Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested Giraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s body.” The boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate, always disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible, replied. “But no not at present. M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here.” The commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack, and wrung him by the hand. Poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was reading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging desperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back. Suddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in. “M. le juge! M. le juge!” “But yes. What is it?” “The dagger! It is gone!” “Comment gone?” “Vanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!” “What?” I cried. “Impossible. Why, only this morning I saw ” The words died on my tongue. But the attention of the entire room was diverted to me. “What is that you say?” cried the commissary. “This morning?” “I saw it there this morning,” I said slowly. “About an hour and a half ago, to be accurate.” “You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?” “I asked the sergent de ville for it.” “And you went there? Why?” I hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it. “M. le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “Eh bien! Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.” “Ah, par exemple,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.” “I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.” “Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening.",0
"In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg.",0
"Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack. “He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, jeune homme?” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said. I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud. “What are your grounds for arresting him?” “Do you expect me to give them to you?” “As a matter of courtesy, yes.” Giraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary. “You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered. “It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice. Giraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red. “Eh bien, come in here. You shall judge for yourself.” He flung open the door of the salon, and we passed in, leaving Jack Renauld in the care of the two other men. “Now, M. Poirot,” said Giraud laying his hat on the table, and speaking with the utmost sarcasm, “I will treat you to a little lecture on detective work. I will show you how we moderns work.” “Bien!” said Poirot, composing himself to listen. “I will show you how admirably the Old Guard can listen,” and he leaned back and closed his eyes, opening them for a moment to remark. “Do not fear that I shall sleep. I will attend most carefully.” “Of course,” began Giraud, “I soon saw through all that Chilian tomfoolery. Two men were in it but they were not mysterious foreigners! All that was a blind.” “Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “Especially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.” Giraud glared, but continued: “A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the grave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there was a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld’s quarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The motive was established. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night. He concealed the fact which turned suspicion into certainty. Then we found a second victim stabbed with the same dagger. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here can fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only person who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other members of the household.” Poirot interrupted: “You are wrong.",0
"“Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?” “You consider him a rich man, doctor?” The doctor looked rather surprised. “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.” “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly. The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly. “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe.",0
"The curtains and portière were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward, passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, mon ami! And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief.",0
"We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.” By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal. “Vite, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!” Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.",0
"Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest.",0
"I was on the staff of the Daily Budget, and I had a private word of congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that it was he best so for the present. We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail.",0
"It was after midnight. I leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam. Ahead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark water. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange peace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream. And suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger. I had heard nothing, but I swung round instinctively. A shadowy form had crept up behind me. As I turned, it sprang. One hand gripped my throat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately, but I had no chance.",0
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her. For my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject as we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest. “But yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not underrate the force of superstition.” “What are we going to do about it?” “Toujours pratique, the good Hastings! Eh bien, to begin with we are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr. Bleibner’s death.” He duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young Rupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead.",0
"Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn’t rattle, and plugged it up again.” Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: “I always did hate that blinking giraffe,” he said. “It must have been instinct.” We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue.",0
"She can simulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating type as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him, but separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to separate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack the heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and at a stroke she will attain wealth not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing. It is all so easy.",0
"In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me.",0
"""Comment?” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things.",0
"“But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.” “And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep. I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I sprang up. Harry was on the stoep outside. “Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.” I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing. “Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing the things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?” “Yes,” I said, wondering what was coming.",0
"“Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once I offer it again. Will you have it?” The fierceness of his answer took me aback. “No. I’ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise.",0
"“It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows.",0
"I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on. It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling. Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew. The murder in the house at Marlow was not an isolated incident committed by a solitary individual. I was up against a gang, and, thanks to Colonel Race’s revelations to Suzanne, and what I had overheard at the house at Muizenberg, I was beginning to understand some of its manifold activities. Systematized crime, organized by the man known to his followers as the “Colonel”! I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the strike on the Rand and the causes underlying it and the belief that some secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation. That was the “Colonel’s” work, his emissaries were acting according to plan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard, as he limited himself to directing and organizing.",0
"As to your question, I’m sure I don’t know.” “You could find out?” asked Poirot with curious persistence. “Oh, certainly if you really want to know.” “Merci, mon ami. I should be obliged if you would make a point of it.” Japp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have forgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and murmuring, “Poor old fellow! War’s been too much for him!” gently withdrew from the room. As Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper, and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend’s voice aroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk and alert.",0
"Ah!” A cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear tones came the words: “No, you don’t! I’ve got you and my wrists are just like steel.” At the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by Françoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door. “It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.” There was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale, beckoned us in. “She is safe?” demanded Poirot. “Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.” Mrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping for breath. “Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong. “A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at the door. Where is the other?” The girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil! ve confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you must have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room her boudoir,” he explained. “But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you why was I not told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child ” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour slightly to my annoyance. I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police.",0
"""Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted. “I shouldn’t dream of marrying any one unless I was madly in love with them. And of course there is really nothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn’t like for the sake of some one she does like. And the more self-willed she is, the more she likes it.” “I’m afraid I disagree with you. The boot is on the other leg as a rule.” He spoke with a slight sneer. “Exactly,” I cried eagerly. “And that’s why there are so many unhappy marriages. It’s all the fault of the men. Either they give way to their women and then the women despise them, or else they are utterly selfish, insist on their own way and never say ‘thank you.’ Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want, and then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it. Women like to be mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated. On the other hand, men don’t really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most of the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects it, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be!” Harry laughed outright. “What a cat and dog life you will lead.” “Lovers always fight,” I assured him. “Because they don’t understand each other. And by the time they do understand each other they aren’t in love any more.” “Does the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always lovers?” “I I don’t know,” I said, momentarily confused. He turned away to the fireplace. “Like some more soup?” he asked in a casual tone. “Yes, please. I’m so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.” “That’s good.” He busied himself with the fire; I watched. “When I can get off the couch, I’ll cook for you,” I promised. “I don’t suppose you know anything about cooking.” “I can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,” I retorted, pointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece. “Touché,” he said, and laughed. His whole face changed when he laughed. It became boyish, happy a different personality. I enjoyed my soup. As I ate it I reminded him that he had not, after all, tendered me his advice. “Ah, yes, what I was going to say was this. If I were you I would stay quietly perdu here until you are quite strong again. Your enemies will believe you dead. They will hardly be surprised at not finding the body. It would have been dashed to pieces on the rocks and carried down with the torrent.” I shivered. “Once you are completely restored to health, you can journey quietly on to Beira and get a boat to take you back to England.” “That would be very tame,” I objected scornfully. “There speaks a foolish schoolgirl.” “I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.",0
"“You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile.",0
"s.” “Eh bien?” “Well, they started from Boulogne but they never arrived.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.” “And the bogus car?” “Is still at large.” Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?” “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed.",0
"But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured. “Quick. Water.…” I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. “Take me out of here oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. “That’s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?” I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile. Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse.",0
"Poirot: “If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn to, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees to help us. “MARTHE DAUBREUIL.” I handed it back, moved. “You will go?” “At once. We will command an auto.” Half an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the door to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of his. “Ah, you have come it is good of you. I have been in despair, not knowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even. I suffer horribly, I am nearly mad.",0
"Pagett had brought a sixth child into the world the other day. England will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the child a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness to act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post card straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face! Bless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you have made in not marrying me. Yours ever, Eustace Pedler. Harry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not see eye to eye. To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder me and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend. Sir Eustace’s attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are not in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had a genuinely kindly feeling towards me. Then why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says “because he’s a damned scoundrel,” and seems to think that settles the matter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her, and she put it down to a “fear complex.” Suzanne goes in rather for psycho-analysis. She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace’s whole life was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had an acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina removed certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the state of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute fears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina, she was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of questionable things in order to get rich, but women shouldn’t pretend to be in love when they aren’t for ulterior motives. I can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive Nadina. Never, never, never! The other day I was unpacking some tins that were wrapped in bits of an old Daily Budget, and I suddenly came upon the words, “The Man in the Brown Suit.” How long ago it seemed! I had, of course, severed my connection with the Daily Budget long ago I had done with it sooner than it had done with me. My Romantic Wedding was given a halo of publicity. My son is lying in the sun, kicking his legs. There’s a “man in a brown suit” if you like. He’s wearing as little as possible, which is the best costume for Africa, and is as brown as a berry. He’s always burrowing in the earth. I think he takes after Papa. He’ll have that same mania for Pleiocene clay. Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.” Strangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion. Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess! It was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective, Hercule Poirot. The Calais express was singularly empty in fact, my own compartment held only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace. “Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an imaginary audience. “I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but Oh, Lord, there’s reason enough for it! Do you know I’ve lost my only sister?” “Really?” I said politely. “How unfortunate.” “He disapproves!” remarked the lady. “He disapproves utterly of me, and my sister which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!” I opened my mouth, but she forestalled me. “Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo! I am crushed!” She buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter. “I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried. Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I most disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was decidedly pretty.… “There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx. “Say you’re sorry about my sister ” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.",0
"There were flowers too. I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly. When it came I enjoyed it. My attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a tall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day. I put him down at once as one of the strong, silent men of Rhodesia. He was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple, and was easily the best-looking man on board. When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my attractive woman was. “That’s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair. You must have read about her in the papers.” I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the polite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him. The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a halt by my chair. “Feeling better this morning?” I thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being. “You did look ill yesterday. Colonel Race and I decided that we should have the excitement of a funeral at sea but you’ve disappointed us.” I laughed. “Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered. “I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.” “About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are but I’ve got another roll.” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly. “Yes, I do feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled. I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was. “That man? Oh, that’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary. Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before. Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him, and the sea’s been too much for both of them. The other fellow hasn’t turned up yet. This man’s name is Pagett.” So Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board. Probably only a coincidence, and yet “That’s Sir Eustace,” my informant continued, “sitting next to the Captain. Pompous old ass.” The more I studied the secretary’s face, the less I liked it. Its even pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously flattened head it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension. Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind him as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied. “My cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir larger.” “I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed. He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong. When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock something would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time. If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully.",0
"” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well. I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did not know how intensely respectable he is I should suspect him of some disreputable amou. I wonder now! Even the most respectable menIt would cheer me up enormously if it was so. Pagett with a guilty secret! Splendid! It has been a curious evening. The only costume that fitted me in the barber’s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear. I don’t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter’s evening in England but it’s hardly an ideal costume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business from both sides. Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair, who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably. Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me. A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but at last they managed it, and a start was made. The mules raced along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.” This, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come from my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious. “My God!” he said anxiously.",0
"""He’s lying,” I thought. “But why?” “Has your master let the house? have there been any strangers in it during the last three years?” “No, sir.” “No visitors?” “Only Miss Violet.” “No strangers of any kind been inside this room?” “No, sir.” “You forget the workmen, Jim,” his wife reminded him. “Workmen?” Poirot wheeled round on her. “What workmen?” The woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague as to what the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her master’s and quite unnecessary.",0
"No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",0
"Well, what is it?” “When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece of paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead man. The doctor didn’t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some figures.” “Let’s see it.” Lord Nasby stretched out a careless hand. “I think not,” I said, smiling. “It’s my find, you see.” “I’m right. You are a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it. No scruples about not handing it over to the police?” “I went there to do so this morning.",0
"I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity ” “Well, then ” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice ” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life.",0
"Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel. Then another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more I thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I went up to the Villa Geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. I did not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by the shed, and sat there moodily enough. I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand. In a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they were approaching rapidly. A girl’s voice was speaking, a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe. “Chéri,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.” “Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack I am afraid.” I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man’s arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: “But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear now?” And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. “I am afraid for you.…” I did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There appeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least of it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me with a finger to its lips. It was Giraud. Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. “What were you doing there?” I asked. “Exactly what you were doing listening.” “But I was not there on purpose!” “Ah!” said Giraud. “I was.” As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. “You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?” “M.",0
"” What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance. “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?” Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast. “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I’m with you there, sir.",0
"Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly. “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us.",0
"""And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter.",0
"""Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did.",0
"Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got lots of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement. “Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!_” Diamonds! I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. “Are you sure, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear. I’ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts. They’re beauties too, Anne and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me. Was it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for my benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately “pumped.” For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in? What possible connection could he have with the affair? “Who is Colonel Race?” I asked. “That’s rather a question,” said Suzanne. “He’s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this trip. He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be rolling. You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence my husband, you know. It’s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.” “It must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like you.” “Well, I’m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and goes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married even to Clarence!” I disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all. Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.” “But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow. She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow. What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It looks as though he had some hold over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested in spite of myself. “You don’t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he’s a most capable and hard-working young man. And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.” “What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know but a scar can be faked easily enough.",0
"Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island.",0
"He binds and gags Madame Renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two years ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall upon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same story as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the mind against originality. The night is chilly, and he slips on an overcoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave with the dead man. He goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower bed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence against himself.",0
"My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know.",0
"It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her.",0
"Some gossip what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California why! it came to me in a flash of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf. “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing. “We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.” “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.” Miss Marvell nodded. “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.” “But I demand pardon if I am dense, madame surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?” A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older. “I want to wear it down there.” “Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?” “That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly. I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, c’est comme ça!” Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?” “Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do either of you ever see Society Gossip?” We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly. “I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it’s really very curious” She broke off. I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud: “. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more.",0
"” Then she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter.",0
"I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same one feels the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. “Better lift you,” he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture. I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of me, staring into my face. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he said abruptly. “I’m a gipsy seeing the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext. You’ve not the soul of the journalist. You’re out for your own hand snatching at life. But that’s not all.” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I said slowly, “that you are really connected with the Government that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden again. No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of them all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I offered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously. I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it. “Oh,” I cried indignantly, “they’re starved! It’s wicked. Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t don’t,” I said fiercely. “I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.",0
"What had happened to his usually keen wits? “They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.” “Tiens!” cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration. “But your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.” I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.",0
"Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the polite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him. The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a halt by my chair. “Feeling better this morning?” I thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being. “You did look ill yesterday. Colonel Race and I decided that we should have the excitement of a funeral at sea but you’ve disappointed us.” I laughed.",0
"But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there.",0
"I was in a small room with rough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer. The tears were running down my face. I was weak still, but I held his hand in both of mine. If only I could die like this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new look in his eyes. “Don’t cry, Anne. Please don’t cry. You’re safe now. No one shall hurt you.” He went and fetched a cup and brought it to me. “Drink some of this milk.” I drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used to a child. “Don’t ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You’ll be stronger by and by. I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several questions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English. Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.” “That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.",0
"According to him, you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to my interests. His story was extraordinarily vague and rambling, and it was a long time before I could make head or tail of it. To begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving suspiciously. Those are Pagett’s words. He has taken them straight from the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn’t know himself. I said so to him. “He was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the middle of the night, Sir Eustace.",0
"Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have. How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death. I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions. All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly. Pagett is staying behind here you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia which is very annoying, because I want to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted. “I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool.",0
"… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad.",0
"At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find! I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking.",0
"“What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M.",0
"Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.",0
"” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M.",0
"“My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up.",0
"Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.” She shook her head vigorously. “What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile. “A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too. Italian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.” “I shan’t. I like you did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.",0
"He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it. He was benignant, kind and fatherly and without the least doubt he regarded me as a perfect fool of a girl left adrift to face an unkind world. From the first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary. As things turned out, perhaps it was just as well I didn’t.",0
"Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one.",0
"The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing.",0
"What do you mean by ‘disappear’? To which class of disappearance are you referring?” “Are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” I laughed. Japp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both. “But certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First, and most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much abused ‘loss of memory’ case rare, but occasionally genuine. Third, murder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you refer to all three as impossible of execution?” “Very nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory, but some one would be sure to recognize you especially in the case of a well-known man like Davenheim.",0
"” He looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair. “I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.” “And to-day?” “To-day I do not know what to think.” Poirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again. “I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.” “Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard.",0
"“To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.” I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp. “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.” Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply: “Be exact, my friend.",0
"He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me.",0
"I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue.",0
"Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused. “Go on what next?” “I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links ” Again I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused. “You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely. “And you love me? Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which way to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!” Again I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could. “Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it and the wonder, I shall not forget no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “Mon ami,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “Mon Dieu! no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! Eh bien, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.” “There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! Eh bien! it comes to this are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well I warned you. When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.",0
"Only” “Yes?” “Eh bien, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to make up as himself again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right.",0
"A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes. “What is it?” I whispered. He shook his head impatiently, and asked a question: “Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself?” The commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied promptly: “No, Monsieur did not drive himself.” Poirot’s frown deepened. “I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently. “See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.” “Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested. “Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your own.",0
"And by the time they do understand each other they aren’t in love any more.” “Does the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always lovers?” “I I don’t know,” I said, momentarily confused. He turned away to the fireplace. “Like some more soup?” he asked in a casual tone. “Yes, please. I’m so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.” “That’s good.” He busied himself with the fire; I watched. “When I can get off the couch, I’ll cook for you,” I promised. “I don’t suppose you know anything about cooking.” “I can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,” I retorted, pointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece. “Touché,” he said, and laughed.",0
"“And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er the Madonna er Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So picturesque on the banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered.",0
"I saw the face for the first time the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face. “Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any chance?” As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.",0
"“Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively. We pulled up in front of the station. Here surely he would leave us. I turned with outstretched hand but no. “I’ll come and see you off. It’s just eight o’clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.” He gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train.",0
"""Why?” “To find a possible witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love.",0
"And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not last night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.” “English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride.",0
"When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa. I have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at last the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins me to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by his master’s side.",0
"Have you ever seen him before?” Drawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face, Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity. Then she shook her head. “I do not know him.” It seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head. “You are letting her go?” I asked in a low voice. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her head.” “I do not need teaching my business,” said Giraud dryly. “She is under surveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.",0
"I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.” “Beira,” I said meditatively. “Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to me.” We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at each other. “Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut. I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours.",0
"His name was Ned perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me. It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough. Any message that comes genuinely from me will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.” “Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?” “Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’” “Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head in and withdrawing it immediately. I stood up. “And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked demurely. Harry came close to me. “My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring his neck. And as for you” “Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited. “I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!” “What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically. “And doesn’t he change his mind overnight!” (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) As I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn for a quiet life and that’s just the one thing I don’t seem able to have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief of getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of intrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful creature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or two of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl. What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there. I had a dream a terrible dream that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn’t there and her bed hadn’t been slept in.” She looked at me appealingly. “What shall I do, Sir Eustace?” Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially. “What does Race say about it?” Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society. “I can’t find him anywhere.” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant.",0
"He contented himself with expressing surprise that I, too, was not equally au fait with the situation. I disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference. Once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of Poirot’s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd. “An elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. A great invalid, hardly moved out of his cabin.” The description appeared to tally with one Mr.",0
"They’re only acquaintances really even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must have known a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.” I managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all. “If you would be guided by me” he said, hesitating. “I don’t expect I shall be,” I answered candidly. “But there’s no harm in hearing.” “Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted.",0
"” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order. “Of course, if it’s already taken” “Oh, I’m sure I beg your pardon, miss. I’ve been fairly pestered with these newspaper people. Not a minute’s peace. No, the house isn’t let nor likely to be now.” “Are the drains wrong?” I asked in an anxious whisper. “Oh, Lord, miss, the drains is all right! But surely you’ve heard about that foreign lady as was done to death here?” “I believe I did read something about it in the papers,” I said carelessly. My indifference piqued the good woman. If I had betrayed any interest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster. As it was, she positively bridled. “I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The Daily Budget’s out still to catch the man who did it. It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope they’ll get him although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him ah, well, I dare say he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad they’re a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman. Stood there where you’re standing now.” “Was she dark or fair?” I ventured. “You can’t tell from these newspaper portraits.” “Dark hair, and a very white face too white for nature, I thought, and her lips reddened something cruel. I don’t like to see it a little powder now and then is quite another thing.” We were conversing like old friends now. I put another question. “Did she seem nervous or upset at all?” “Not a bit. She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she was amused at something. That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.” “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?” “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on, and, as my John says, money is money nowadays.” I concurred heartily with John’s by no means original remarks. “The young man now,” said Mrs. James, reverting suddenly to a former point in the conversation. “He was upset. His eyes, light eyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining. Excited, I thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong. Not even when he came out again looking all queer.” “How long was he in the house?” “Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.” “How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?” “I should say so maybe.” “He was clean-shaven, you say?” “Yes, miss not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.” “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it was. However did you know?” “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.” “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?” “Just the ordinary kind, miss. I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?” I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence my question to Mrs. James. Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low old-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key, I passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn and mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had come here “smiling to herself” a few days ago feel no chill of premonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil.",0
"In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M. Renauld?” “Over a year?” “Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?” “I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.” “In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?” “Absolutely.",0
"""Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish.",0
"Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.” She stopped.",0
"You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?” “Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.” “We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country.” “Comment? My old friend the Préfet?” Lord Estair shook his head. “One higher than the Préfet. One whose word was once law in Belgium and shall be again! That England has sworn!” Poirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute.",0
"“If you mean that it’s haunted,” I said, “we’re not going to sleep there, so I don’t see that it matters. Ghosts don’t affect typewriters.” Pagett said that it wasn’t a ghost, and that, after all, he hadn’t got Cabin 17. He told me a long, garbled story. Apparently he, and a Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come to blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and Pagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter. “Both 13 and 28 are better cabins,” he reiterated. “But they wouldn’t look at them.",0
"After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing. But youth’s call to youth. I’ve still got my work.” I was silent. I suppose one can’t really love two men at once but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I looked up at him suddenly. “I think that you’ll go very far,” I said dreamily. “I think that you’ve got a great career ahead of you. You’ll be one of the world’s big men.” I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. “I shall be alone, though.” “All the people who do really big things are.” “You think so?” “I’m sure of it.” He took my hand and said in a low voice: “I’d rather have had the other.” Then Harry came striding round the corner of the house. Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War. This is John Harold Eardsley.” With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry’s voice recalled me to myself. “Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.” He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away. “Why did you deceive me?” “I don’t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that sort of thing the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself for the man I was without ornaments and trappings.” “You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. “How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered.",0
"“We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “My dearest one:” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid.",0
"It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts. From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.",0
"He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table.",0
"I don’t like the prospect of being hungry, but I’m not alarmed for my personal safety. Smuts is perfectly capable of dealing with the revolution. But I would give a considerable sum of money for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of whisky with him when he arrives to-morrow? I put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs. The curio-shops in Jo’burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying a window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the shop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race. I can’t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on his accompanying me back to the hotel. I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily. “Where the devil did she go to that night, that’s what I’d like to know.” “She was on the island all the time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man on it?” “Yes.” “How very improper,” I said. “Pagett will be quite shocked. He always did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld. I suppose that was the young man she originally intended to meet in Durban?” “I don’t think so.” “Don’t tell me anything you don’t want to,” I said, by way of encouraging him. “I fancy that this is a young man we should all be very glad to lay our hands on.” “Not?” I cried, in rising excitement. He nodded. “Harry Rayburn, alias Harry Lucas that’s his real name, you know. He’s given us all the slip once more, but we’re bound to rope him in soon.” “Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying. Without stopping to reflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading statements, I gave myself up to the pleasure of scoring off Race. He is always so cocksure. I took the telegram from my pocket and handed it to him. “Then how do you explain this?” I asked nonchalantly. He seemed dumbfounded. “She said she was just starting for Beira,” he said, in a dazed voice. I know that Race is supposed to be clever. He is, in my opinion, rather a stupid man. It never seemed to occur to him that girls do not always tell the truth. “Kimberley too. What are they doing there?” he muttered. “Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the Daily Budget.” “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. “I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully. “Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers for which I shall be hauled over the coals and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town. It’s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as he was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.” I paused for breath. “You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I spoke.” “What? Pagett?” I cried, in lively astonishment. “He’s been with me eight years a most trustworthy fellow.” My interlocutor smiled. “We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.” “Miss Pettigrew?” I exclaimed. “Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop.” “God bless my soul!” I interrupted. “I was going into that place myself this afternoon. You might have caught me coming out!” There doesn’t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in Jo’burg without being suspected for it. “Ah! but she has been there more than once and in rather doubtful circumstances. I may as well tell you in confidence, Sir Eustace that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by the secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady. Where and how did you come to engage her?” “She was lent to me,” I replied coldly, “by your own Government.” He collapsed utterly. (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) As soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne. She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off en route.",0
"Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on board previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of the ship’s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why had they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should Cabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place on the Kilmorden Castle. I counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to keep a watch.",0
"Are you better tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it’s all about?” “I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.” “Why not?” I said, chagrined. He smiled nastily. “If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.” “Don’t you think I could keep a secret?” “I don’t think I know.” He rose to his feet. “At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events of this evening.” “I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently. “How dare you?” I cried angrily.",0
"The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed.",0
"Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.",0
"As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed.",0
"If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order.",0
"Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head the “Colonel” was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival. I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution. “There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace made his money!” “Suspecting him again?” “Suzanne, I’ve got into that state that I can’t help suspecting somebody! I don’t really suspect him but, after all, he is Pagett’s employer, and he did own the Mill House.” “I’ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn’t anxious to talk about,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean crime it might be tin-tacks or hair restorer!” I agreed ruefully. “I suppose,” said Suzanne doubtfully, “that we’re not barking up the wrong tree? Being led completely astray, I mean, by assuming Pagett’s complicity? Supposing that, after all, he is a perfectly honest man?” I considered that for a minute or two, then I shook my head. “I can’t believe that.” “After all, he has his explanations for everything.” “Y es, but they’re not very convincing. For instance, the night he tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden, he says he followed Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down. Now we know that’s not true.” “No,” said Suzanne unwillingly. “But we only heard the story at second-hand from Sir Eustace. If we’d heard it direct from Pagett himself, it might have been different. You know how people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.” I turned the thing over in my mind. “No,” I said at last, “I don’t see any way out. Pagett’s guilty. You can’t get away from the fact that he tried to throw me overboard, and everything else fits in. Why are you so persistent in this new idea of yours?” “Because of his face?” “His face? But” “Yes, I know what you’re going to say. It’s a sinister face. That’s just it. No man with a face like that could be really sinister. It must be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.” I did not believe much in Suzanne’s argument. I know a lot about Nature in past ages. If she’s got a sense of humour, she doesn’t show it much. Suzanne is just the sort of person who would clothe Nature with all her own attributes. We passed on to discuss our immediate plans.",0
"” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air. “Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “Parbleu! to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “After all, it does not matter now.” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections. “What is it that intrigues you so?” I told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully. “You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure that she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not of inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.” “You suspected her?” I cried. “But certainly! She benefits enormously in fact, by this new will, she is the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out for attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of examining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. Eh bien, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’ I had heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.” “Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured.",0
"Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.” The magistrate nodded. “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.” “What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.” “Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him to catch it.” “Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?” “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow. “Pardon, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you ” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside. He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. Eh bien! I must start again!” Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “Pauvre femme,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with three people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.” “But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.” “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed. “M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.” I gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had overlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was the body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I had a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity. The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name, and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye. “I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.” “Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate ” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.” “The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?” The other detective stared. “Of course.” A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying. “That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But you’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who used it wore gloves. Here they are.” He gesticulated with his foot to where two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “And they’re Renauld’s too or at least his gardener’s. I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always something! And I mean to find it.",0
"It’s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There’s to be money in it ” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.",0
"He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died. “I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death ‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.” “That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.” “I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.” “Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?” “No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.” “There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?” “I would not even attempt to do such a thing.” “You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle?” “That is exactly how I look upon it.” “It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.” “Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?” “Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.” “Have you the will or a copy of it with you?” Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it, nodding to himself. “Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also 11 a.m. that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made even half-an-hour later would upset this. Eh bien, mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!” (Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!) “Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?” “Yes, their name is Baker.” The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived late the night before. Mr.",0
"But what does he think he will find there?” I thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I drew myself up. “That I am not at liberty to say,” I said quietly. Giraud subjected me to a piercing stare. “He has probably enough sense not to tell you,” he remarked rudely. “Good afternoon. I’m busy.” And with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony. Matters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Geneviève. Giraud evidently did not desire my company and, from what I had seen, it seemed fairly certain that Jack Renauld did not either. I went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the hotel.",0
"“So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.” “En vérité! And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, mon cher?” I thought. “About a dozen times perhaps.” “And I once! Yet I recognize her, and you do not.” “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly. “Ah! Sacré!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.",0
"Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed maliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast. My friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful face upon me. “Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier? His system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “Quelle idée! You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.” “He did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot. I do not run to and fro, making journeys, and agitating myself. My work is done from within here ” he tapped his forehead significantly. As usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty. “It’s all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer.” “And has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked Poirot dryly. “But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules Poirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “Eh bien, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case.",0
"I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door.",0
"It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa.",0
"I hoped he had not recognized me, but from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is only too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, Miss Beddingfeld, with an abnormal sense of humour. It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts. Possibly he has known them for years.” I hoped that sooner or later I should be able to understand what Pagett was talking about.",0
"Thus, and in no other way, could there have been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. Poirot listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons would be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud. Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care, also the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at Giraud. “You saw these?” “Yes, I saw them,” replied the other. His face remained inscrutable. Suddenly Poirot stiffened. “Dr. Durand!” “Yes?” The doctor came forward. “There is foam on the lips. You observed it?” “I didn’t notice it, I must admit.” “But you observe it now?” “Oh, certainly.” Poirot again shot a question at Giraud. “You noticed it without doubt?” The other did not reply. Poirot proceeded. The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes.",0
"Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.” “Thank you,” I said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “Les Anglais!” he murmured. “No method absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. “Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told me, did you not?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “True, I forgot.” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot.",0
"She hadn’t time to take them out of the room. The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans. No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” “More than unlikely impossible!” said Poirot quietly. “Eh?” The inspector stared. Poirot smiled modestly. “I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case. I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say ‘Go!’” “Go!” I said. With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning. “Well, mon ami?” he demanded of me breathlessly. “Forty-six seconds,” I replied. “You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.” “Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door. Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen. “This necklace it was, without doubt, insured?” Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question. “Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.” “But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.” “I comprehend, madame,” said Poirot soothingly. “I comprehend perfectly. To la femme sentiment is everything is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact.” “Of course, of course,” said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. “Still” He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers. With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman. “Oh, oh, my necklace!” She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round. “Where was it?” demanded Opalsen. “Maid’s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.” “You permit, madame?” said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow. “I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time being,” said the inspector. “We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible.” Mr. Opalsen frowned.",0
"I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger. “Pardon,” cried Maître Grosíer. “I demand to speak to my client before he answers that question.” But Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched Grosíer. He waved him aside, and replied quietly: “Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as a souvenir of the War.” “Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in existence?” Again Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him. “Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.” Even the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply.",0
"If I were this young fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came asking questions about my love affairs. Later. It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear, but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored. The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable.  Johannesburg,  March 6th. There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different.",0
"“Miss Beddingfeld, you may not know it, but you are mixed up in a rather dangerous business.” “I gathered as much,” I said. “No, you don’t. You can’t possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave the whole thing alone. It can’t concern you really. Don’t let your curiosity lead you to tamper with other people’s business. No, please don’t get angry again. I’m not speaking of myself. You’ve no idea of what you might come up against these men will stop at nothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you’re in danger look at last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is to persuade them that they’re mistaken.",0
"Whether Luigi Valdarno was the thief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past Luigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the antecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about the time of Valdarno’s death.",0
"“There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last the day before yesterday the body of Mr. Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably. Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.” About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street. “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked. “First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.” The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell. We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner. Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind. “Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?” “You consider him a rich man, doctor?” The doctor looked rather surprised.",0
"“And you love me? Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which way to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!” Again I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could.",0
"We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. Ça vous dit quelque chose? I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini’s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?” I shook my head, utterly bewildered. “Come, I will help you.",0
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to the sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish, hiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre décors. In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It was the Manager.",0
"Then I saw.… “You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening?” “But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the 11:40.” My brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant anxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime.",0
"It looked angry revengeful.… “So good-bye,” she finished, in a lighter tone. “Aren’t you even going to tell me your name?” I cried, as she turned away. She looked over her shoulder. A dimple appeared in each cheek. She was like a lovely picture by Greuze. “Cinderella,” she said, and laughed. But little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again. It was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for breakfast on the following morning. My friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the shell of his second egg. He beamed upon me as I entered.",0
"My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I can’t resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it gives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn’t quite as clever as he thought himself, was he? I think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I’m sending you my diary. There’s nothing in it that would interest Race and his crowd, but I fancy that there are passages in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for the Daily Budget, “Criminals I have met.” I only stipulate that I shall be the central figure.",0
"They passed to Europe” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood.",0
"It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I understood everything understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last my own heart.… “Yes,” I said gently. “Is he looking for me?” she half whispered. Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big chair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping. I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair back from her face. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know I know everything.” “Oh, but you don’t!” “I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked: “It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action. “Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused.",0
"Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself on the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he wished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave the shed, Giraud approached us. “One more thing, M. Poirot,” he said, in his suave mocking voice. “We found this coiled round the handle of the dagger. A woman’s hair.” “Ah!” said Poirot. “A woman’s hair? What woman’s, I wonder?” “I wonder also,” said Giraud. Then, with a bow, he left us. “He was insistent, the good Giraud,” said Poirot thoughtfully, as we walked towards the hotel.",0
"""What?” “Imitation, mon ami.” The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!” “Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm. “Where?” “We must tell the Opalsens at once.” “I think not.” “But that poor woman” “Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.” “But the thief may escape with them!” “As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs.",0
"Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale.",0
"For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He stammered and flushed. “Oh, quite so, yes er quite so.” Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table. “I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race. “Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a stern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn’t been asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend. I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in sight.",0
"A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern. “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place. But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.” I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly. “A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye” He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words: “Key of Roll Top Desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys. “An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is also a young lady of method and order.” Baker came in answer to the bell. “Will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?” Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared the woman. “Cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.” Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms. “Two?” said Poirot sharply. “Yes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil one and sure enough, so he did do. Us had signed one” “What time of day was that?” Baker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker. “Why, to be sure, I’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven. Don’t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen.” “And afterwards?” “’Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. ‘I’ve made a mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. I’ll trouble you to sign again,’ and us did. And afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each. ‘I’ve left you nothing in my will,’ says he, ‘but each year I live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg when I’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.” Poirot reflected. “After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do you know?” “Went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.” That did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He held out the key of the desk. “Is that your master’s writing?” I may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed before Baker replied: “Yes, sir, it is.” “He’s lying,” I thought. “But why?” “Has your master let the house? have there been any strangers in it during the last three years?” “No, sir.” “No visitors?” “Only Miss Violet.” “No strangers of any kind been inside this room?” “No, sir.” “You forget the workmen, Jim,” his wife reminded him. “Workmen?” Poirot wheeled round on her. “What workmen?” The woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague as to what the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her master’s and quite unnecessary. Part of the time the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done there she could not say, as her master had not let either of them into the room whilst the work was in progress. Unfortunately, they could not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact that it was a Plymouth one. “We progress, Hastings,” said Poirot, rubbing his hands as the Bakers left the room. “Clearly he made a second will and then had workmen from Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead of wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will go to Plymouth.” With a little trouble, we were able to get the information we wanted. After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh. Their employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh’s orders. They remembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs, they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow. We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed. Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand.",0
"A secret meeting for orders!” “Don’t hiss at me, Pagett,” I said, drawing back a little, “and do control your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. “Something was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.” “You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only part of the story that he wasn’t vague about.",0
"” I was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this. “Your theory,” I remarked acidly, “is doubtless correct as to all the details?” “My theory is the truth,” said Poirot quietly. “And the truth is necessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You permitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight assignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we must take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to note down?” “The letter to you?” “That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning of the case. The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. “23rd May. M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. “24th May. M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “7th June. Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter written to M. Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance. “Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the Anzora to Buenos Ayres. “Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday. “Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are ‘Yes, yes but for God’s sake go now.…’” Poirot paused. “There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do not get new light on the matter.",0
"The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the Kilmorden seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr.",0
"“At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.” Pagett’s voice dropped again. “But that’s camouflage, I’m sure. So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck.",0
"I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily. “Where the devil did she go to that night, that’s what I’d like to know.” “She was on the island all the time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man on it?” “Yes.” “How very improper,” I said. “Pagett will be quite shocked. He always did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld. I suppose that was the young man she originally intended to meet in Durban?” “I don’t think so.” “Don’t tell me anything you don’t want to,” I said, by way of encouraging him. “I fancy that this is a young man we should all be very glad to lay our hands on.” “Not?” I cried, in rising excitement. He nodded. “Harry Rayburn, alias Harry Lucas that’s his real name, you know. He’s given us all the slip once more, but we’re bound to rope him in soon.” “Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying. Without stopping to reflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading statements, I gave myself up to the pleasure of scoring off Race. He is always so cocksure. I took the telegram from my pocket and handed it to him. “Then how do you explain this?” I asked nonchalantly. He seemed dumbfounded. “She said she was just starting for Beira,” he said, in a dazed voice. I know that Race is supposed to be clever. He is, in my opinion, rather a stupid man. It never seemed to occur to him that girls do not always tell the truth. “Kimberley too. What are they doing there?” he muttered. “Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the Daily Budget.” “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared.",0
"” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? Eh bien, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a cause célèbre unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after ” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind.",0
"“The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “Bien,” said Bex. “This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk. “Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.” Poirot laughed. “The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘Tiens! The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room must have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn up, and scattered on the floor. This morning ” But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell. Françoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove of course! What else? With a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her. Then, his face lightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the dead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was but how did you know?” “By this. I found it on the back of the leather chair.” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “Ma foi! but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.” “Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position. “He wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,” he remarked. “Yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.” At this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after him. He strode forward and opened it. Françoise was there. She endeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity. “Well, what is it?” demanded Bex impatiently. “Madame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite ready to receive the examining magistrate.” “Good,” said M. Bex briskly. “Tell M. Hautet and say that we will come at once.” Poirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But when he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. “He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly. We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman. She was middle-aged, and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call “une maitresse femme.” She greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head. “Pray be seated, monsieurs.” We took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a round table. “I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night?” “Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly assassins are to be caught and punished.” “Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.” “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.” “You mean they were false?” “Yes, madame. But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened desperately. “They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said. But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said. ‘The secret! Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.” “Pardon,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?” “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound and you are a dead man, remember.’ “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.” “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?” “None whatever, monsieur.” “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?” “Yes. I had seen the change in him.” “How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed. “He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.” Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction. “Mon Dieu!” he ejaculated. “What is it?” “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!” “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished. But Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled. “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.” The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?” Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly. “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.” With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory. “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all.",0
"The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hôtel du Phare, a very unpretentious building.",0
"” He looked down at the body again. “As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wore gloves.” “You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. “Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared at the doorway. “Monsieur?” “Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago?” “She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.” “Good. I only want one at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared again.",0
"It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.",0
"Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall. I looked round me and then caught my breath with a gasp.",0
"I avoided Carton carefully on board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under the pretence of illness. “I had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London. He went straight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day. He left the hotel shortly before one o’clock. I was behind him. He went straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying. It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House. I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton. I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner. He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films which I must have dropped somewhere later and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room God! It was horrible. Dead and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in. By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country. “I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.” “Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.” “He was supposed to be in Florence but he certainly never went there. I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved.",0
"“It is really insupportable,” he murmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!” “Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars that is, if you know!” “Eh bien, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!” “Do you know where he is hiding?” “Certainly! It is most ingenious.",0
"The bureau clerk from the hotel identified the man as having arrived the day before and booked a room under that name. He had registered as L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He had evidently come straight off the steamer. I was the only person who had seen anything of the affair. “You think it was an accident?” the coroner asked me. “I am positive of it. Something alarmed him, and he stepped backwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.” “But what could have alarmed him?” “That I don’t know. But there was something. He looked panic-stricken.” A stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats. The man might have seen a cat.",0
"It seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded at the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted a policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street with Miller and saw him. He’s sober enough now, and I don’t mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting he might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer one it is. “He was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins was his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a bad day, and was down on his luck.",0
"A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern. “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.",0
"Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “Pardon M. Hautet,” I cried, “but will you permit me to ask him one question?” “But certainly, monsieur.” Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. “Where do you keep your boots?” “Sac à papier!” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?” “But when you go to bed at night?” “Under my bed.” “But who cleans them?” “Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise !” he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. “Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and ” “You will not have to send far, M. le juge.” The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window. He leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table. “Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner.” “Not at all. Not at all,” said the magistrate, rather confused. “Of course I am only a detective,” continued the other. “I know nothing of interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do so without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.… But no matter.” M. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously, the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offence. “Eh bien, M. Giraud,” said the magistrate rather sharply. “Without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names of the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where they find themselves now?” Unmoved by this irony, Giraud replied: “I know at least where they have come from.” “Comment?” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders.",0
"In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell. My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned. “Here you are and here you stay,” he remarked facetiously. I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. “I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.",0
"But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy.” Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth. “It is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? But must I be bothered now so soon?” “Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the Company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have empowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you. Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?” “I was changing for tea when my maid came up one of the gardeners had just run to the house. He had found” Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically. “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?” “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.” “Shooting rooks, eh?” “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.” “Where is this little rook rifle now?” “In the hall, I think.” She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily. “Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see” He paused delicately. “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head. The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us. “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?” She shook her head. “Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.” “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.” “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was only too right!” Tears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together. “Eh bien, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears to be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet” “Yet what?” “A slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not? Still, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own life there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood.",0
"In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the papers.” “Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked.",0
"She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.” Denise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him. “Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?” Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely: “I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it.",0
"But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?” Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly. “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.” With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory. “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.",0
"” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime.",0
"” I did not reply. “Think you’ll never recover, eh? But I’ve seen people much worse than you, and two days later they were the life and soul of the ship. You’ll be the same.” I did not feel sufficiently pugnacious to tell him outright that he was a liar. I endeavoured to convey it by a glance. He chatted pleasantly for a few minutes more, then he mercifully departed. People passed and repassed, brisk couples “exercising,” curveting children, laughing young people. A few other pallid sufferers lay, like myself, in deck-chairs. The air was pleasant, crisp, not too cold, and the sun was shining brightly. Insensibly, I felt a little cheered. I began to watch the people. One woman in particular attracted me. She was about thirty, of medium height and very fair with a round dimpled face and very blue eyes. Her clothes, though perfectly plain, had that indefinable air of “cut” about them which spoke of Paris. Also, in a pleasant but self-possessed way, she seemed to own the ship! Deck stewards ran to and fro obeying her commands. She had a special deck-chair, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of cushions. She changed her mind three times as to where she would like it placed. Throughout everything she remained attractive and charming. She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world who know what they want, see that they get it, and manage to do so without being offensive. I decided that if I ever recovered but of course I shouldn’t it would amuse me to talk to her. We reached Madeira about midday. I was still too inert to move, but I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board and spread their merchandise about the decks. There were flowers too. I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly. When it came I enjoyed it. My attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a tall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day. I put him down at once as one of the strong, silent men of Rhodesia. He was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple, and was easily the best-looking man on board. When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my attractive woman was. “That’s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair. You must have read about her in the papers.” I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the polite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him.",0
"""If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.” “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same who accompanied him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?” Lord Estair smiled.",0
"And though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I went up to the Villa Geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. I did not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by the shed, and sat there moodily enough. I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand. In a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they were approaching rapidly. A girl’s voice was speaking, a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe.",0
"The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.” He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly. “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously. Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring: “Not precisely to-day,” he replied. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor.",0
"""Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror.",0
"“Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right.",0
"“Then, évidemment, we must find out just how we stand. When did Mr. Schneider’s death take place?” “Three days ago.” “You are sure it was tetanus?” “Dead sure.” “It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for instance?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a clear case of tetanus.” “Did you not inject anti-serum?” “Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing that could be done was tried.” “Had you the anti-serum with you?” “No. We procured it from Cairo.",0
"Two bells went overhead. One o’clock! And nothing. Wait what was that? I heard the quick light patter of feet running running along the passage. Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell inside. “Save me,” he said hoarsely. “They’re after me.” It was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear footsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act. I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the middle of the cabin. A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it under the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other hand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it was supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from her trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be suspected of harbouring a fugitive. There was a knock at the door, and without waiting for me to say, “Come in,” it was pushed open. I don’t know what I expected to see. I think I had vague ideas of Mr. Pagett brandishing a revolver. Or my missionary friend with a sandbag, or some other lethal weapon. But certainly I did not expect to see a night stewardess, with an inquiring face and looking the essence of respectability. “I beg your pardon, miss, I thought you called out.” “No,” I said, “I didn’t.” “I’m sorry for interrupting you.” “That’s all right,” I said. “I couldn’t sleep. I thought a wash would do me good.” It sounded rather as though it were a thing I never had as a general rule. “I’m so sorry, miss,” said the stewardess again. “But there’s a gentleman about who’s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies’ cabins and frighten them.” “How dreadful,” I said, looking alarmed. “He won’t come in here, will he?” “Oh, I don’t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.” “Good night.” I opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight. Drunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents had been wasted. I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and said: “Come out at once, please,” in an acid voice. There was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He did not move. “Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What am I to do?” Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor. Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough. He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade a nasty deep wound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it. At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up. “Keep still, please,” I said. He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a little. “Thank you, I don’t need anything done for me.” His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks of even common gratitude! “That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” He flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour of him. My temper, never placid, rose. “I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,” I said coldly. “I can at least relieve you of my presence.” He started for the door, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed him down upon the sofa. “Don’t be a fool,” I said unceremoniously. “You don’t want to go bleeding all over the ship, do you?” He seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as best I could. “There,” I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, “that will have to do for the present. Are you better tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it’s all about?” “I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.” “Why not?” I said, chagrined. He smiled nastily. “If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.” “Don’t you think I could keep a secret?” “I don’t think I know.” He rose to his feet. “At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events of this evening.” “I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently. “How dare you?” I cried angrily. We were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity of bitter enemies. For the first time, I took in the details of his appearance, the close-cropped dark head, the lean jaw, the scar on the brown cheek, the curious light grey eyes that looked into mine with a sort of reckless mockery hard to describe. There was something dangerous about him. “You haven’t thanked me yet for saving your life?” I said with false sweetness. I hit him there. I saw him flinch distinctly. Intuitively I knew that he hated above all to be reminded that he owed his life to me. I didn’t care. I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt any one so much. “I wish to God you hadn’t!” he said explosively. “I’d be better dead and out of it.” “I’m glad you acknowledge the debt. You can’t get out of it. I saved your life and I’m waiting for you to say ‘Thank you.’” If looks could have killed, I think he would have liked to kill me then. He pushed roughly past me. At the door he turned back, and spoke over his shoulder. “I shall not thank you now or at any other time. But I acknowledge the debt. Some day I will pay it.” He was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating like a mill race. There were no further excitements that night. I had breakfast in bed and got up late the next morning. Mrs. Blair hailed me as I came on deck. “Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though you hadn’t slept well.” “Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently. “Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t bore me to death to talk to.” “That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you only it’s more understandable in your case. You’re you’re such an exquisitely finished product.” “Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?” I told her something about Papa’s life work. “So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t a mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls?” “I may,” I said cautiously. “I’ve got other plans as well.” “What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning. Didn’t you sleep well? I can’t keep awake on board a boat. Ten hours’ sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!” She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten. “An idiot of a steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a moment!” “Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. “He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires you very much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.” “I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable than a hat.” I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something. I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been searching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the half-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my head, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else could there be? I wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had not really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on board previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of the ship’s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why had they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should Cabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place on the Kilmorden Castle. I counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to keep a watch. Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly. “But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.” “Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.” Mr. Chichester did not reply. “Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally. “To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.” “I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely it. Too much so perhaps. Was he or was he not just a little like a stage clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly. Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A a fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy. “But it is misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. “Aqua calda certainly ought to be cold water not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair. “They’re so obliging though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them the way somewhere, and instead of saying ‘first to the right, second to the left’ or something that one could follow, they pour out a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered they take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with you.” “Is that your experience in Florence, Pagett?” asked Sir Eustace, turning with a smile to his secretary. For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He stammered and flushed. “Oh, quite so, yes er quite so.” Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table. “I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs.",0
"A resident secretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the fact.” “You take my breath away,” I remarked. “Where has she been all these years?” “We have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow, quite close to the Mill House, for over five years.” “God bless my soul,” I muttered. “Any children?” “Four children, Sir Eustace.” I gazed at him in a kind of stupor. I might have known, all along, that a man like Pagett couldn’t have a guilty secret. The respectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That’s just the kind of secret he would have a wife and four children. “Have you told this to any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.” I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance. “I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now that you’ve blinking well torn it!” I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in. The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands. “Can I show you something? Furs, curios?” “I want something quite out of the ordinary,” I said. “It’s for a special occasion. Will you show me what you’ve got?” “Perhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties there?” That is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so clever. I followed him through the swinging portières.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even wept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I got my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell. I arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met by a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He had a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in the distance, and I asked him what it was. “Guns,” he answered laconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo’burg! I gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get there, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting time. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building. The door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter. I stood irresolute in the dingy square hall. The man passed me and threw open a door. “The young lady to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,” he said, and laughed. Thus announced, I passed in. The room was sparsely furnished and smelt of cheap tobacco smoke. Behind a desk a man sat writing. He looked up and raised his eyebrows. “Dear me,” he said, “if it isn’t Miss Beddingfeld!” “I must be seeing double,” I apologized. “Is it Mr. Chichester, or is it Miss Pettigrew? There is an extraordinary resemblance to both of them.” “Both characters are in abeyance for the moment. I have doffed my petticoats and my cloth likewise. Won’t you sit down?” I accepted a seat composedly. “It would seem,” I remarked, “that I have come to the wrong address.” “From your point of view, I am afraid you have. Really, Miss Beddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!” “It was not very bright of me,” I admitted meekly. Something about my manner seemed to puzzle him. “You hardly seem upset by the occurrence,” he remarked dryly. “Would my going into heroics have any effect upon you?” I asked. “It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute. “All this is very well in its way, but we must get to business. Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all. “I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I I excuse me” He bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly. Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy’s return. He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood. “Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?” I followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural. “Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,” he went on. “Minks is a fool. A clever actor but a fool. That was Minks you saw downstairs.” “Oh, really,” I said feebly. “And now,” said Sir Eustace cheerfully, “let’s get down to facts. How long have you known that I was the ‘Colonel’?” “Ever since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace nodded ruefully. “Yes, I told the fool he’d blinking well torn it. He didn’t understand of course. His whole mind was set on whether I’d recognized him. It never occurred to him to wonder what I was doing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was. I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.” He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind. “Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that. I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms heavily paid for to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt. I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped. To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.” “Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here I don’t want to rub it in in any way but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?” “It does not.” Sir Eustace sighed. “A pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose. You love another, as the books say.” “I love another.” “I thought as much first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it’s the young hero who fished you out of the Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two have half the brains that I have. I’m such an easy person to underestimate.” I think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the kind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize it. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had actually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless other deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to bring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as they deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of him and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson’s Long John Silver. He must have been much the same kind of man. “Well, well,” said this extraordinary person, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn’t appeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.” I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had seemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or would they not? “The fact of the matter is,” Sir Eustace was continuing, “I’ve a weakness for you. I really don’t want to proceed to extremes. Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let’s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind I want the truth.” I was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace’s shrewdness. It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning part, but I do. You’re the kind of girl who would start off like that at a moment’s notice, on the slenderest of motives. You’ve had amazing luck, of course, but sooner or later the amateur runs up against the professional and then the result is a foregone conclusion. I am the professional. I started on this business when I was quite a youngster. All things considered, it seemed to me a good way of getting rich quickly. I always could think things out, and devise ingenious schemes and I never made the mistake of trying to carry out my schemes myself. Always employ the expert that has been my motto. The one time I departed from it I came to grief but I couldn’t trust any one to do that job for me. Nadina knew too much. I’m an easy-going man, kind-hearted and good tempered so long as I’m not thwarted. Nadina both thwarted me and threatened me just as I was at the apex of a successful career. Once she was dead and the diamonds were in my possession, I was safe. I’ve come to the conclusion now that I bungled the job. That idiot Pagett, with his wife and family! My fault it tickled my sense of humour to employ the fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner’s face and his mid-Victorian soul. A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you.",0
"“Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does ” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother. The magistrate understood. “As yet no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?” “I have no idea whatsoever.” M. Hautet sighed. “A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis.",0
"Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wrist watch which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.",0
"Poirot only spent a few minutes at each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored. He whispered something to Norman, to which the latter replied: “Yes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by the bridge.” We turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a second car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men in plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we started off in a northerly direction, the other car following close behind.",0
"It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look at the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will realize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives. He knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over, vengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me to the real Mrs. Robinson that delightful and truthful creature! What will they think when they find their flat has been broken into! We must hurry back.",0
"Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory.",0
"“I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!” I pondered the matter. “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. Bonne mère, très femme!” “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.",0
"“Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well er I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence.",0
"The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story. “You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly.",0
"You know Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a house there!” But with an incoherent muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled. That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett.",0
"Poirot, you would without doubt like to visit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been removed, but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available.” “I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.” The commissary rose. “Come with me, monsieurs.” He opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him. Poirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary. “Monsieur.” “Monsieur.” At last they got out into the hall. “That room there, it is the study, hein?” asked Poirot suddenly, nodding towards the door opposite. “Yes.",0
"My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation.",0
"I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions.",0
"I don’t know what it’s all about.” “Don’t you? It means that I’ve found the ‘Colonel.’ It means that on January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It means that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned to do away with her and at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you.” “Indeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information? From the man who is even now being looked for by the police? His evidence will be very valuable.” “We have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.” Sir Eustace looked surprised.",0
"""In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company.",0
"” I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.” She shook her head vigorously. “What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile. “A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too. Italian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.” “I shan’t. I like you did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.” “Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I’m an actress. No not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six tumbling.” “I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled. “Haven’t you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I understand.” “I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now ” “We?” “My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in. It’s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There’s to be money in it ” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.” This glimpse of a world unknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid little face light up as she talked. We passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories. My companion seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind. “Thinking of the War?” I nodded. “You were through it, I suppose?” “Pretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me out altogether. I had a half fledged Army job for a bit. I’m a sort of private secretary now to an M. P.” “My! That’s brainy!” “No, it isn’t. There’s really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of hours every day sees me through. It’s dull work too. In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the papers.” “Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked. “Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.” Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion. “Where’s my powder-puff?” She proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of lip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass, and betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness. “I say,” I hesitated. “I dare say it’s cheek on my part, but why do all that sort of thing?” The girl paused in her operations, and stared at me with undisguised surprise. “It isn’t as though you weren’t so pretty that you can afford to do without it,” I said stammeringly. “My dear boy! I’ve got to do it. All the girls do. Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the mirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag. “That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.” “Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?” “Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.” “Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I ” I hesitated. “I want to meet your sister.” We both laughed. “That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy we’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey, especially after I cheeked you as I did.",0
"He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo’burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn’t seen him this morning. “You understand, don’t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.” He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. “I understand,” I said gratefully. “And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.” “No, of course not.” “You know his real name?” The question surprised me. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar. “Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?” “Of course I remember.” “I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.” “Was that what you meant?” “Of course.” I hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained. He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: “When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted me. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing. But youth’s call to youth. I’ve still got my work.” I was silent. I suppose one can’t really love two men at once but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I looked up at him suddenly. “I think that you’ll go very far,” I said dreamily. “I think that you’ve got a great career ahead of you. You’ll be one of the world’s big men.” I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. “I shall be alone, though.” “All the people who do really big things are.” “You think so?” “I’m sure of it.” He took my hand and said in a low voice: “I’d rather have had the other.” Then Harry came striding round the corner of the house. Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War. This is John Harold Eardsley.” With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry’s voice recalled me to myself. “Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.” He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away. “Why did you deceive me?” “I don’t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that sort of thing the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself for the man I was without ornaments and trappings.” “You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. “How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered. “But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.” “And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race.",0
"” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil.",0
"But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.” He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. “Information?” “Something of the kind.” “Diamonds,” I said to myself. “And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.” For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables.",0
"“The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: “‘Yeas yeas butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’” “Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, voilà tout! So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday. A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes. “What is it?” I whispered. He shook his head impatiently, and asked a question: “Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself?” The commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied promptly: “No, Monsieur did not drive himself.” Poirot’s frown deepened. “I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently. “See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.” “Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested. “Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your own. Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a holiday suddenly, at a moment’s notice? Was it that for some reason he wanted him out of the way before we arrived?” Françoise had left the room. The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully on the table. “M. Bex,” he said at length, “here we have directly conflicting testimony. Which are we to believe, Françoise or Denise?” “Denise,” said the commissary decidedly. “It was she who let the visitor in. Françoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a dislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show that Renauld was entangled with another woman.” “Tiens!” cried M. Hautet. “We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it.",0
"""What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question.",0
"She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that it is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand, Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could. All this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne’s full approval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a psychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards).",0
"The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the crime passionnel is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.” “But what about the crime passionnel? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head.",0
"But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth.",0
"At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it.",0
"Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted.",0
"""English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.",0
"“Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.” Poirot was right. He always is, confound him! The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the following day.",0
