"In the quaint village of St. Mary Mead, where gossip was as common as afternoon tea, there lived a detective whose sharp mind was as celebrated as the roses in Mrs. Bantry's garden. His name was Inspector Edward Hastings, and his reputation for solving the most perplexing of mysteries preceded him. One brisk autumn morning, as the golden leaves danced in the wind, a peculiar case found its way to Inspector Hastings' desk. It was a case that would challenge even his keen intellect. The esteemed heiress, Miss Arabella Fairchild, had vanished without a trace. Miss Fairchild, known for her exquisite beauty and vast fortune, was last seen attending a soirée at the grand estate of Lord and Lady Ashford. ",1
"Yet, when the guests bid their farewells and the moon hung high in the sky, Miss Fairchild was nowhere to be found. With whispers of foul play echoing through the village, Inspector Hastings wasted no time in assembling his clues. He meticulously combed through the evidence, questioning the guests and scrutinizing every detail of the evening's events. Among the suspects was Sir Reginald Blackwood, a suave gentleman with a penchant for gambling and debts that rivaled the national deficit. Then there was Lady Penelope Everingham, whose envy of Miss Fairchild's beauty was as palpable as the disdain in her icy gaze. As Inspector Hastings delved deeper into the mystery, he uncovered a tangled web of deceit and betrayal.",1
"Alibis crumbled like sandcastles before the tide, and secrets long buried began to surface. With his trusty sidekick, Constable Jenkins, by his side, Inspector Hastings pursued the truth with unwavering determination. Together, they followed the faintest of trails, from the opulent ballrooms of the aristocracy to the dimly lit alleyways where whispers lingered like ghosts. In the end, it was a single overlooked detail that brought the case to its dramatic conclusion. A misplaced handkerchief, embroidered with the initials 'A.F.', led Inspector Hastings to a secluded cottage on the outskirts of the village. ",1
"There, hidden away from prying eyes, Miss Arabella Fairchild sat, a prisoner in her own home. It was her own cousin, Evelyn Fairchild, consumed by jealousy and greed, who had orchestrated her disappearance in a bid to claim her inheritance. With the culprit unmasked and justice served, St. Mary Mead breathed a collective sigh of relief. And as the autumn leaves gave way to the gentle embrace of winter, Inspector Hastings returned to his modest cottage, content in the knowledge that order had been restored to the idyllic village he called home.

It was a case that would challenge her deductive prowess like never before. The esteemed Lady Margaret Worthington, matriarch of the Worthington family, sought Inspector Holmes' assistance when her prized heirloom, a rare diamond necklace, vanished from the family vault without a trace.

"In the bustling streets of London, where fog veiled the city in mystery, Detective Inspector Arthur Sinclair was known for his unyielding resolve and sharp intellect. It was on a chilly evening in November that a peculiar case landed on his desk, destined to test his mettle. The renowned author, Mr. Edgar Wentworth, sought Inspector Sinclair's aid when his latest manuscript, a literary masterpiece shrouded in secrecy, disappeared from his study.

"“Say you’re sorry about my sister ” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have.",0
"“So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.",0
"Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.” “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr.",0
"It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter.",0
"“There will be no objection to my er calling in this gentleman, I suppose?” “None at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. “Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just let us have the facts?” Mrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her chair. “Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself.” Thus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began. “I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room as usual” “Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mr. Opalsen explained.",0
"It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot.",0
"A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown” was returned, and the police (and the Daily Budget_) were left to look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out.",0
"""That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least ” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M.",0
"” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas. And if some little fact will not fit in do not reject it but consider it closely.",0
"A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.” “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?” “My dear sir, I never attended him.” “What?” “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist or something of that kind.” “But you examined the body?” “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.” “And the cause of death was clear?” “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.” “Was he still lying where he had been found?” “Yes, the body had not been touched.",0
