"""Perhaps in the future, I could facilitate a marriage suitable for you."" ""I appreciate the offer,"" I chuckled, ""but marriage is not on my mind."" Poirot let out a sigh and shook his head. ""The English!"" he muttered. ""They rely too much on chance."" He furrowed his brow and adjusted the salt shaker. ""You mentioned Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at Hôtel d’Angleterre, correct?"" ""No, she's at Hôtel du Phare."" ""Ah, I stand corrected."" A brief moment of doubt crossed my thoughts. Had I disclosed the hotel information to Poirot before?",1
"""You can mock all you want, but I refuse to be the next target of that cursed Men-her-Ra. If I stay here, he will come after me."" The young man wiped his brow, sweat dripping down his face. Poirot looked away, a strange smile playing on his lips. ""Don't forget, he claimed a victim in New York,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Oh, damn!"" Mr. Harper exclaimed forcefully. ""That young man is clearly on edge,"" Poirot observed thoughtfully. ""Teetering right on the edge."" I glanced at Poirot, intrigued by his mysterious smile, but it revealed nothing. Accompanied by Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill, we were guided through the excavation site.",1
"“You slept well, correct? Have you recovered from the dreadful crossing? You appear almost normal this morning. Excuse me, but your tie is askew. Allow me to fix it for you.” I have previously introduced Hercule Poirot. A remarkable individual! Standing at five feet four inches tall, with an egg-shaped head tilted slightly to one side, eyes that gleamed green in excitement, a stiff military moustache, and a profound air of dignity! He was always impeccably dressed. Neatness was his absolute obsession. Any hint of disorder or dirt was unbearable to him until he could rectify the situation.",1
"“But it’s been a happy time, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been a nightmare!”“Really that bad?”“Why do you keep torturing me? Are you making fun of me? Why are you saying that with a smile on your face?”“I wasn’t smiling. And I’m not trying to mock you. If you want me to leave, I will. But if you want me to stay, I’ll stay.”“Don’t say that!” he exclaimed passionately. “Don’t say that. Don’t tempt me, Sarah. Do you understand who I am? A criminal with a target on my back. Everyone here knows me as John Smith, they believe I’ve been on a trip inland, but soon they might figure it out and then everything will come crashing down.”",1
"""Should we succeed, our fortunes will be made!” “Don't count your chickens before they hatch, my friend. Wealthy individuals are not quick to part with their money. I once witnessed a well-known millionaire emptying a tram full of people in search of a dropped halfpenny.” I agreed with the sentiment. “Regardless,” Poirot continued, “money is not what draws me in. While having unlimited resources for our investigation will be enjoyable and efficient, there is something peculiar about this case that piques my curiosity. Did you notice the postscript? What were your thoughts?” I pondered.",1
"""Remember, not a single word to anyone,"" Sir Eustace paused. ""I trust your creative flair to add the finishing touches,"" he added. ""Just ensure there are no errors."" ""Simply sign it 'With eternal love, Anne,'"" I suggested. As I penned the words, Sir Eustace reached for the letter and scanned it. ""Looks good. Now, the destination."" I disclosed the address of a discreet shop known for handling mail and messages. Sir Eustace rang the bell on the table. Chichester-Pettigrew, also known as Minks, appeared promptly. ""Send this letter through the usual channels without delay,"" Sir Eustace instructed.",1
"""I was clearly inebriated when I approached Race. Clearly. Mark my words, Pagett, let your bruised eye serve as a cautionary tale, abstain from excessive drinking in the future."" ""As you are aware, I abstain from alcohol, Sir Eustace."" ""It's much wiser to commit to sobriety if you struggle with such temptations. Have I approached anyone else, Pagett?"" ""Not to my knowledge, Sir Eustace."" I breathed a sigh of relief. ""There's Miss Beddingfeld,"" I mused. ""She's eager to travel to Rhodesia for archaeological excavations, I believe. I'm considering offering her a temporary position as a secretary.""",1
"""The lady is without doubt young and beautiful, n’est-ce pas? What it is to be young! O jeunesse, jeunesse!” And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.” “That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least ” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M. le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “Eh bien! I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M. Hautet addressed us: “Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air. “Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “Parbleu! to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “After all, it does not matter now.” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections. “What is it that intrigues you so?” I told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully. “You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure that she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not of inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.” “You suspected her?” I cried. “But certainly! She benefits enormously in fact, by this new will, she is the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out for attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of examining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. Eh bien, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’ I had heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.” “Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly. “So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? Eh bien, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a cause célèbre unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after ” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind. “But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced. But I essayed one final objection: “And the match and cigarette end found near the body? What of them.” A light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot’s face. “Planted! Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to find! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good retriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has crawled on his stomach. ‘See what I have found,’ he says. And then again to me: ‘What do you see here?’ Me, I answer, with profound and deep truth, ‘Nothing.’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he thinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ But we shall see.…” But my mind had reverted to the main facts. “Then all this story of the masked men ?” “Is false.” “What really happened?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “One person could tell us Madame Renauld. But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my opinion.” “What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body. I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.” “Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.” “I beg your pardon, my friend one can always be mistaken. Regard a great actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment possibly with the murderer leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery.",1

"""Rage coursed through me at the sight of the lifeless woman. I felt the urge to end her existence right then and there. But how could he have ever loved her to feel such intense emotions? I composed myself and calmly spoke, 'It seems we have nothing left to discuss. Good night.' 'Good night and farewell, Miss Beddingfeld.' 'Until we meet again, Mr. Lucas.' The mention of his name caused him to recoil. He approached me. 'Why do you say we will meet again?' 'Because I have a feeling our paths will cross once more.' 'Not if I have a say in it!' His words were forceful, but I remained unfazed.""",1
"A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. If only I could find a way to save them both.",1
"I wrenched a dagger out of his grasp, and while Poirot revealed his eyes by lowering the scarf covering them but leaving his mouth bound, I raised my gun in plain sight to convey the futility of resistance. As he stopped fighting, Poirot leaned in close to whisper urgently in his ear. Within a minute, the man signaled his understanding. Poirot then gestured for silence and led us out of the apartment and down the staircase. Our prisoner trailed behind, with me bringing up the rear armed with the gun. Once we reached the street, Poirot turned to me. “A taxi is waiting just around the bend. Hand over the gun.”",1
"I had never encountered someone so ignorant, mistaking the superstitions of the Middle Ages for the beliefs of Ancient Egypt. It was a jumble of misinformation and gullibility. After calming down the eager specialist, I accompanied Poirot into the tent. My dear friend was grinning from ear to ear. ""We can finally rest easy now,"" he announced with joy. ""I could really use some rest. My head is pounding relentlessly. How I long for a soothing herbal tea!"" As if by magic, the tent flap opened and Hassan entered, carrying a cup of steaming tea which he handed to Poirot. It turned out to be chamomile tea, a drink that Poirot absolutely adored.",1
"""Madame, may I?"" He accepted the jewel, examining it closely before handing it back with a nod. ""A truly flawless gem. Ah, heavens! And to think you carry it with you, like this!"" ""No, no, I am very cautious, Monsieur Poirot. Normally, it is secured in my jewel case, kept in the hotel safe. We are staying at the Luxurious, you see. I only brought it today for your inspection."" ""And you will entrust it to me, will you not? You will heed the advice of Papa Poirot?"" ""Well, you see, Monsieur Poirot, it's like this.""",1
"""I am not sure,"" the boy replied. The table in front of him was cluttered with various items that he absentmindedly played with. Inspector Giraud demanded a response from him, addressing him as M. Renauld. In frustration, the boy angrily knocked a heavy paper-knife off the table. ""Fine, you want to know? Yes, I fought with my father. I probably said all those horrible things you mentioned. I was so mad, I can't even recall my exact words! I was beyond furious - I felt like I could have done something terrible in that moment. Happy now?"" The boy leaned back in his seat, looking flushed and unapologetic.",1
"”I was led into a dingy apartment by him, a young Kafir boy carrying my small suitcase, while Sir Eustace, with a polite demeanor, offered to fulfill any of my requests before leaving. A can of steaming water sat on the washstand, prompting me to unpack my essentials. Among them, an unexpected item awaited me inside my sponge-bag - a small pearl-handled revolver. The loaded weapon surprised me, as it was not there when I departed from Kimberley. Despite my initial shock, I couldn't help but feel a sense of security holding it in my hands. In a place like this, such a tool could prove to be quite handy.”",1
"”Mrs. Robinson paused for a breath, then continued: “We expressed our gratitude and explained that we understood it might not work out, but we still wanted to place an order just in case. We promptly took a taxi to No. 4 on the second floor. While waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson, a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, who was also in the market for an apartment, hurried down the stairs. ‘You’re a step behind this time, my dear,’ she remarked. ‘Unfortunately, it’s already been rented.’ It appeared hopeless, but John suggested that since the rent was so low, we could offer more money, possibly even a premium.”",1
"Poirot revealed the shocking truth to Jack Renauld about his father's past, leading Jack to make a life-changing decision. Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and secretary, leaving behind a girl who loves him dearly. Poirot encouraged Jack to be honest with the girl and let her decide. Despite his doubts, Jack realized that true love conquers all and decided to pursue a future with her. As for Captain Hastings, his future plans remain uncertain, but the story ends with a light-hearted moment between him and a familiar face.",1
"""Without fail, Poirot's intuition proved correct. Soon after, the famous American movie star entered the room, prompting us to stand up in respect. Mary Marvell was undeniably one of the most beloved actresses in Hollywood. She had recently arrived in England with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, who was also a well-known actor. Their wedding had occurred just a year earlier in the United States, marking their inaugural trip to England. The couple had been warmly welcomed by the public. Mary Marvell's stunning attire, luxurious furs, and exquisite jewelry, particularly a diamond known as ""the Western Star,"" had captivated everyone's attention.""",1
"""I do not threaten you with the gallows, but with the power of publicity. Your only chance is to be honest with me, Signor. I know you came to England to see Count Foscatini. You visited him on Tuesday morning and paid him a large sum of money for certain papers. The money was in Italian notes of small denomination. You left with the papers and never saw him again. When asked about the events of the evening, you claim someone must have impersonated you. But remember, the window-curtains were not drawn that evening, and it was still light outside at eight o'clock in June. Does that trigger any memories for you? Your story aligns with what I had suspected, Signor Ascanio. Good morning.""",1
"I glanced at the paper in my hand, the key to the mystery. The numbers and words held a secret waiting to be unraveled. Kilmorden Castle, a place shrouded in intrigue and possibilities. A buried treasure, a missing heir, a claimant to a title. The numbers, a cryptic message or a mere diversion? I needed to get to the bottom of this, to explore every avenue until the truth revealed itself. The journey ahead was fraught with obstacles, but I was determined to see it through to the end. The pieces of the puzzle were scattered, waiting for me to put them together and reveal the hidden truth.",1
"Poirot examined it closely before removing it from the lock. The words ""Key to Roll Top Desk"" were scribbled on it in messy handwriting, a stark contrast to the tidy writing on the other keys. ""This is unfamiliar,"" Poirot remarked with a furrowed brow. ""I would wager that this does not belong to Mr. Marsh. But who else has been inside the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I am not mistaken, is a young woman of precision and organization."" At that moment, Baker entered the room in response to the bell. ""Could you please bring madame your wife and assist with some inquiries?"" Baker left and quickly returned with Mrs.",1
"Upon unraveling the mystery, it became clear that de Castina, or whoever she truly was, had arranged to rendezvous at the Mill House. The pieces fell into place as I deduced their clever tactic of obtaining simultaneous house viewings to avoid suspicion. The sudden encounter between the ""doctor"" and the Moth Ball man indicated an unforeseen and unsettling turn of events. With the disguise discarded, the ""doctor"" discreetly trailed the woman to Marlow, leaving a trail of unanswered questions in their wake.",1
"""She lowered her gaze, seemingly filled with shame, and whispered in a trembling voice: “You can't, you can't... not if you knew.” Then, with sudden determination, she looked me straight in the eye and demanded: “What do you know?” “I know you visited Mr. Renauld that evening. He offered you a check which you tore up in a fit of rage. After that, you left the premises.” I hesitated. “What happened next?” “I'm not sure if you were expecting Jack Renauld to arrive that night, or if you simply lingered in the hopes of seeing him, but linger you did. Perhaps you were feeling lost and wandered aimlessly, but regardless, just before midnight, you were still in the vicinity and spotted a figure on the golf course.” Once more, I fell silent.""",1
"""Yet another bill. It seems I've developed a taste for extravagance in my later years. Oh, what's this? A note from Japp."" I perked up, intrigued. The Scotland Yard Inspector had previously involved us in some intriguing cases. ""He's simply expressing his gratitude (in his own way) for a small detail I provided in the Aberystwyth Case. I'm pleased to have been able to assist him."" ""And how did he express his thanks?"" I inquired, knowing Japp's style. ""He was gracious enough to commend me for still being a keen player in the game at my age, and he appreciated the opportunity to involve me in the case.""",1
"However, despite the gossip, there were many who claimed that young Conneau was not the only one who held Madame Beroldy's affections. Approximately three months after the Beroldys arrived in Paris, another notable figure entered the picture. Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a wealthy American, found himself captivated by the charming and enigmatic Madame Beroldy. His admiration for her was clear, yet always maintained a sense of respect. As time passed, Madame Beroldy began to confide in a few close friends, expressing her concerns for her husband's well-being.",1
"""Absolutely marvelous!"" whispered Poirot. ""Certainly a top-notch love story."" He glanced at Mary Marvell. ""And are you not scared, madam? No superstitions haunting you? Not a hint of fear in introducing these Siamese twins to each other in case a Chinese man emerges and, presto! whisks them away to China?"" Though his voice was teasing, I sensed a hint of gravity beneath. ""I highly doubt Lady Yardly's diamond compares to mine,"" Miss Marvell declared. ""But I intend to find out.""",1
"""What is that?” “Jack Renauld was likely familiar with the layout of the golf course. He anticipated the body being found quickly once they began to dig the bunker.” Giraud burst into laughter. “But that's absurd! He wanted the body to be discovered! Until then, death couldn't be assumed, preventing him from inheriting.” A flash of green appeared in Poirot's eyes as he stood up. “So why bury it?” he inquired softly. “Think about it, Giraud.",1
"A large settee covered in chintz sat against the wall, the window seats also upholstered in the same faded fabric. Poirot, with his small cigarette in hand, discussed their plan of action. The key to their investigation, he believed, lay within this room. They would carefully examine the desk's documents for any hidden clues. After some questioning, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen from Plymouth to create a secret compartment in the fireplace. With this new lead, they set off to Plymouth to uncover the truth.",1
"I never considered myself to be particularly attractive. My features were far from the ideal standards of beauty - no straight Grecian nose or rosebud mouth for me. The only compliment I ever received was from a curate who compared my eyes to ""imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood"", but I always suspected he had a quote ready for every occasion. Personally, I would have preferred Irish blue eyes over my dark green ones with yellow flecks. However, green does have a certain allure for women of intrigue. Wrapping myself in a black garment, I left my arms and shoulders exposed. Tucking my hair behind my ears, I applied a generous amount of powder to my face, giving my skin an unnaturally pale complexion.",1
"""But witnessing him standing there, pale and lifeless next to the wall, and listening to the incriminating confession escape from his mouth, all my doubts vanished. Poirot, however, directed his attention towards Giraud. “On what basis are you detaining him?” “Do I need to disclose that information to you?” “It would be appreciated as a gesture of respect,” insisted Poirot. Giraud hesitated, torn between outright refusal and the satisfaction of outsmarting his opponent. “You believe I have erred, don't you?” he taunted. “It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility,” Poirot retorted, a hint of mischief in his tone. A deeper shade of red crept onto Giraud's face. “Well then, step inside.""",1
"At the trial, the prisoner Renauld sat nervously next to his lawyer, Maître Grosíer. A stern guard, armed with a gleaming sabre, stood watch by the door, while the diligent greffier busied himself at his desk. The magistrate wasted no time. ""Renauld,"" he interrogated, ""do you still claim you were in Cherbourg on the night of the crime, despite all evidence pointing to Merlinville?"" Jack hesitated, his voice trembling as he repeated, ""I told you, I was in Cherbourg."" Maître Grosíer's expression darkened, a mix of frustration and disappointment.",1
"""He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind. “Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that. I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms heavily paid for to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt. I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped. To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.” “Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here I don’t want to rub it in in any way but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?” “It does not.” Sir Eustace sighed. “A pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose. You love another, as the books say.” “I love another.” “I thought as much first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it’s the young hero who fished you out of the Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two have half the brains that I have. I’m such an easy person to underestimate.” I think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the kind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize it. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had actually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless other deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to bring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as they deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of him and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson’s Long John Silver. He must have been much the same kind of man. “Well, well,” said this extraordinary person, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn’t appeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.” I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had seemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or would they not? “The fact of the matter is,” Sir Eustace was continuing, “I’ve a weakness for you. I really don’t want to proceed to extremes. Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let’s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind I want the truth.” I was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace’s shrewdness. It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning part, but I do. You’re the kind of girl who would start off like that at a moment’s notice, on the slenderest of motives.",1
"The bonds were last seen in the London and Scottish Bank office on the morning of the 23rd. However, they mysteriously reappeared in New York shortly after the Olympia docked, prompting speculation about their true whereabouts. One theory suggested that the bonds never actually made it onto the Olympia at all. Could they have been transported to New York by another means? Indeed, the Gigantic set sail from Southampton on the same day as the Olympia, boasting the fastest Atlantic crossing time. If the bonds were mailed on the Gigantic, they would have arrived in New York a day before the Olympia.",1
"""They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my er experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “Pardon! But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “Toqué!” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “Toqué!” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting. Eh bien, once or twice, your manner has annoyed me.” “I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.” “He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me.",1

"“1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs.",1
"""You're a female."" ""Your image of a woman is someone who jumps on a chair and screams at the sight of a mouse. That's ancient history. But you will give me a tour, won't you? You see, it could greatly benefit me."" ""How so?"" ""They're excluding all the journalists. I could get a major scoop with one of the newspapers. You have no idea how much they pay for insider information."" I hesitated. She slipped her small, soft hand into mine. ""Please, be a dear."" I agreed. Privately, I knew that I would actually enjoy playing the role of a guide. The girl's moral stance was none of my concern. I was a bit anxious about what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself that no harm could be done. We first went to where the body was found. A man was standing guard there, saluting respectfully, recognizing me and not questioning my companion. He must have seen her as being vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella how the discovery was made, and she listened attentively, asking intelligent questions. Then we headed towards the Villa. I proceeded cautiously, not eager to encounter anyone. I took the girl through the shrubbery to the back of the house where the small shed was located. I remembered that M. Bex had left the key with the police officer Marchaud, ""in case M. Giraud needed it while we were upstairs."" I thought it likely that the Sûreté detective had returned it to Marchaud after using it. Leaving the girl hidden in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was standing outside the door of the salon. I requested the key to the shed outside. He handed it to me, mentioning that all facilities were at my disposal. I realized that in Marchaud's eyes, I held equal importance to Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She was delighted to see the key in my hand. ""You've obtained it?"" ""Of course,"" I replied calmly. ""However, what I'm doing is highly irregular."" ""You've been wonderful, and I won't forget it. Let's go. They can't see us from the house, can they?"" ""Wait,"" I stopped her eager advance. ""I won't stop you if you really want to go in. But do you? You've seen the grave, the grounds, and heard all the details of the case. Isn't that enough for you? This will be gruesome and unpleasant."" She looked at me for a moment with an expression I couldn't quite understand. Then she laughed. ""I'm up for the horrors,"" she said. ""Let's go."" We arrived at the shed in silence. I uncovered the body, revealing that he was stabbed in the back. Her voice was barely audible. ""With what?"" I gestured towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Suddenly, the girl staggered and collapsed. I hurried to her aid. ""You're faint. Let's leave. It's been too much for you."" ""Water,"" she whispered. ""Quick. Water...""",1
"Or, at leastThere I was again dreaming! The real problem was what to do _now! I, priding myself upon my rôle of watcher, had become the watched. And I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve. I was the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of the great machine and I fancied that the machine would have a short way with little bits of grit. Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once I had saved myself but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily against me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and they were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter. I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so. In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform. A porter tried to stop me, but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the footboard. I mounted the two steps and opened the gate. I was safe! The train was gathering way. We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I waved to him. “Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,” I shouted. Never have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he had seen a ghost. In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily.",1
"I found myself at the mercy of my captor, an experience reminiscent of the dramatic scenes from “The Perils of Pamela.” The thrilling adventures I had once fantasized about were now unfolding before my eyes, but reality was proving to be far less entertaining. The words of Rayburn echoed in my mind, urging me to tell the truth. But would anyone believe the outlandish tale of how I ended up in this predicament? As I pondered my next move, my captor's menacing grin sent a shiver down my spine. I attempted to maintain a facade of confidence, mentioning my supposed whereabouts to buy some time. However, as the harsh reality of my situation set in, I knew that I was in for a long and arduous night.",1
"Poirot's experience as an examining magistrate gives him a discernment and flair that sets him apart. He is polite in an old-school manner and willing to help his friend in any way. Poirot and his friend encounter Giraud, who is dandified and pleased with himself. Giraud teases Poirot about his return from England and his confidence in solving the case. Poirot challenges Giraud to a wager to find the murderer first, showing a dangerous light in his eyes. Despite Giraud's insults, Poirot remains determined to prove Jack Renauld's innocence.

"“You can guess, I dare say. But mark my words, I will vindicate myself, or meet my demise in the pursuit, and I will strangle the wretch who attempted to end your life the other evening.” “Let us be just,” I remarked. “He never physically shoved me.” “He didn’t need to. His scheme was more cunning than that. I inspected the path later on. Everything appeared normal, but from the indentations on the ground I deduced that the stones bordering the path had been lifted and repositioned slightly. There are lofty shrubs growing right at the edge.”",1
"I must admit that after the first jolt of the Kilmorden, I quickly retreated below deck. A kind stewardess took me in, recommending dry toast and ginger ale. For three days, I remained confined to my cabin, consumed by misery. My passion for solving mysteries had vanished, leaving behind a shell of the once eager Anne who had rushed to South Kensington. Now, as I reflect on my return, I can't help but smile at the memory of Mrs. Flemming in the drawing-room, waiting to speak with me.",1
"“I could have sworn it was the master, the resemblance was uncanny.” Mrs. Maltravers jumped in fear, reminding me of the old belief that spirits of suicides are restless. She seemed to share the same thought, as moments later she grabbed Poirot's arm in a panic. ""Did you not hear that? Three taps on the window? That was his signature signal when he roamed the premises."" ""It was just the ivy brushing against the glass,"" I interjected. However, an unsettling fear began to grip us all. The parlourmaid was visibly shaken, and after dinner, Mrs. Maltravers begged Poirot to delay his departure. She was clearly petrified at the thought of being alone. We all gathered in the cozy morning-room.",1
"""Blair? I suddenly lunged towards her, my hands trembling with excitement. “The films you received through the ventilator on the 22nd, do you still have them?” “The ones I lost?” “How can you be sure they were returned to you the same way in the middle of the night? It doesn’t make sense. No, they were a message. The films had been replaced by something else. Do you still have it?” “I might have used it. Wait, here it is. I remember tossing it into the rack next to the bunk.” She handed it to me. It was a typical round tin cylinder used for packing films in tropical areas. As I took it, my heart pounded in anticipation. The tin felt heavier than it should have been. With shaking hands, I removed the adhesive strip keeping it sealed. I opened the lid, and a cascade of dull glassy pebbles spilled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, feeling disappointed. “Pebbles?” exclaimed Suzanne, her voice filled with excitement. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!"" Diamonds! I gazed at the glassy heap on the bunk, feeling a surge of fascination. I picked up what looked like a piece of broken glass, its weight confirming its authenticity. “Are you certain, Suzanne?” “Absolutely, my dear. I’ve seen rough diamonds too many times to doubt. They are exquisite, Anne, and some of them are truly unique. There’s a story behind these.” “The story we heard tonight,” I realized. “You think?” “Colonel Race’s tale. It cannot be a mere coincidence. He shared it with a purpose.” “To observe its impact, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But a seed of doubt crept in. Was Sir Eustace the intended target of the test, or was the story meant for me? I recalled the feeling of being probed on a previous occasion. Colonel Race was clearly suspicious for some reason. But how did he fit into all of this? “Who is Colonel Race?” I inquired. “That’s a loaded question,” Suzanne replied. “He’s known for his big-game hunting and, as he mentioned tonight, he was distantly related to Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never met him until now. He travels frequently to and from Africa. There are rumors of him being involved in Secret Service work, but whether it’s true or not remains unknown. He’s quite the enigmatic figure.” “I assume he inherited a significant sum from Sir Laurence Eardsley?” “Oh, Anne, he must be quite wealthy. He would make an excellent match for you.” “I can’t pursue him with you around,” I teased. “Oh, the challenges of being a married woman!” “We do have our advantages,” Suzanne said smugly. “And everyone knows how devoted I am to Clarence, my husband. It’s safe and pleasant to be loved by a devoted wife.” “Clarence must be lucky to have you as his wife.” “Well, I can be quite demanding to live with! But he always has the option of escaping to the Foreign Office, where he can adjust his eyeglass and doze off in a comfortable armchair. Maybe we should cable him to gather information on Race.”",1
"""Upon receiving his assurance, we bid him farewell. True to his word, a hastily written message arrived the next day around eleven. It simply read, 'The Dulcibella Sisters performing at the Palace in Coventry. Best of luck.' Without hesitation, we immediately set off for Coventry. Poirot opted not to investigate at the theater, instead choosing to secure seats for the variety show that night. The performance turned out to be dreadfully tedious, leaving me to wonder if it was truly the show or simply my own dismal state of mind.""",1
"""Now, my dear Suzanne, we must act quickly and decisively. Pagett will remain here, which means you have the perfect opportunity to join us in Rhodesia,"" I said, gripping Suzanne's hand tightly. ""If you were there when he arrived, everything would fall into place naturally. And let's not forget about Colonel Race and Sir Eustace entirely."" Suzanne dimpled and replied, ""Surely you can't suspect them?"" ""I suspect everyone,"" I said mysteriously. ""In detective stories, the most unlikely person is often the culprit. Cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace have been known to be criminals."" Suzanne agreed to keep an eye on Sir Eustace and promised to send a telegram if he showed any suspicious changes.",1
"""Japp always had a way of surprising me with his antics, prompting a chuckle from deep within. Meanwhile, Poirot remained composed as he sifted through his mail. A request to speak at the local boy scouts event, a visit from the Countess of Forfanock - most likely about her pampered lap-dog. But then, a shift in Poirot's demeanor caught my attention. With a sense of urgency, he passed me a particular sheet of paper. 'This is quite unusual,' he remarked. Taking the paper, I began to read.""",1
"""You are a woman."" ""Your perception of a woman is outdated. But you promised to show me around, right? It could be beneficial to me."" ""How so?"" ""Reporters are being kept out.

The faint murmur of voices came from within. ""Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise."" ""No,"" I said quickly, ""I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations."" ""But certainly, monsieur."" He produced it. ""Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all."" ""Of course."" I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that Marchaud saw me as important as Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She was delighted to see the key in my hand. ""You’ve got it then?"" ""Of course,"" I replied calmly. ""All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular."" ""You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?"" ""Wait a minute."" I stopped her eager advance. ""I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant."" She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. ""Me for the horrors,"" she said. ""Come along."" In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. ""You see,"" I said, ""he was stabbed in the back."" Her voice was almost soundless. ""With what?"" I nodded towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. ""You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you."" ""Water,"" she murmured. ""Quick. Water.…"" I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. ""Take me out of here oh, quickly, quickly!"" she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. ""That’s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?"" I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile. Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. ""I did my best to stop you, you know,"" I said gently. ""I suppose you did. Well, good-bye."" ""Look here, you can’t start off like that all alone. You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville."" ""Nonsense. I’m quite all right now."" ""Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you."" But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. ""Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me."" ""Are you sure you’re all right now?"" ""Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?"" I disclaimed the idea lightly. ""Well, good-bye."" ""Au revoir,"" I corrected. ""If you’re staying here, we shall meet again."" She flashed a smile at me. ""That’s so. Au revoir, then."" ""Wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?"" ""Oh, I’m staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It’s a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow."" ""I will,"" I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary empressement. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed. Fortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the sergent de ville. And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key kept? Parbleu, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of value to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of assassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse’s time. M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man withdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. ""Pardon M. Hautet,"" I cried, ""but will you permit me to ask him one question?"" ""But certainly, monsieur."" Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. ""Where do you keep your boots?"" ""Sac à papier!"" growled the old man. ""On my feet. Where else?"" ""But when you go to bed at night?"" ""Under my bed."" ""But who cleans them?"" ""Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise!"" he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. ""Well, well,"" said the magistrate. ""We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and "" ""You will not have to send far, M. le juge."" The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window. He leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table. ""Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner."" ""Not at all. Not at all,"" said the magistrate, rather confused. ""Of course I am only a detective,"" continued the other. ""I know nothing of interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do so without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.… But no matter."" M. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously, the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offence. ""Eh bien, M. Giraud,"" said the magistrate rather sharply. ""Without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names of the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where they find themselves now?"" Unmoved by this irony, Giraud replied: ""I know at least where they have come from."" ""Comment?"" Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. ""What do you see there?"" he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. ""A cigarette end, and a match."" ""And what does that tell you?"" Poirot spread out his hands. ""It tells me nothing."" ""Ah!"" said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. ""You haven’t made a study of these things. That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so."" ""And the other match?"" asked Poirot. ""Which match?"" ""The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?"" ""No."" ""Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly."" ""Not search thoroughly "" For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. ""I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper."" Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: ""The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America."" ""No,"" replied the other confidently. ""I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different."" ""You do not think it odd,"" asked Poirot, ""that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?"" Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. ""Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable."" ""Aha!"" said M. Hautet. ""An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!"" ""Or outside it,"" said Giraud with a peculiar smile. ""But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?"" ""D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key."" ""But who did possess a key?"" Giraud shrugged his shoulders. ""As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping."" ""Who is that?"" ""Madame Daubreuil,"" said the detective dryly. ""Eh, eh!"" said the magistrate, his face falling a little, ""so you have heard about that, have you?"" ""I hear everything,"" said Giraud imperturbably. ""There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,"" said M. Hautet, delighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado, he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He also touched on the cheque made out to ""Duveen,"" and finally handed Giraud the letter signed ""Bella."" Giraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then handed it back. ""All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected."" ""And your theory is?"" ""For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations."" ""Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,"" said Poirot suddenly. ""Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once."" ""Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you."" Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: ""I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain."" We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment.""",1
"""Oh, Minks had one of his best performances disguised as Miss Pettigrew, and he does a rather impressive imitation of my voice.” “I have a question.” “Go ahead.” “How did you convince Pagett to hire her?” “Well, it was quite easy.

Pagett believed her without a second thought.” “You're very open,” I remarked, observing him closely. “There's no reason for me not to be.” The reassurance didn't sit right with me.",1
"Miss Marvell leaned forward, revealing a stone of white fire in her palm. Poirot examined it closely and advised her to leave it with him. She mentioned a deal with Lord Yardly to film a play at Yardly Chase. Lady Yardly arrived, revealing that she also received blackmailing letters about the diamond. Poirot decided to involve himself in the case and questioned Lord Yardly about his plans to sell the Star of the East. Lord Yardly explained his financial difficulties and the pressure to sell the jewel, despite Lady Yardly's opposition.",1
"I grinned. Everyone made jokes about that giraffe. “Giraffes too. They were wanderers, you see. It wasn’t until they settled in communities, with women doing one thing and men another, that women became weak. And deep down, we’re all the same, we feel the same, I mean. That's why women admire physical strength in men - it's what they used to have and have since lost.” “Almost like ancestor worship, isn’t it?” “Something along those lines.” “Do you really believe that? That women worship strength?” “I think it’s quite true if we’re honest. You might think you value moral qualities, but when you fall in love, it all comes back to the physical. But I don’t think that’s the end of it. If we still lived in primitive conditions, it might be fine. But we don’t, and in the end, other things prevail. The things that seem defeated are the ones that always win, don’t they? They win in the way that truly matters. It’s like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” Colonel Race pondered, “you fall in love, and then you fall out of it. Is that what you’re getting at?” “Not quite, but you could put it that way if you want.” “But have you ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I confessed honestly. “Or fallen in love, for that matter?” I stayed silent. The car stopped at our destination, bringing our conversation to an end. We stepped out and began the leisurely climb up to the World’s View. Once again, I felt a slight unease in Colonel Race’s presence. He concealed his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He unsettled me somewhat. He always had. I never knew where I stood with him. We ascended in silence until we arrived at the place where Rhodes lies surrounded by enormous rocks. A strange, eerie place, far from civilization, singing a continuous hymn of rugged beauty. We sat there in silence for a while. Then we descended once more, deviating slightly from the path. At times, it was a challenging climb, and once we encountered a steep slope or rock that was nearly vertical. Colonel Race went first, then turned to assist me. “I should carry you,” he suddenly said, lifting me off the ground with a swift movement. I felt his strength as he placed me down and let go of me. A man of iron, with muscles like tightly wound steel springs. Once more, I felt a sense of fear, especially since he did not step away but stood directly in front of me, peering into my eyes. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he asked abruptly. “I’m a wanderer exploring the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. Pretending to be a newspaper correspondent is just a cover. You're not cut out for journalism. You're seizing life for yourself. But that’s not all.” What was he trying to make me reveal? I was scared. I met his gaze directly. My eyes may not keep secrets like his, but they can fight back. “What brings you here, Colonel Race?” I inquired deliberately. For a moment, I thought he wouldn’t answer. He seemed taken aback, though. Finally, he spoke, a hint of dark amusement in his words. “Chasing ambition,” he replied. “Just that, chasing ambition. You'll recall, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ and so on.” “They say,” I said slowly, “that you have ties to the Government, that you work in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my imagination, or did he pause for a split second before responding? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am simply a private individual traveling here for my own enjoyment.” Reflecting on his answer later, I found it slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he intended it to be so. We returned to the car in silence. Halfway back to Bulawayo, we stopped for tea at a rather basic structure on the side of the road. The owner was working in the garden and seemed irritated at being interrupted. However, he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an excruciating wait, he brought us some stale cakes and lukewarm tea. Then he went back to his garden. As soon as he left, we were surrounded by cats. Six of them, all meowing pitifully at once. The noise was deafening. I offered them bits of cake. They devoured them eagerly. I poured all the milk into a saucer, and they fought to lap it up. “Oh,” I exclaimed indignantly, “they’re starving! It’s cruel. Please, please, order more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race silently went to fulfill my request. The cats had started meowing again. He returned with a large jug of milk, and the cats lapped it all up. I stood up, determination in my eyes. “I’m taking these cats with us. I can’t leave them here.” “My dear girl, that’s absurd. You can’t manage six cats along with fifty wooden animals.” “Forget the wooden animals. These cats are living creatures. I’m bringing them back with us.” “You will do no such thing.” I glared at him, but he continued, “You might think me heartless, but one can’t go through life being sentimental about these things. It’s no use resisting. I won’t let you take them. This is a primitive land, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I’ve been defeated. I walked back to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably just short of food today,” he reassured me. “That man’s wife has gone to Bulawayo for supplies. So everything will be fine. And besides, you know, there are starving cats all over the world.” “Don’t don’t,” I said firmly. “I’m teaching you to see life as it truly is. I’m teaching you to be tough and ruthless like me. That’s the key to strength and success.”",1

She seemed to know exactly what she wanted and how to get it, a rare quality indeed.

"""I suspect that room is where we will discover Jack Renauld,"" I whispered to Poirot. Madame Daubreuil welcomed us in, mentioning that Jack's condition had not changed much, but she thought we might want to check on him ourselves. Up the stairs we went, entering the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil sat at a table, engrossed in her embroidery under the glow of a lamp. She gestured for silence as we approached. Jack Renauld lay in a restless slumber, his head tossing back and forth, his complexion still unusually red. ""Will the doctor return soon?"" Poirot inquired softly. ""Only if we request it. For now, let him rest,"" Madame Daubreuil replied.",1

"He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of anthropology. “Dolichocephalic,” I said lightly. Suzanne looked doubtful. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,” I explained fluently. There was a pause. I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean the opposite?” “Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.” “Brachycephalic,” I murmured unwillingly. “That’s it. I thought that was what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said with all the assurance I could muster. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she laughed. “You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.” “There’s nothing to tell,” I said unwillingly. “Isn’t there?” said Suzanne gently. “I suppose I shall have to tell you,” I said slowly. “I’m not ashamed of it. You can’t be ashamed of something that just happens to you. That’s what he did. He was detestable rude and ungrateful but that I think I understand. It’s like a dog that’s been chained up or badly treated it’ll bite anybody. That’s what he was like bitter and snarling. I don’t know why I care but I do. I care horribly. Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down. I love him. I want him. I’ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I find him, and I’ll make him care for me. I’d die for him. I’d work for him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him! There now you know!” Suzanne looked at me for a long time. “You’re very un-English, Gipsy girl,” she said at last. “There’s not a scrap of the sentimental about you. I’ve never met any one who was at once so practical and so passionate. I shall never care for any one like that mercifully for me and yet and yet I envy you, Gipsy girl. It’s something to be able to care. Most people can’t. But what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn’t marry him. He doesn’t sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy keeping high explosive in the house! So there’s to be no cabling to Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “And yet you believe him to be innocent?” “I also believe that innocent people can be hanged.” “Hm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In spite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.” “No,” I said. “He didn’t.” “That’s sentiment.” “No, it isn’t. He might have killed her. He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!” I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head. “Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress. “That was a very interesting story you told us last night,” I said, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always interested in diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.” “And what happened to him eventually, I mean. Does any one know?” Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions. Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed.” That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I got it all out of him, little by little. On the voyage from Cape Town to England one of the passengers had handed him a roll of films with instructions that they were to be dropped onto the bunk in Cabin 71 at 1 a.m. on January 22nd on the outward journey. A lady would be occupying the cabin, and the affair was described as a bet. I gathered that the steward had been liberally paid for his part in the transaction. The lady’s name had not been mentioned. Of course, as Mrs. Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing the purser as soon as she got on board, it never occurred to the steward that she was not the lady in question. The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the Kilmorden seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr. Pagett from their position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind. I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary. I was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. “I have always longed to go to Italy,” I said. “And especially to Florence. Didn’t you enjoy it very much there?” “Indeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld. If you will excuse me, there is some correspondence of Sir Eustace’s that” I took hold of him firmly by his coat sleeve. “Oh, you mustn’t run away!” I cried with the skittish accent of an elderly dowager. “I’m sure Sir Eustace wouldn’t like you to leave me alone with no one to talk to. You never seem to want to talk about Florence. Oh, Mr. Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!” I still had my hand on his arm, and I could feel the sudden start he gave. “Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables” “Oh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed. “Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters and er guides.” “Exactly,” I hastened to reply. “And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er the Madonna er Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So picturesque on the banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered. The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken since you were in Florence at the time. And yet” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where er where” “ did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow. You know Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a house there!” But with an incoherent muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled. That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett. No, Anne, don’t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down here. Joking apart, I think you’ve made a very important discovery. Up till now, we’ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we know he hasn’t.” “Exactly,” I said. “We must keep an eye on him.” “As well as everybody else,” she said ruefully. “Well, that’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. That and finance. No, don’t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you’ve got to listen to horse sense over this. We’re partners I wouldn’t offer you a penny because I liked you, or because you’re a friendless girl what I want is a thrill, and I’m prepared to pay for it. We’re going into this together regardless of expense. To begin with you’ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we’ll plan out our campaign.” We argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn’t like it. I wanted to do the thing on my own. “That’s settled,” said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching herself with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted with my own eloquence. Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.” “Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted. It was after midnight. I leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam. Ahead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark water. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange peace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream. And suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger. I had heard nothing, but I swung round instinctively. A shadowy form had crept up behind me. As I turned, it sprang. One hand gripped my throat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately, but I had no chance. I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling. My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship. There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending over him. “Did you hit him again?” I called breathlessly. “There was no need,” he replied grimly. “I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands. Rayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation. The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr.”",1

"""You never encountered a woman like her before! She must be at least forty, with pince-nez perched on her nose, sensible boots, and an air of brisk efficiency that could be the end of me. A woman with a face as expressionless as a slab of marble."" ""Do you think she will cling to your arm?"" ""I sincerely hope not!"" Sir Eustace exclaimed. ""That would be unbearable. Farewell, enchanting eyes. If I happen to shoot a lion, I will not be giving you its skin after how you have abandoned me."" He gave my hand a firm squeeze and we went our separate ways. Suzanne was already waiting for me in the entrance hall. She had come to see me off. ""Let's not waste any time,"" I hurriedly suggested, signaling to the doorman to hail a taxi.",1
"I will reveal everything. A man in Italy had incriminating information and demanded a large sum of money for it. I traveled to England to settle the matter. Meeting the man, I paid him in Italian notes for the papers. He gave them to me and I never saw him again. When arrested, I denied any involvement. I believe someone impersonated me that evening. No money was found in the flat. Poirot seemed puzzled, mentioning the window-curtains and coffee stains. He deduced that Graves orchestrated the whole scene, even staging a fake dinner party. Poirot's deduction impressed me, as always. Miss Violet Marsh visited Poirot with a unique request, detailing her family history from Devonshire.",1
"I always associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong, that is a lava-lava.

Suzanne seemed calmer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a beautiful view over Table Bay. I gazed at the view while Suzanne searched for some special face cream. Once she found it and began applying it, she was able to listen to me.",1
"""He smiled softly. ""I did not drink it,"" he said. While his friend Hastings rambled on, he seized the chance to pour the liquid into a small vial instead of swallowing it. That vial was on its way to the chemist for analysis. The doctor attempted to grab it, but he quickly realized that force would not work. In the short time that Hastings left to get the doctor, he had hidden the vial. ""Quick, Hastings, stop him!"" I mistakenly thought Poirot was worried about his friend and jumped in front of him. But the doctor's sudden action had a different purpose.""",1
"One does not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about her, you comprehend.” I nodded, my interest growing. “And the daughter?” I ventured. “A truly beautiful young girl modest, devout, all that she should be. One pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who wants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and then ” The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically. “But it would not be her fault!” I cried, with rising indignation. “No. But what will you? A man is particular about his wife’s antecedents.” I was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door. M. Hautet rang the bell. A few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a footfall within, and the door was opened. On the threshold stood my young goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her cheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with apprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid! “Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, “we regret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law you comprehend? My compliments to Madame your mother, and will she have the goodness to grant me a few moments’ interview.” For a moment the girl stood motionless. Her left hand was pressed to her side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her heart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice: “I will go and see. Please come inside.” She entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur of her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said: “But certainly. Ask them to enter.” In another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil. She was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat. “I am investigating the death of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?” She bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can er throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned to her. “Marthe, dear ” But the girl shook her head. “No, maman, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate. “You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder ” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you?” “Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?” “Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.” “Ah!” she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult me! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness to leave my house!” The honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought. Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand. “There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A few hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your investigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?” “Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.” With mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards Merlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Geneviève. “The French police system is very marvellous,” said Poirot, looking after them. “The information they possess about every one’s life, down to the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only been here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted with M..",1
"""I heard Colonel Race is heading to Rhodesia as well,” Suzanne remarked, deep in thought. “If we could somehow get Sir Eustace to extend an invitation to him too.” “You can make it happen. You have a way with things,” I replied. “I adore butter,” Suzanne purred with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. We concluded our conversation with the understanding that Suzanne would utilize her skills to their fullest potential. Feeling too restless to retire for the night, I made my way up to the deck. Tomorrow morning, we would reach Table Bay. The breeze was invigorating, the boat gently swaying in the choppy waters. The deck was shrouded in darkness, devoid of any souls.",1
"""Poirot,"" I said, ""a change of air would do you good.""""You think so, mon ami?""""I am sure of it.""""Eh eh?"" said my friend, smiling. ""It is all arranged, then?""""You will come?""""Where do you propose to take me?""""Brighton. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put me on to a very good thing, and well, I have money to burn, as the saying goes. I think a week-end at the Grand Metropolitan would do us all the good in the world.""""Thank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.""I did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities. But his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance aside. ""Then, that's all right,"" I said hastily. Saturday evening saw us dining at the Grand Metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at Brighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste were something magnificent. ""Hein, it is a sight this!"" murmured Poirot. ""This is the home of the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?"" ""Supposed to be,"" I replied. ""But we'll hope they aren't all tarred with the Profiteering brush."" Poirot gazed round him placidly. ""The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains to crime, instead of to its detection. What a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction! Regard, Hastings, that stout woman by the pillar. She is, as you would say, plastered with gems."" I followed his eyes. ""Why,"" I exclaimed, ""it's Mrs. Opalsen."" ""You know her?""""Slightly. Her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in the recent Oil boom."" After dinner we ran across the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended by having our coffee together. Poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the lady's ample bosom, and she brightened up at once. ""It's a perfect hobby of mine, Mr. Poirot. I just love jewellery. Ed knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me something new. You are interested in precious stones?"" ""I have had a good deal to do with them one time and another, madame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world."" He went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with bated breath. ""There now!"" she exclaimed, as he ended. ""If it isn't just like a play! You know, I've got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them. I believe it's supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!"" ""Oh, madame,"" protested Poirot, ""you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!"" ""Oh, but I'd like to show it to you."" The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly. ""Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,"" explained the latter. ""Oh, the pearls!"" Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. ""Well, they are worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the money's there all right; I could get what I paid for them any day perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are now.""",1
"""Suzanne carefully carved out a space, concealed the diamonds using cotton wool to muffle any noise, and sealed it back up.” Sir Eustace stared at me intently. His response was typical: “I've always despised that cursed giraffe,” he muttered. “It must have been an instinctual feeling.” We were stranded that evening, unable to make our way back to Johannesburg due to the relentless shelling. It seemed we were trapped, as the rebels had taken control of a new section of the city. Our sanctuary was a remote farm about twenty miles from Johannesburg, situated in the open veld. Exhaustion weighed heavily on me.""",1
"""But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.” “That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least ” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M. le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “Eh bien! I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M. Hautet addressed us: “Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.""",1
"""To see those two brought to justice, that is a different story. Japp will do his best, but I fear we may have to leave it to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer."" ""The wicked may prosper for a time,"" I replied. ""But there is always a cost, mon ami."" Poirot's fears were realized. Despite Japp's confidence in his theory, he couldn't gather enough evidence for a conviction. Mr. Pace's substantial fortune fell into the hands of his killers.""",1
"""His face, once flushed with shock, turned deathly pale. 'An aeroplane wire paper cutter? That's what killed my father?' 'Yes, it seems so,' replied the detective. 'Sharp and easy to handle.' The tool had been removed from the body, but M. Renauld requested to see it. The commissary was sent to retrieve it. Meanwhile, Poirot noticed a pair of candlesticks out of place. Suddenly, the commissary burst in, alarmed. 'The dagger is gone!' 'Gone?' exclaimed the magistrate. 'Vanished. The glass jar is empty!' Everyone turned to the witness, who admitted to visiting the shed that morning with a young English lady. The magistrate scolded him for the irregularity, but softened at the mention of youth and beauty.""",1
"He appeared to be in his forties, with a hint of silver hair framing his temples, and undoubtedly the most handsome passenger on the ship. I inquired with the stewardess about the identity of the captivating lady beside me. ""That is the Honorable Mrs. Clarence Blair, a prominent figure in high society. Surely you have heard of her in the newspapers."" I acknowledged, studying her with a newfound curiosity. Mrs. Blair was renowned as one of the most fashionable women of her time. I couldn't help but notice that she was commanding a considerable amount of admiration.",1
"Madame Daubreuil and her daughter were an intriguing pair. The daughter, innocent and pure, caught in the web of her mother's secrets. Madame Daubreuil, charming and enigmatic, with a past shrouded in mystery. As the examining magistrate probed for answers, the tension in the room grew palpable. The daughter's loyalty to her mother unwavering, while Madame Daubreuil's composure never faltered. The air was thick with unspoken truths and hidden motives. It was clear that beneath their facade of civility, lurked a darkness waiting to be revealed.",1
"""I like a good cat and dog life."" ""It's always a fight between lovers,"" I reassured him. ""They just don't get each other. And by the time they do, the love's gone."" ""So, do people who fight always love each other?"" ""I'm not sure,"" I said, feeling a bit lost. He walked over to the fireplace. ""Want more soup?"" he asked casually. ""Yes, please. I'm starving,"" I replied. ""I could eat a hippopotamus."" ""Great,"" he said, tending to the fire. ""Once I can get off this couch, I'll cook for you,"" I promised. ""You don't know how to cook,"" he teased. ""I can manage tins just fine,"" I retorted, pointing to a row on the mantelpiece. ""Touché,"" he laughed. His whole demeanor changed when he laughed. It was a different side to him. I enjoyed the soup. As I ate, I reminded him that he hadn't given me his advice. ""Oh, yes. Here it is. Stay hidden until you're fully recovered. Your enemies will think you're dead. They won't be surprised by the absence of a body. It would've been washed away in the river."" I shivered. ""Once you're well, head to Beira and get back to England."" ""That sounds boring,"" I scoffed. ""You sound like a silly schoolgirl."" ""I'm not a schoolgirl,"" I protested. ""I'm a woman."" He looked at me with an unreadable expression as I sat up excited. ""God help me, you are,"" he muttered, then left abruptly. My recovery was quick. I had a head injury and a bad arm. At first, he thought it was broken, but it wasn't. Despite the pain, I was regaining mobility. It was a strange time. We were isolated, alone like Adam and Eve, but different. Old Batani was like a shadow. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much as I could with one arm. Harry was often out, but we spent hours together under the palms, talking, arguing, and bonding. We argued a lot, but a true friendship blossomed, surprising us both. And something more. The time was approaching when I'd have to leave, and it weighed heavily on me. Would he let me go without a word? Without a sign? He had his silent moments, his moody spells, his walks alone. One evening, it all came to a head. We had finished eating and were by the hut's entrance as the sun set. Harry hadn't been able to provide me with hairpins, so my hair, long and dark, hung loose. Lost in thought, I felt his eyes on me. ""You look like a witch, Anne,"" he said, with a new tone in his voice. He reached out and touched my hair. I shuddered. Suddenly, he stood up, swearing. ""You have to leave tomorrow, you hear me?"" he exclaimed. ""I can't take it anymore. I'm only human. You have to go, Anne. You have to. You're not foolish. You know this can't continue."" ""I suppose not,"" I said slowly. ""But it's been good, hasn't it?"" ""Good? It's been hell!"" ""That bad?"" ""Why do you torment me? Why mock me? Why laugh into your hair like that?"" ""I wasn't laughing. I'm not mocking. If you want me to go, I'll go. If you want me to stay, I'll stay."" ""Not that!"" he cried out. ""Don't tempt me, Anne. Do you know what I am? A criminal, hunted. They know me as Harry Parker here, but they might figure it out any day. You're so young, so beautiful. Your life is ahead of you. Mine is behind me, scorched, ruined. If you don't want me—"" ""You know I do. I'd give anything to hold you here, hidden from the world, forever. But you're tempting me. You, with your long hair and laughing eyes. But I'll save you from us. You'll go tonight. You'll go to Beira."" ""I'm not going to Beira,"" I interrupted. ""You are. I'll take you there myself if I have to. I can't keep living in fear.

"“Not the venom of the Borgias,” Poirot responded, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Your mind is racing. I would suggest it was French chalk.” “French chalk?” “Yes, cabinet-makers use it for smooth drawers.” I chuckled. “You mischievous one! I thought you were building up to something thrilling.” “Goodbye, my friend. I retreat. I vanish!” He exited, the door closing behind him. With a half mocking, half fond smile, I picked up the coat and reached for the clothes-brush. The following day, without any word from Poirot, I went for a leisurely walk, ran into some old acquaintances, and had lunch with them at their hotel.",1
"""As far as I know, Sir Eustace, he believes so and he must have the knowledge to confirm that."" ""By the way, where is he?"" I questioned. ""I haven't seen him since we got on board."" ""He claims to be unwell, and remains in his cabin, Sir Eustace."" Pagett's voice lowered once more. ""But I'm certain that's a cover. So he can observe better."" ""Observe?"" ""For your protection, Sir Eustace. In case there's an attempt on your life."" ""You're such a ray of sunshine, Pagett,"" I remarked. ""I hope your mind doesn't run wild. If I were you, I'd attend the party dressed as a grim reaper or a hangman. It matches your gloomy appearance."" That silenced him temporarily. I headed to the upper deck.""",1

They belong to Mrs. Blair."" Pagett's expression fell. He despised making errors. ""Just repack them neatly,"" I instructed. ""Then take a stroll outside. Jo'burg might be a pile of rubble tomorrow, so enjoy it while you can."" I hoped that would keep him occupied for the morning, at least. ""There's something I need to discuss with you when you have time, Sir Eustace."" ""I'm busy at the moment,"" I interjected quickly.",1
"“Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.” “I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.” “You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?” “No, doctor, I’m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you’ll see, something will turn up! You’ll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.” My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa’s London solicitor. He came down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it.",1
"""Did you forget about the letter?” “No, I didn't forget. But why do you believe that letter was intended for M. Renauld?” “Well, it was discovered in his pocket and...” “That's it!” interrupted Poirot. “There was no indication of a recipient's name on the letter. We assumed it was for the deceased because it was in his overcoat pocket. But, my friend, something about that overcoat seemed odd to me. I measured it and commented on how long it was. That should have sparked some thoughts in your mind.” “I thought you were simply making an observation for the sake of it,” I admitted.",1
"“Then, naturally, we must ascertain our current situation. What was the time of Mr. Schneider’s passing?” “Three days prior.” “You are certain it was tetanus?” “Absolutely certain.” “There is no possibility of it being strychnine poisoning, correct?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I understand your concern. But it was undoubtedly tetanus.” “Were anti-serums administered?” “Indeed they were,” the doctor replied curtly. “We exhausted all possible measures.” “Did you have the anti-serum on hand?” “No. We obtained it from Cairo.",1
"“I couldn’t sleep. I was restless, disturbed, had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream,” he explained. “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I inquired. He looked embarrassed. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death,” he responded with a tinge of bitterness.",1
"“May I inquire as to your identity?” Poirot asked, taking a step closer and nodding respectfully. “I do hope that your husband won’t catch a cold. I couldn’t help but notice that he was wearing slippers and a rather warm dressing-gown.” “Who are you and what do you want?” demanded the woman, her voice filled with suspicion. “It is unfortunate that we have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, madame,” Poirot replied apologetically. “Especially considering that one of our party has traveled all the way from New York just to see you.” Suddenly, the curtains were drawn back and the figure of the Italian man emerged. To my dismay, I saw that he was holding my gun, which Poirot must have accidentally left behind in the taxi.",1
"On the ground was a body covered by a dark cloth, concealing the face. ""Dead?"" I asked. She confirmed. ""I believe so."" ""Perhaps they hit their head on the marble fender."" ""But who is it?"" I inquired. ""The killer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the attempted killer of Madame Renauld."" Perplexed, I knelt down and uncovered the face, revealing the lifeless and stunning features of Marthe Daubreuil. My mind was a jumble of memories from that fateful night. Poirot remained silent to my inquiries.",1
"Having expressed my gratitude to Hassan and declining his offer of more coffee, we found ourselves alone once again. I lingered by the entrance of the tent, gazing out at the vast expanse of the desert after removing my clothes. ""This is truly a remarkable place,"" I remarked aloud, ""and an extraordinary undertaking. I sense the allure of it all. The existence in the desert, the exploration of a bygone civilization. Surely, Poirot, you also perceive the magic?"" Silence greeted my question, prompting me to turn around, feeling a twinge of irritation. But that irritation swiftly transformed into alarm. Poirot was sprawled on the makeshift bed, his face contorted in agony.",1
"""Blair, my dear lady, I must say, your observation about Mr. Pagett is quite intriguing,"" remarked Sir Eustace, with a hint of amusement in his voice. ""Indeed, his face does not inspire confidence in his innocence, does it?"" Mrs. Blair gave a knowing nod, and Colonel Race chimed in, ""Six years is quite a long time to have someone so invaluable in your service, Sir Eustace."" The conversation flowed effortlessly, with mentions of dancing, ghosts in cabin 17, and the mysterious Mr. Chichester. As the evening progressed, secrets and suspicions lingered in the air, leaving Sir Eustace pondering the true intentions of those around him.",1
"""Anne, do you recall telling me that women often do things they dislike for someone they care about?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, curious about his intentions. He embraced me tightly. ""Anne, run away with me tonight. Let's go back to Rhodesia, back to the island. I can't endure all this foolishness any longer. I can't keep waiting for you."" I pulled away for a moment. ""And what about my collection of French dresses?"" I lamented in a playful tone. Harry still struggles to differentiate when I am serious and when I am simply teasing him. ""Forget your French dresses.",1
"As I glanced at him, a sense of deja vu washed over me. His face triggered a memory, but I dismissed it quickly. Glancing down at my watch, I realized time was slipping away. With a swift turn, I headed towards Cape Town. Spotting a tram about to depart, I sprinted to catch it. Footsteps echoed behind me, growing louder. I leaped onto the tram, closely followed by the other runner. It was him - the man from the night before, the one with the distinctive nose. The pieces fell into place - the encounter at the station, the untied shoe on the road. The puzzle was coming together in a rather unexpected way.",1
"""They're always so helpful, even if it can be a bit overwhelming at times. You ask them for directions and instead of a simple 'turn right, then left,' they go on and on with well-intentioned instructions. And if you still look lost, they'll kindly take you by the arm and personally guide you all the way there."" ""Have you had a similar experience in Venice, Pagett?"" inquired Sir Eustace, flashing a smile at his secretary. The question appeared to unsettle Mr. Pagett for some reason. He stuttered and blushed. ""Oh, yes, quite so, er, quite so."" With a mumbled apology, he stood up and abruptly exited the room.",1
"The passage was dark and eerie, with only a faint light illuminating the room. Mrs. Maltravers let out a blood-curdling scream as she turned to Poirot. ""You saw him there in the passage?"" she cried out, her voice filled with terror. Poirot looked puzzled, shaking his head. ""Madame, I saw nothing. You must be imagining things."" But Mrs. Maltravers insisted, her voice growing more frantic. Suddenly, the lights flickered and went out, plunging the room into darkness. Three loud raps echoed through the room, causing Mrs. Maltravers to moan in fear. And then, as if materializing out of thin air, the figure of a man appeared before them, glowing with an unearthly light.",1
"""All women do."" ""Will they be practicing low jumps?"" I inquired, chuckling. ""No, I'm afraid not. I need to head to Durban."" Sir Eustace glanced at me, let out a heavy sigh, then opened the door to the next room and called for Pagett. ""If you're done with your nap, my friend, how about working for a change?"" Guy Pagett entered the room. He nodded to both of us, looking surprised at the sight of me, and responded in a somber tone: ""I've been typing that memo all afternoon, Sir Eustace."" ""Then stop typing it.""",1
"We boarded the boat, the wind howling around us. Poirot clutched my arm, his face a mask of terror. ""Mon Dieu!"" he whispered. ""This is unbearable!""""Stay strong, Poirot,"" I urged. ""You will prevail. I believe in you.""He shook his head. ""Ah, my friend, you misunderstand. It is not fear that grips me, but seasickness! It is a dreadful affliction.""As the boat lurched forward, Poirot groaned and shut his eyes. ""Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you wish to examine it?"" I offered.Poirot waved me away. ""No, no! Allow me some peace. The key is to align the stomach and the mind. Laverguier has a technique that can alleviate seasickness. You breathe in and out slowly, turning your head from side to side and counting to six between each breath.""I left him to his breathing exercises and went up on deck. When we arrived in Boulogne Harbour, Poirot joined me, looking composed and cheerful. He whispered to me that Laverguier's method had worked ""marvelously!""Japp was still studying his map, tracing imaginary paths with his finger. ""Rubbish! The car departed from Boulogne and then changed course. I suspect they switched the Prime Minister to another vehicle. Don't you see?""The tall detective disagreed. ""I plan to focus on the ports. Chances are, they've smuggled him onto a ship.""Japp shook his head. ""Too obvious. All the ports were immediately closed off.""As dawn broke, we disembarked. Major Norman informed Poirot that a military car was waiting for him. ""Thank you, but I have no intention of leaving Boulogne at the moment,"" Poirot replied.""What? Why not?""""No, we will enter this hotel by the quay,"" he said decisively.Confused, we followed him to a private room in the hotel. Poirot turned to us, challenging our expectations of a detective. ""The true clues are within here,"" he tapped his forehead. ""I could have solved this case from London. The key is to use the little grey cells. Method and logic are all that is needed.""For hours, Poirot sat in silence, his eyes flickering like a cat's. The Scotland Yard man was disdainful, Major Norman was bored, and I grew increasingly restless.At last, Poirot sprang up, his demeanor transformed. ""Mes amis, let us begin!""I turned to him, astonished by his sudden energy. ""What have you discovered?""""I have been a fool, but now I see the light,"" Poirot declared.As we returned to England, Poirot explained his new plan. ""To work with method, we must start at the beginning. And the beginning of this case was in England. Therefore, we must go back.""Upon our arrival at Charing Cross platform, Poirot remained steadfast in his belief that starting over was the only way forward. With Norman's assistance, he swiftly sent out telegrams and we were escorted through London by plain-clothes officers.In a police car on the Bath Road, Poirot received a list of cottage hospitals near London. ""I had it sent from Dover,"" he informed me.The investigation continued, with Poirot leading the way with renewed purpose and determination.",1
"""A sudden feeling of doubt passed through my mind. Had I ever disclosed the location of the hotel to Poirot? Glancing at him, I found him engrossed in cutting his bread meticulously, seemingly convinced that I had revealed the information to him. We enjoyed our coffee by the sea. Poirot savored one of his slender cigarettes before checking the time on his watch. “The train to Paris departs at 2:25,” he remarked. “I should be on my way.” “Paris?” I exclaimed. “That is correct, my friend.” “You’re going to Paris? But why?” Poirot responded gravely, “To hunt down M. Renauld’s murderer.” “You suspect he’s in Paris?” “I am certain he is not. However, that is where I must search for him. You may not comprehend now, but all will be explained in due time. Trust me, this journey to Paris is crucial. I won’t be gone long. Most likely, I’ll return tomorrow. I don’t expect you to join me. Stay here, keep an eye on Giraud, get to know M. Renauld’s son, and if you wish, try your luck with Mademoiselle Marthe. But I doubt you’ll have much success.”I was taken aback by his final comment. “By the way,” I interjected. “How did you know about those two?”“My friend, I understand human nature. Pair a young lad like Renauld with a lovely girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and a romantic entanglement is nearly inevitable. And then the quarrel! It was either money or a woman, and after recalling Léonie’s description of the lad’s rage, I deduced it was the latter. So, I took a guess, and I was correct.”“That’s why you warned me not to fall for the lady? You suspected she had feelings for young Renauld?”Poirot grinned. “I had noticed the worry in her eyes. I always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes…” His tone was so serious that it unsettled me. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?”“I believe, my friend, that we will soon find out. But I must depart.”“You have plenty of time.”“Perhaps, perhaps. But I prefer to have ample time at the station. I do not like to rush or agitate myself.”“In any case,” I said, standing up. “I’ll walk you to the station.”“You will do no such thing. I forbid it.” His tone was so authoritative that I gaped at him in surprise. He nodded firmly. “I mean it, my friend. Goodbye! May I hug you? Ah, no, I forgot it’s not customary for the English. A handshake, then.”After Poirot left, I felt somewhat lost. I wandered along the beach, observing the swimmers, but lacking the energy to join them. I half-expected Cinderella to be among them in a magnificent outfit, but she was nowhere to be seen.""",1
"He could not force her hand, for she had the upper hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.” I was compelled, somewhat reluctantly, to acknowledge the veracity of this. “Your hypothesis,” I commented sharply, “is undoubtedly accurate in all respects?” “My hypothesis is the truth,” said Poirot calmly. “And the truth is inevitably accurate. In your hypothesis you made a fundamental mistake. You allowed your imagination to mislead you with late-night meetings and intense love scenes. But in investigating crime we must focus on the ordinary. Shall I illustrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us see a demonstration!” Poirot sat very straight and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to stress his points. “I will begin as you did from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the tale recounted by Madame Beroldy in court regarding the ‘Russians’ was clearly a fabrication. If she was innocent of involvement in the crime, it was devised by her, and by her alone as she claimed. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it could have been fabricated by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this situation we are examining, we encounter the same story. As I pointed out to you, the facts make it highly improbable that Madame Daubreuil originated it. So we consider the possibility that the story was concocted by Georges Conneau. Very well. Georges Conneau, therefore, orchestrated the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the spotlight, and behind her is a mysterious figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us meticulously review the Renauld Case from the beginning, noting each significant point in its chronological sequence. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to jot down?” “The letter to you?” “That was the initial piece of information we had, but it is not the true commencement of the case. The first noteworthy point, I would say, is the change that occurred in M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is corroborated by several witnesses. We also have to consider his relationship with Madame Daubreuil, and the substantial amounts of money transferred to her. From there we can move directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and gestured for me to write. “23rd May. M. Renauld argues with his son over latter’s desire to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son departs for Paris. “24th May. M. Renauld revises his will, leaving complete control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “7th June. Dispute with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter penned to M. Hercule Poirot, seeking assistance. “Telegram dispatched to Jack Renauld, instructing him to travel by the Anzora to Buenos Ayres. “Chauffeur, Masters, sent away on a vacation. “Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are ‘Yes, yes but for God’s sake go now.…’” Poirot paused. “There, Hastings, analyze each of those facts individually, consider them thoughtfully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do not gain new insight into the matter.” I endeavored conscientiously to do as he had suggested. After a moment or two, I said rather uncertainly: “As for the initial points, the issue appears to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.” “Blackmail, definitely. You heard what Stonor said about his character and habits.” “Mrs. Renauld did not corroborate his view,” I argued. “We have already seen that Madame Renauld’s testimony cannot be trusted in any way. We must rely on Stonor on that point.” “Still, if Renauld had a relationship with a woman named Bella, there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.” “None whatsoever, I concede, Hastings. But did he?” “The letter, Poirot. You forget the letter.” “No, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written to M. Renauld?” “Why it was found in his pocket and and ” “And that is all!” cut in Poirot. “There was no mention of any name to show to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead man because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, mon ami, something about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it, and made the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should have given you to think.” “I thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,” I confessed. “Ah, quelle idée! Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Eh bien, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris, and tell me what you make of it!” “I see,” I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot’s remarks bore in upon me. “That letter was written to Jack Renauld not to his father. He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.” Poirot nodded. “Précisement! We can return to this point later. For the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with M. Renauld père, and pass to the next chronological event.” “May 23rd,” I read, “M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don’t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.” “We agree, mon ami at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M. Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.",1
"""But the man posing as the Prime Minister was observed by all!""""He was not spotted by those who were close to him. Daniels made sure to keep him isolated.

"It became evident to me that establishing a certain reputation was necessary. Avoiding explanations indefinitely was not an option. The resolution to my problems was within reach, even if I did not realize it immediately. The Daily Budget! My words or my silence would no longer impact Harry Rayburn. He had been labeled as “The Man in the Brown Suit” without any involvement of mine. The best way to assist him was to appear to be against him. The “Colonel” and his associates could not suspect any friendly connection between me and the man they had chosen as the scapegoat for the Marlow murder. As far as I was aware, the identity of the deceased woman had not been determined. I intended to send a message to Lord Nasby, proposing that she might be none other than the renowned Russian dancer “Nadina” who had captivated audiences in Paris. It struck me as unbelievable that she had not been identified yet, but upon further investigation, I understood the reasons behind it. Nadina had never visited England during her successful career in Paris. She was unfamiliar to the audiences in London. The images of the Marlow victim in the newspapers were so indistinct and unrecognizable that it was not surprising no one had recognized her. Additionally, Nadina had kept her plans of visiting England a well-kept secret from everyone. A letter, supposedly from the dancer, had been received by her manager the day after the murder, stating that she was returning to Russia due to urgent personal matters, leaving him to handle her terminated contract. I learned all of this later on. With Suzanne’s endorsement, I sent a lengthy cable from De Aar. It reached its destination at a crucial moment (which, once again, I found out later). The Daily Budget was in need of a sensational story. My hypothesis was confirmed and proven accurate, resulting in the Daily Budget obtaining the exclusive story of a lifetime. “Identity of Victim in Mill House Murder Revealed by our correspondent.” And so forth. “Our correspondent accompanies the culprit. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ A closer look at his true nature.” The essential details were promptly sent to the South African newspapers, but I did not read my own extensive articles until much later! I received approval and detailed instructions via cable in Bulawayo. I was now part of the Daily Budget team, and I received a personal congratulations from Lord Nasby himself. I was officially tasked with tracking down the murderer, and I was the only one who knew it was not Harry Rayburn! However, it was better for the world to believe otherwise for the time being. We reached Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I found the place disappointing. The heat was unbearable, and I detested the hotel. Moreover, Sir Eustace was in a perpetually bad mood. I suspect it was the wooden animals that irritated him the most, particularly the enormous giraffe. The giraffe was immense, with a neck that seemed impossible, a gentle gaze, and a drooping tail. It possessed character. It had allure.",1
"Let's go to Marsdon Manor and investigate further,” Poirot suggested, leading the way out of the consulting room. Mrs. Maltravers, a young and beautiful widow, followed us silently. Her eyes were red from crying, but her beauty was undeniable. She explained that her husband had been out shooting rooks on the day of his death. Poirot examined the rook rifle that was left in the hall. We needed to uncover the truth behind Mr. Maltravers' sudden demise.",1
"""Lady Yardly,"" I said, ""I know the reason behind your visit. You have been targeted by blackmailers regarding the diamond."" My words hit their mark, evident from the shock on her face.

If Miss Marvell, with one of the twin diamonds, has received threatening letters,"" ""Miss Marvell? She was here?"" ""She just departed. So, if she's been warned, it follows that you, with the other diamond, would have also been a target.""",1

"Poirot carefully examined the dagger that had been removed from the wound, now resting in a glass jar beside the body. His eyes gleamed with excitement as he observed the lack of blood and stains on the clothes. ""This wound is strange,"" he remarked.

Undoubtedly, you are content with the role you are performing.""",1
"We had planned to attend the Sunday concert, followed by an afternoon out, and then a nap after a hearty dinner of England le rosbif. These activities were meant to divert attention from Hercule Poirot's investigations. As we entered the crude wooden contraption, I hesitated. ""Are we breaking into the flat?"" I inquired cautiously. Poirot's response did little to ease my concerns: ""Not today,"" he said cryptically. With a tug on the rope, we descended to the second floor.",1
"Renauld’s plans to mislead the authorities were deceptively simple, a hallmark of a master criminal. Madame Renauld seemed a likely suspect, given her close relationship with the victim, but evidence pointed away from her guilt. The only other person known to be privy to Renauld’s intentions was Marthe Daubreuil, who confessed to overhearing his altercation with the vagrant. This revelation raised new questions and suspicions in the investigation.",1
"""Exploring this unfamiliar world had a certain allure, especially when I witnessed her animated expression light up while she spoke. Our journey took us through Amiens, triggering a flood of memories. It seemed as though my companion could read my thoughts. “Reflecting on the War?” I nodded in response. “You served, I presume?” “Yes, I did. I got injured once, and after the Somme, I was discharged. I had a temporary role in the Army for a while. Now, I work as a private secretary for an M.P.” “Impressive!” “Not really. It’s quite mundane, to be honest. I usually wrap up my work in a couple of hours each day. It’s not very stimulating either.",1
"Poirot sat calmly reading his mail. Among the usual requests, a peculiar letter caught his attention. It was a plea for help from a man in France, fearing for his life. The urgency of the situation was evident in the hastily scrawled postscript, begging Poirot to come quickly. Intrigued by the mystery, Poirot wasted no time in making plans to travel to France to meet this desperate man in need of his detective skills. The clock was ticking, and there was no time to waste.",1
"""Pardon me, madame, but may I inquire about the nature of the business in Buenos Ayres?” Mrs. Renauld turned to face him, her expression guarded. “I am afraid I do not possess such knowledge, Monsieur Poirot. However, Buenos Ayres is merely a stepping stone for my son, his true destination being Santiago.” The mention of Santiago seemed to trigger a reaction in both the magistrate and the commissary, who simultaneously exclaimed, “Santiago! Once again, Santiago!” Poirot, who had been lost in thought near the window, approached Mrs. Renauld with a respectful nod, his mind seemingly elsewhere.",1
"""At that moment, the front door opened and M. Hautet and the commissary descended the steps. ""Ah, M. Poirot, we were just about to search for you,"" the magistrate stated. ""Although it is late, I feel compelled to visit Madame Daubreuil. Surely, she will be greatly distressed by M. Renauld's passing, and perhaps we can find a lead from her. The secret he kept from his wife may have been shared with the woman who captivated him. We are aware of our Samsons' vulnerabilities, aren't we?"" I found M. Hautet's choice of words quite striking.""",1
"Poirot and Giraud were in deep conversation, surrounded by a crowd of curious onlookers. Suddenly, Giraud produced a surprising piece of evidence - a woman's hair coiled around the handle of the dagger. Poirot's interest was piqued as he pondered over the mysterious discovery. ""A woman's hair? Whose could it be?"" he mused. As they left the shed, Giraud's suave voice echoed in Poirot's mind. ""What game is he playing?"" wondered Poirot, intrigued by the unexpected turn of events. Later, over a hearty lunch, Poirot remained lost in thought, his mind clearly preoccupied with unraveling the tangled web of clues before him.",1
"""And, in reality, he could very well be against him. To continue my assumptions. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had seen the paper he dropped. Thus, misguided by the dot as you were, he endeavors to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, after previously attempting to obtain the cabin through Pagett. On the journey there, someone stabs him"" “Who?” I interjected. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits together. Send a message to Lord Nasby claiming you have discovered ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune is assured, Anne!” “There are a number of things you have failed to consider.” “What things? Rayburn has a scar, I know but a scar can be easily faked. He is the correct height and build. What is the description of a head with which you impressed them at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be familiar with technical terms of anthropology. “Dolichocephalic,” I said casually. Suzanne looked uncertain. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,” I explained smoothly. There was a moment of silence. I was just starting to breathe normally when Suzanne suddenly asked: “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean the opposite?” “Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.” “Brachycephalic,” I muttered reluctantly. “That’s it. I thought that was what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said confidently. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she chuckled. “You lie very convincingly, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.” “There’s nothing to tell,” I said reluctantly. “Isn’t there?” said Suzanne gently. “I suppose I shall have to tell you,” I said slowly. “I’m not ashamed of it. You can’t be ashamed of something that just happens to you. That’s what he did. He was detestable rude and ungrateful, but that I think I understand. It’s like a dog that’s been chained up or badly treated; it’ll bite anybody. That’s what he was like, bitter and snarling. I don’t know why I care but I do. I care horribly. Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down. I love him. I want him. I’ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I find him, and I’ll make him care for me. I’d die for him. I’d work for him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him! There now you know!” Suzanne stared at me for a long time. “You’re very un-English, Gipsy girl,” she said finally. “There’s not a scrap of the sentimental about you. I’ve never met anyone who was so practical and so passionate at the same time. I shall never care for anyone like that, mercifully for me, and yet and yet I envy you, Gipsy girl. It’s something to be able to care. Most people can’t. But what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn’t marry him. He doesn’t sound at all like the kind of person who would enjoy keeping high explosive in the house! So there’s to be no sending a message to Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “And yet you believe him to be innocent?” “I also believe that innocent people can be hanged.” “Hm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In spite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.” “No,” I said. “He didn’t.” “That’s sentiment.” “No, it isn’t. He might have killed her. He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne shuddered. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!” I had an opportunity to approach Colonel Race the next morning. The sale of the sweep had just ended, and we strolled up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head. “Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leaned over the rail together. It was a glassy calm. The sea appeared as though it had been oiled. There were large patches of color on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple, and deep orange, like a cubist painting. There was an occasional glint of silver that indicated the presence of flying fish. The air was damp and warm, almost sticky. Its touch was like a fragrant caress. “That was a very intriguing tale you recounted last night,” I remarked, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always fascinated by diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what happened to the other young man? You mentioned there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he got off scot-free too.” “And what became of him in the end, I mean. Does anyone know?” Colonel Race was gazing straight ahead at the sea. His face was as expressionless as a mask, but I had a feeling that he did not appreciate my inquiries. Nevertheless, he answered readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed.” That provided me with the information I sought. I asked no more. But more than ever I pondered how much Colonel Race was aware of. One other thing I did. That was to speak with the night steward. With a bit of financial incentive, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed like a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I extracted all the details from him, bit by bit.""",1
"""Despite your insistence, I, Hercule Poirot, refuse to degrade myself by laying on the ground (perhaps on wet grass) to analyze imaginary footprints, or collecting cigarette ash without understanding the different types. Think back to the case of the Plymouth Express. Inspector Japp went off to inspect the railway tracks. Upon his return, I was able to accurately describe his findings without leaving my room.” “Are you suggesting that Japp's efforts were fruitless?” “On the contrary, his discoveries only served to support my deductions.""",1
"""They could hardly have been hidden on board and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the Olympia’s arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the Olympia got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.” “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?” “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.” “But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked Poirot gently. “Yes.” The young man stared at him in a puzzled manner. “You do not catch my meaning, I see,” said Poirot, smiling enigmatically. “Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank.” Ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it. “Send this in and my uncle will see you at once.” Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the London and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven. “I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr. Vavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.” “I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs’s?” “I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.” “And no clerk has had access to them?” Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago in fact on the very day that Philip left us. He has only just recovered.” “Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw ruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.” Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out. “I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street. “You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.” “It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, mon ami.",1
"""The films that disappeared through the vent on the 22nd, remember? How do you know they were the originals? Who would go through the trouble of returning them that way in the dead of night?

"But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of ‘the Western Star’ struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly prepares to range himself to settle down. And then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be discovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory Rolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising to arrange all and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have £50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs” “But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected. “I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!” “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity. “I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!” I pondered the matter. “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. Bonne mère, très femme!” “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.” “Pas du tout,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that you, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.” “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung. “Si, si, mon ami, it is a pity that you study not the psychology. She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!” “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!” “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.” “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.” “Mon Dieu! but how you enrage yourself for nothing, mon ami!” “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself! I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise. “A la bonne heure, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.” “You are called away on a case, then?” “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.” “Yes?” I said, much interested. “There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last the day before yesterday the body of Mr. Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably. Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite.",1
"“I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again.",1

""Indeed. He could have threatened to expose her identity to the Renaulds, jeopardizing her daughter's marriage."" ""You are mistaken, Hastings. He couldn't have blackmailed her, as she held the upper hand. Remember, Georges Conneau is still a murder suspect. A single word from her could lead him to the guillotine.""",1

This is not a crime of precision and organization that a detective would appreciate. The elaborate setup orchestrated by Georges Conneau is flawless, but the resolution, oh no!

Poirot insisted on speaking with Mrs.",1

Arriving and departing within half an hour is hardly entertaining,"" he replied. The man's words held a deeper meaning that almost eluded me.",1

That’s a big building near Knightsbridge, right?” Parker inquired, surprised. Mrs. Robinson nodded, a worried expression creeping onto her face. “Could it be haunted?” Parker dismissed the idea, declaring he had never heard of a haunted flat. “There were a few odd things, though,” Mrs. Robinson admitted. She went on to explain how they found the flat, despite being told it was already taken.

"Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well it sounds snobbish perhaps but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class.""",1
"“What brings you here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he asked suddenly, lifting me effortlessly off the ground. I could feel his powerful grip as he gently placed me back down. There was something intimidating about his presence, standing inches away from me, his gaze fixed on my face. “I’m just a wanderer,” I replied. “A gypsy at heart.” “Indeed, a clever disguise. You're not a journalist at heart, that much is clear. You're a seeker of thrills, willing to take what you desire. But there's more to it than that.",1
"He grinned maliciously. ""If you want a secret spread around, confide in a woman. Otherwise, zip it."" ""Do you doubt my ability to keep quiet?"" ""I don't doubt, I know."" He stood up. ""Regardless,"" I retorted spitefully, ""I will be sharing some information about tonight's events."" ""No doubt,"" he replied nonchalantly. ""How dare you?"" I exclaimed furiously. We stood face to face, glaring at each other with the intensity of sworn enemies. I observed his appearance for the first time, the short dark hair, the angular jaw, the scar on his tan cheek, the peculiar light grey eyes that met mine with a kind of daring mockery that was hard to define. There was a certain danger about him. ""You haven't thanked me yet for saving your life,"" I said with fake sweetness. I hit a nerve. I saw him visibly flinch. Instinctively, I knew that being reminded that he owed his life to me was something he despised. I didn't care. I wanted to wound him. ""I wish you hadn't!"" he burst out explosively. ""I'd rather be dead and done with it."" ""I'm pleased you acknowledge the debt. You can't escape it. I saved your life and I'm waiting for your 'Thank you.'"" If looks could kill, I think he would have taken the opportunity to end me right then and there. He roughly brushed past me. At the door, he glanced back and spoke over his shoulder. ""I will not thank you now or ever. But I recognize the debt. Someday, I will repay it."" With that, he left me with clenched fists, my heart racing. There were no more thrills that night. The next morning, I had breakfast in bed and got up late. As I walked onto the deck, Mrs. Blair greeted me. ""Good morning, Gipsy girl, come sit here by me. You look like you haven't slept well."" ""Why do you call me that?"" I inquired, taking a seat as instructed. ""Do you mind? It suits you somehow. It's that gipsy quality in you that sets you apart from everyone else. I had decided from the start that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board worth talking to."" ""That's amusing,"" I remarked, ""I had the same thought about you, although in your case it's more understandable. You're such a perfectly polished individual."" ""Nicely stated,"" Mrs. Blair acknowledged, nodding. ""Tell me about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you heading to South Africa?"" I shared a bit about my father's work. ""So you're Charles Beddingfeld's daughter? I suspected you weren't just any ordinary Miss! Are you off to Broken Hill to dig up more remains?"" ""Perhaps,"" I replied cautiously. ""I have other plans as well."" ""You're quite the enigmatic one. But you do seem weary this morning. Didn't you rest well? I can never stay awake on a ship. They say fools need ten hours of sleep! I could use twenty!"" She yawned, appearing like a drowsy kitten. ""An imbecilic steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return the roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it in such a dramatic manner, thrusting his arm through the vent and dropping them right on top of me. For a moment, I thought it was a bomb!"" ""Here comes your Colonel,"" I remarked as Colonel Race's tall figure emerged on the deck. ""He's not exclusively mine. In fact, he holds you in high regard, Gipsy girl. So don't flee."" ""I need something to bind my hair. It's more comfortable than a hat."" I quickly excused myself. For some reason, I felt uneasy around Colonel Race. He was one of the few who could make me feel bashful. I descended to my cabin and began searching for a wide ribbon or motor-veil to tame my unruly locks. Being a neat freak, I prefer my belongings arranged in a specific manner and I maintain them as such. Upon opening my drawer, it was evident that someone had been rifling through my things. Everything was disheveled and scattered. The other drawers and hanging cupboard bore the same story. It seemed as though someone had hurriedly and unsuccessfully searched for something. I sat on the bunk's edge with a serious expression. Who had been in my cabin searching, and what were they seeking? Was it the sheet of paper with scribbles that they were after? I shook my head, unsatisfied. That should be ancient history by now. But what else could it be? I needed to think. The events of the previous night, while thrilling, hadn't shed light on anything. Who was the young man who barged into my cabin so abruptly? I hadn't seen him on board before, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he a crew member or a passenger? Who attacked him? Why? And why was Cabin No. 17 at the center of it all? It was a puzzle, but there was no denying that some very odd incidents were unfolding on the Kilmorden Castle. I mentally listed the individuals I needed to keep an eye on. Excluding my visitor from the night before, whom I vowed to identify on board before another day passed, I pinpointed the following persons as deserving of my attention. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. As the owner of the Mill House, his presence on the Kilmorden Castle appeared somewhat coincidental. (2) Mr. Pagett, the ominous-looking secretary, whose keen interest in securing Cabin 17 had been quite evident. Note: Discover whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Reverend Edward Chichester. My only qualm with him was his insistence on Cabin 17, which could simply be attributed to his own unique character. Stubbornness can be a remarkable trait. Nonetheless, a conversation with Mr. Chichester was in order, I concluded. After swiftly tying a handkerchief around my unruly hair, I returned to the deck, resolute.",1
"“But I need more information to fully understand the situation. So, let's start from the beginning. You mentioned going to Florence.” “Actually, I never went to Florence. That's the truth of it.” “Then where did you go?” “I went back home to Marlow.” “Why on earth would you go back to Marlow?” “To check on my wife. She was unwell and expecting” “Your wife? I had no idea you were married.” “Yes, Sir Eustace, that's the truth. I kept that from you.” “How long have you been married?” “Just a little over eight years. I was married for only six months when I started working as your secretary.”",1

Did Black's account propose a clever scheme for suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did the wife, his other audience, perceive a similarly cunning plan for murder? My inclination leans towards the latter.""",1
"""Blair, hopefully. “He looks, I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace, but he does look as though he might murder someone.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes, especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race. “Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away tonight too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair—” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless, I was enjoying myself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a stern, silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn’t been asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend. I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round the deck. We walked around three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in sight. We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your father? A very interesting man on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region—” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes—slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian—an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion, that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head. Had he been pumping me? Were those slight inaccuracies just tests to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?""",1

"Poirot sat calmly, reading his letters. One was a request for a lecture, another an invitation from the Countess of Forfanock, and the last a mysterious letter from France. The urgent plea for help intrigued Poirot, prompting him to make hasty travel plans to meet the desperate writer. The letter hinted at danger and a secret that could cost a man his life.

"""I asked, 'What were you doing at that hour? Why weren't you in bed like a good Christian?' I was annoyed. Pagett always managed to be on the right side of things, playing the martyr. 'I was finishing the cabling work, Sir Eustace, and updating the diary,' he replied. 'Go on,' I urged. 'I decided to take a walk before retiring, Sir Eustace. I saw a man heading towards your cabin, and something about him seemed off. He hurried up the stairs near the saloon, and I trailed behind.'""",1

He didn’t even bother coming up to the hotel with us. I highly doubt he’s scared of Pagett, though. The whole thing is just plain frustrating. One secretary has disappeared without a trace, and the other one looks like a washed-up boxer. I can’t have him by my side looking like that. I’ll become the town’s joke.

"Bex, a wrist watch knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without a doubt, and smashed to pieces. They had no idea it would incriminate them. Carefully, he removed the shattered glass fragments. Suddenly, his expression shifted to complete shock. ""Oh my God!"" he exclaimed. ""What's wrong?"" ""The watch hands are pointing to seven o’clock!"" ""Impossible!"" exclaimed the magistrate, surprised.

Evidently, he assumed she was under my protection.",1
"""Guy Pagett grimaced, ""This will certainly impact the constituency,"" he commented sadly. I can't understand why, but I trust Pagett's judgment in these situations.

""She's also a foreigner, which complicates things,"" Pagett added gloomily. Once again, I have to agree with him.""",1
"""Yes, we must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s today, Anne?"" ""What about money, papa?"" I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. ""Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid."" ""I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa."" Papa looked pained. ""My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money."" ""I haven’t got any ready money."" Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. ""My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds."" ""That’s your overdraft, I fancy."" ""Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers."" I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. ""Stern silent men,"" I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. ""You have odd boots on, papa,"" I said. ""Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day."" In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. ""Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there."" I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of ""The Perils of Pamela,"" and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. ""It’s extremely kind of you,"" I said. ""But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly."" ""You don’t think?"" ""No, I don’t,"" I said firmly. He sighed. ""But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?"" ""Have adventures and see the world,"" I replied, without the least hesitation. ""Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand"" ""The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!"" ""I wish you would reconsider"" ""I can’t."" He sighed again. ""I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?"" ""No, doctor, I’m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you’ll see, something will turn up! You’ll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo."" My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa’s London solicitor. He came down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. ""My poor child,"" he said. ""My poor, poor child."" Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it.",1

The key to the desk had a dirty envelope with a handwritten label, which Poirot found suspicious. The Bakers, sympathetic to Miss Violet, recalled the events surrounding the will signing.

The cavity revealed crucial evidence, and Poirot wasted no time in examining it further.",1

Now, the diamond will be taken from you. When the full moon shines, both diamonds will reunite. It is fate.” Miss Marvell recounted, “I dismissed the initial note as a prank. The second one gave me pause. The third, received yesterday, left me uneasy. The situation is graver than I anticipated.”",1
"Maltravers, a man with a young and beautiful wife, seemingly gathered all his available funds to pay for a life insurance policy for her before taking his own life. This scenario, although tragic, is not unheard of in our society. A friend of mine, Alfred Wright, who happens to be a director at Northern Union, has urged me to look into the details of this case. However, I must admit that I am not particularly optimistic about uncovering the truth. If the cause of death had been listed as heart failure, I might have been more hopeful. The term ""heart failure"" often serves as a convenient cover-up in such situations.",1
"Moreover, what am I to occupy myself with in Pretoria? Marvel at the design of the Union buildings and catch the reverberations of gunfire in Johannesburg? I would likely be confined there for an unknown duration. Rumor has it they have sabotaged the railway line already. To make matters worse, one can't even find a decent drink there. The entire area has been placed under martial law since two days ago. ""My dear friend,"" I interjected, ""it seems you fail to grasp that I am investigating the situation on the Rand. How in the world am I expected to do so from Pretoria? I appreciate your concern for my well-being, but rest assured, I will manage just fine.""",1

If we go round here, we can take a short cut across which will bring us to the back of the Villa much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, In some cases two identical weapons would be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, began his task. Having watched at work, I was keenly interested. bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to lips, and, as though noting it, flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said. knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care, also the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at “You saw these?” “Yes, I saw them,” replied the other. His face remained inscrutable. Suddenly stiffened. “Dr. Durand!” “Yes?” The doctor came forward. “There is foam on the lips. You observed it?” “I didn’t notice it, I must admit.” “But you observe it now?” “Oh, certainly.” again shot a question at. “You noticed it without doubt?” The other did not reply. proceeded. The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes.",1

I find marriage delightful, even with Clarence!” I dismissed her casual attitude. “What concerns me,” I stated firmly, “is Colonel Race's involvement in all of this. He is definitely part of the puzzle.” “Do you truly believe it was mere coincidence, his recounting that tale?” “Absolutely not,” I asserted. “He was observing us all intently. You recall, some of the diamonds were recovered, but not all.""",1
"""Look, here he comes pushing his wheelbarrow.” It was clear that an older gentleman was making his way across the driveway with a load of seedlings. Poirot signaled to him, causing the man to stop and shuffle towards us. “Are you planning to request one of his boots to compare against the footprints?” I inquired eagerly. My confidence in Poirot started to return. If he deemed the footprints in the right-hand bed significant, then they must be. “Precisely,” responded Poirot. “But wouldn’t he find it rather strange?” “He won’t give it a second thought.",1
"The roots of the tree in question extended all the way to the rear of the bed, making it necessary to step on the bed in order to reach them. The commissary pointed out that due to the dry weather, no footprints would be visible on the paths or driveway, but they would be noticeable on the soft soil of the flower-bed. Poirot carefully inspected the smooth surface of the bed, confirming Bex's observation that there were no marks or indentations. Satisfied, Poirot abruptly shifted his attention to the neighboring flower-bed for further examination.",1

The meeting was related to South American shares, prompting Davenheim to schedule it.”“Did Davenheim have investments in South America?”“It seems likely.

"""No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” “More than unlikely impossible!” said Poirot quietly. “Eh?” The inspector stared. Poirot smiled modestly. “I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case. I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say ‘Go!’” “Go!” I said. With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning. “Well, mon ami?” he demanded of me breathlessly. “Forty-six seconds,” I replied. “You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.” “Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door. Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen. “This necklace it was, without doubt, insured?” Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question. “Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.” “But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.” “I comprehend, madame,” said Poirot soothingly. “I comprehend perfectly. To la femme sentiment is everything is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact.” “Of course, of course,” said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. “Still” He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers. With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman. “Oh, oh, my necklace!” She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round. “Where was it?” demanded Opalsen. “Maid’s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.” “You permit, madame?” said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow. “I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time being,” said the inspector. “We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible.” Mr. Opalsen frowned. “Is that necessary?” “I’m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.” “Oh, let him take it, Ed!” cried his wife. “I’d feel safer if he did. I shouldn’t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed it of her.” “There, there, my dear, don’t take on so.” I felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot. “Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer needed.” Once outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise, he remarked: “I should rather like to see the room next door.” The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a large double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably, and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window. “The service leaves to be desired,” he observed dryly. He was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have fallen into a brown study. “Well?” I demanded impatiently. “What did we come in here for?” He started. “Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left, “it is bolted.” Poirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking. “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.” “But the maid did!” “Why do you say that?” “Why,” I stammered, “they were found actually in her mattress.” “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.” “What?” “Imitation, mon ami.” The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!” “Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm. “Where?” “We must tell the Opalsens at once.” “I think not.” “But that poor woman” “Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.” “But the thief may escape with them!” “As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?” “Oh!” I said, bewildered. “Exactly,” said Poirot, beaming. “We start again.” He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.",1

"""Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, cellela!” The old woman tossed her head scornfully. “Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.” “Voilà,” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the truth.” “Not at all,” said the examining magistrate soothingly. “We were surprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were ” he paused delicately. “Eh? It was that without doubt?” “How should I know? But what will you?

The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not last night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.” “English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: “‘Yeas yeas butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’” “Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, voilà tout! So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",1
"""Despite his subordinate role, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sir Eustace was heavily influenced by his secretary, Guy Pagett. Suzanne disagreed, insisting that the true mastermind, the elusive ""Colonel,"" was pulling the strings from afar. Sir Eustace's low profile may have been a deliberate choice, a way to avoid the spotlight. Perhaps his secretary's power was just a facade, a distraction from the real puppeteer lurking in the shadows, continents away.""",1
"""His name is John Eardsley,"" Colonel Race announced abruptly before walking away. I watched him leave, feeling a mix of emotions. Harry's voice broke through my thoughts, pleading for forgiveness. As he reached out to hold my hand, I instinctively pulled away. ""Why did you lie to me?"" I asked, my voice tinged with hurt. ""I was scared that you would only care about the wealth and power that came with me. I wanted you to love me for who I am, stripped of all the superficialities.""",1
"He embraced me tightly, whispering ""Black-haired enchantress"" as he planted kisses on my head, eyes, and lips. ""Time to get down to business,"" he declared, setting me free. ""Fetch the cans of paraffin."" Obeying his command, I watched as he busied himself in the cabin. Soon enough, he appeared on the hut's roof, carrying something in his arms. After a short while, he returned to me. ""Head to the boat. We need to transport it to the other side of the island."" Grabbing the paraffin, he instructed me to vanish. ""They're approaching,"" I warned quietly, noticing a blur emerging from the far shore. He hurried down to me. ""Just in the nick of time. Where the devil is the boat?"" Both vessels had been set adrift.",1
"I couldn't help but notice that you were three minutes late, despite saying it would only be two. Your scientific background must be to blame for that, as women are usually quite punctual. Despite finding Lord Nasby tiresome, I left feeling triumphant. My plan had worked better than expected - Lord Nasby was surprisingly friendly. Now, all that was left was to prove myself. Once alone in my room, I carefully examined my valuable piece of paper.",1
"“Indeed,” I replied. “The second blade we discovered in the vagrant belonged to Mrs. Renauld. There were two in total.” “Certainly, and since they were identical, it is logical to assume that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that is not my main concern. In fact, I have a suspicion about that. No, the most condemning evidence against him is once again psychological heredity, my friend, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, ultimately, is the offspring of Georges Conneau.” His manner was serious and sincere, and I was influenced despite myself. “What is this suspicion you mentioned earlier?” I inquired. In response, Poirot checked his pocket watch, and then inquired: “When does the Calais afternoon ship depart?” “Around five o'clock, I believe.” “That will suffice. We have just enough time.” “Are you headed to England?” “Yes, my dear friend.” “For what reason?” “To locate a potential witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar grin on his face, Poirot answered: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you discover her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her, but I can infer a great deal. It is safe to assume that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name struck a chord with M. Stonor, although clearly not in connection with the Renauld family, it is likely that she is involved in the performing arts. Jack Renauld was a wealthy young man, twenty years old. The stage was likely the realm of his first love. It also aligns with M. Renauld’s attempt to appease her with a check. I am confident I will locate her especially with the aid of this.” And he produced the photograph I had previously seen him retrieve from Jack Renauld’s desk. “With love from Bella,” was scribbled across the corner, but it was not that which captivated me. The resemblance was not perfect, but nonetheless unmistakable to me. I felt a chill, as if some unspeakable disaster had occurred. It was the face of Cinderella. For a moment or two I sat frozen, the photograph still in my grasp. Then, mustering all my courage to appear unfazed, I returned it. Simultaneously, I cast a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief, he did not seem to be observing me. Any abnormality in my demeanor had certainly eluded him. He sprang energetically to his feet. “We must depart quickly. We must leave with all haste. All is well the sea it will be calm!” In the flurry of departure, I had no time for contemplation, but once aboard the ship, shielded from Poirot’s scrutiny (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”), I composed myself, and analyzed the facts impartially. How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance from the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had assumed? Or had I simply deluded myself, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister motive? But in any case, why was he determined to find this girl? Did he suspect her of witnessing Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect but that was impossible! The girl harbored no animosity towards the elder Renauld, no conceivable reason for desiring his demise. What drew her back to the scene of the murder? I meticulously reviewed the facts. She must have disembarked at Calais where I bid her farewell that day. No wonder I had been unsuccessful in locating her on the ship. If she had dined in Calais, and subsequently boarded a train to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève right around the time Françoise indicated. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either checked into a hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime occurred on Tuesday night. By Thursday morning, she was back in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I highly doubted it. What kept her there the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had informed her (as we believed at the time) that he was at sea en route to Buenos Ayres. Perhaps she was aware that the Anzora had not set sail. But to know that she must have encountered Jack. Was that what Poirot was seeking? Had Jack Renauld, returning to visit Marthe Daubreuil, crossed paths instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had callously abandoned? I began to see the light. If that were indeed the case, it could provide Jack with the alibi he required. Yet under those circumstances, his silence seemed perplexing. Why did he not speak up boldly? Did he fear that this former entanglement of his would come to the attention of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The matter had been innocuous enough, a foolish youthful romance, and I cynically pondered that the son of a millionaire was unlikely to be discarded by a penniless French girl, who moreover adored him fervently, without a much weightier reason. Altogether, I found the situation perplexing and unsatisfactory. I detested being linked with Poirot in pursuing this girl, but I could not discern a way to avoid it, without divulging everything to him, and for some reason, I was hesitant to do so. Poirot reemerged brisk and cheerful at Dover, and our journey to London proceeded without incident. It was well past nine o’clock upon our arrival, and I assumed that we would promptly return to our lodgings and wait until morning. However, Poirot had different intentions. “We must not dawdle, my friend. The news of the arrest will not be in the English newspapers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must not dawdle.” I did not entirely comprehend his rationale, but I simply inquired how he intended to locate the girl.",1
"Renauld immediately followed the old woman upstairs while I lingered in the salon. Poirot eventually emerged with a serious expression on his face. ""There you are, Hastings! By thunder, there are troubles ahead!"" I was taken aback. ""What troubles do you speak of?"" I asked. Poirot, deep in thought, replied, ""I never would have imagined it, but women can be quite unpredictable."" Just then, I spotted Jack and Marthe Daubreuil approaching outside. Poirot hurriedly left the room to intercept them on the steps. ""Do not come in. It's best to stay out. Your mother is in quite a state,"" he informed them. ""I understand, I understand,"" Jack Renauld replied solemnly.",1
"We returned to the bridge, followed by a woman burdened with all the household items stacked precariously on her head, including a frying pan. Suzanne regretted not having her camera, but Colonel Race assured her that opportunities would arise. As we reached the bridge, Colonel Race proposed exploring the rainbow forest, questioning whether we were afraid of getting wet. Suzanne and I agreed to join him, while Sir Eustace headed back to the hotel. However, the rainbow forest did not meet my expectations.",1
"He spat murderously, and again and again. Two groans and a splash were heard. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, reaching for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. The rifle was reloaded when he turned for it. Catching me close with his left arm, he kissed me once savagely before turning to the window again. Suddenly, he shouted. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion. Black-haired witch!” Embracing me, he kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I followed his orders. He was occupied inside the hut. Soon, he was seen on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” Picking up the paraffin as I disappeared, he heard me softly call out, “They’re coming back.” The blur was seen moving from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift. Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side. “We’ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it matters. I can get you across. It’s the wrong side for a boattoo many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side for Livingstone.” “I can swim a little farther than that. What’s the danger, Harry?” For I had seen the grim look on his face. “Sharks?” “No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you’re sharp, Anne. Crocs, that’s the trouble.” “Crocodiles?” “Yes, don’t think of them or say your prayers, whichever you feel inclined.” We plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know. The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios. His name was Ned perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me. It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough. Any message that comes genuinely from me will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.” “Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?” “Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’” “Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head in and withdrawing it immediately. I stood up. “And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked demurely. Harry came close to me. “My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring his neck. And as for you” “Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited. “I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!” “What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically. “And doesn’t he change his mind overnight!” (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) As I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn for a quiet life and that’s just the one thing I don’t seem able to have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief of getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of intrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful creature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or two of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl. What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there. I had a dream a terrible dream that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn’t there and her bed hadn’t been slept in.” She looked at me appealingly. “What shall I do, Sir Eustace?” Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially. “What does Race say about it?” Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society. “I can’t find him anywhere.” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.” “Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can be done is being done but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted theory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path near the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately off the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early on the Monday morning. I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg. A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems pretty clear that she can’t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy in interfering in other people’s affairs. If I were this young fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came asking questions about my love affairs. Later. It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear, but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored. The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg.",1
"I never suspected the extent of my own foolishness. I foolishly believed I had ample time before her arrival at the Villa. Mademoiselle Marthe was certainly cunning.” “Her goal was to kill Mrs. Renauld?” “Indeed. By doing so, the entire inheritance would go to her son. But it would have been a reckless move, my friend! Beside Marthe Daubreuil's lifeless body, I discovered a pad, a small bottle of chloroform, and a syringe filled with a lethal dose of morphine. Do you see? First the chloroform, then, once the victim is unconscious, the needle's prick.",1
"""Are you serious?"" ""Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds."" ""How long had he been dead?"" Dr. Durand provided the answer. ""I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have occurred at least seven, and possibly ten hours earlier."" ""Hm, so between midnight and 3 a.m."" ""Precisely, and Madame Renauld’s testimony places it after 2 a.m. which further narrows down the time frame. Death was instant and clearly not self-inflicted.""",1

"""Pas du tout,” said Poirot firmly. “She sought my help on the advice of Mary Cavendish. Upon learning that Mary Marvell, her enemy, had visited, she quickly changed her mind, seizing the opportunity presented by your words. A brief interrogation revealed that you had mentioned the letters to her, not the other way around. She eagerly embraced the chance your words provided.” “I find that hard to believe,” I retorted, feeling offended. “Si, si, mon ami, it is regrettable that you do not study psychology,"" replied Poirot.",1
"Poirot studied me carefully, giving advice to stick to my words. He mentioned arranging a marriage for me, but I declined. Poirot, obsessed with neatness, asked about Mademoiselle Cinderella's whereabouts. Despite my misgivings, I followed Poirot's lead, knowing he had a keen eye for human nature. As he left for Paris, I pondered his mysterious insights. I decided to inquire about Cinderella at the Hôtel du Phare, but to my surprise, she was not there. The concierge denied her presence, hinting at Poirot's earlier visit. His description matched Poirot's, confirming his secret investigation.",1
"During our brief encounter, it was evident that he was a coward at heart. Without delay, I saw the fear in his eyes as we locked gazes.

Their paths had crossed with mine at a hotel dinner, where my unexpected presence had shaken him to the core after believing me to be dead. Despite marrying young, Anita had grown distant from him over time.",1
"”The heavy thud echoed from inside the room. Without hesitation, the key twisted in the lock and the door creaked open. Cinderella, visibly shaken, motioned for us to enter. “Is she unharmed?” Poirot inquired urgently. “Yes, I arrived just in time. She was barely conscious.” Mrs. Renauld lay on the bed, struggling for air. “She tried to strangle me,” she whispered through labored breaths. The young woman picked up an object from the ground and passed it to Poirot. It was a coiled silk rope ladder, delicate yet sturdy. “An escape plan,” Poirot concluded. “She intended to flee through the window while we forced the door. And the other?” The woman stepped back and silently pointed in response.”",1
"Poirot listened intently as Marthe revealed a shocking revelation. She described a confrontation between M. Renauld and a tramp in the garden, hinting that they might be the same person. Poirot pondered over the implications of her story, considering the possibility that Jack Renauld might have murdered his own father for money. As they made their way back to the Villa, Poirot's mind raced with new suspicions and clues. Suddenly, a car pulled up outside with Giraud, Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes. Poirot hastily searched through Jack Renauld's belongings, finding a crucial piece of evidence hidden among ties and handkerchiefs. With a triumphant cry, he pocketed the item and hurriedly left the room before Giraud could interfere.",1

As he and Hastings move into a flat in Montagu Mansions, they soon discover that there is more to their new neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, than meets the eye. With a cleverly devised scheme involving descending through the coal-lift, Poirot sets the stage for an unexpected turn of events. The following day, as Poirot shares the details of the stolen plans and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the deaths of Luigi Valdarno and Miss Elsa Hardt, Hastings realizes that they are about to embark on a thrilling adventure that will test their wits and courage to the fullest.",1
"Poirot examined the crime scene meticulously, his attention caught by a piece of lead-piping near the spade. Giraud dismissed it as irrelevant, but Poirot's curiosity was piqued. He then proceeded to explore the locked shed, much to Giraud's annoyance. The detective seemed focused on trivial details, such as a whitewashed line around the grave, which he questioned M. Bex about. Despite Poirot's unconventional methods, Giraud was impressed by his efficiency. As they left the scene, Giraud continued his thorough search, while Poirot hinted at a deeper mystery surrounding the case.",1
"""Is that really necessary?"" ""I'm afraid so, sir. Just a formality."" ""Oh, let him take it, Ed!"" cried his wife. ""I'd feel safer if he did. I shouldn't sleep a wink thinking someone else might try and get hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed it of her."" ""There, there, my dear, don't take on so."" I felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot. ""Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer needed."" Once outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise, he remarked: ""I should rather like to see the room next door."" The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, a large double one, was empty. Dust lay about noticeably, and Poirot grimaced as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window. ""The service leaves much to be desired,"" he said dryly. He stared thoughtfully out of the window, lost in thought. ""Well?"" I demanded impatiently. ""What did we come in here for?"" He started. ""Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also."" ""Well,"" I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left, ""it is bolted."" Poirot nodded. He still seemed lost in thought. ""And, anyway,"" I continued, ""what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you'd had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn't go wrong over."" Poirot shook his head. ""The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls."" ""But the maid did!"" ""Why do you say that?"" ""Why,"" I stammered, ""they were found actually in her mattress."" ""Ta, ta, ta!"" said Poirot impatiently. ""Those were not the pearls."" ""What?"" ""Imitation, mon ami."" The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. ""The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!"" ""Come!"" I cried, pulling at his arm. ""Where?"" ""We must tell the Opalsens immediately."" ""I think not."" ""But that poor woman"" ""Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe."" ""But the thief may escape with them!"" ""As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully tonight were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?"" ""Oh!"" I said, bewildered. ""Exactly,"" said Poirot, beaming. ""We start again."" He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.",1
"A journal can be a tool for documenting the peculiarities of others, but not one's own."" ""However, there is such a thing as unintentional self-disclosure."" ""In the view of a psychoanalyst, everything is considered vile,"" I stated in a knowing tone. ""I imagine you've had quite the adventurous life, Colonel Race?"" inquired Miss Beddingfeld, fixing him with a mesmerized gaze. This is how they operate, these women! Othello captivated Desdemona with his tales, yet, oh, didn't Desdemona captivate Othello with her attentive demeanor? Anyway, the young woman certainly piqued Race's interest. He proceeded to recount tales of bravery.",1
""" Poirot took a seat once more, fixing his gaze on me, his contemplative demeanor more pronounced than before. “So, Hastings, are you absolutely convinced that Madame Daubreuil is responsible for M. Renauld’s death?” “Yes.” “But why?” The question caught me off guard with its suddenness. “Why?” I hesitated. “Why? Well, because…” My voice trailed off. Poirot gave a knowing look. “You see, you hit a roadblock immediately. Why would Madame Daubreuil (for clarity’s sake, let’s refer to her as such) want to kill M. Renauld? We can’t seem to find a single reason. She gains nothing from his death; whether as a lover or a blackmailer, she has nothing to gain. A murder without a motive is inconceivable.",1

""I was under the impression that, seeing as I was quite a distance away, you had not identified me, Sir Eustace."" ""Identified me where?"" ""In Marlow, Sir Eustace?"" ""In Marlow? Why on earth were you in Marlow?"" ""I thought that was clear."" ""I am becoming more perplexed by the moment. Let's rewind. You traveled to Florence."" ""So you truly did not know and failed to recognize me!"" ""Based on what I can gather, it appears you have needlessly revealed yourself, driven by your guilty conscience.""",1
"""She insists he is innocent, and we must act to save him,” she declared with urgency, falling silent to contemplate. Poirot, observing keenly, probed further, ""Is there something you have not shared that could be of importance?"" She nodded with confusion, ""Yes, there is, but it may seem absurd. M. Giraud unexpectedly called me to identify the man in the shed."" She gestured towards the shed. “I couldn't at the moment, but upon reflection…” “Go on,” urged Poirot. “It seems odd, yet I am almost certain. Here it is. On the morning of Mr. Renauld's murder, I overheard a quarrel between him and a tramp in the garden. The tramp, in tattered rags, seemed to be demanding money. I had to leave abruptly when my mother called. But I can't shake the feeling that the tramp and the dead man are one and the same.” Poirot exclaimed in realization. “Why didn't you mention this before?” She explained, “Initially, the face only rang a faint bell. The man's attire and demeanor suggested otherwise. But tell me, could the tramp have attacked and killed Mr. Renauld, taking his belongings?” Poirot mused, “It's a possibility. There are gaps, but worth considering. I need to think.” A voice interrupted. “Mother,” Marthe whispered, “I must go.” And she vanished amidst the trees. “Let's go,” directed Poirot, leading the way back to the Villa. As we walked, I inquired, “What's your take on this? Did she tell the truth, or was it to shield her lover?” Poirot replied, “A peculiar tale, yet I trust it's the truth. Inadvertently, Marthe disclosed a vital truth and contradicted Jack Renauld's account. Did you notice his hesitation when asked about seeing Marthe Daubreuil that night? His answer 'Yes' seemed dubious. I needed to speak with Marthe before he could warn her. Three words provided the answers. When asked about Jack's presence that night, she replied 'He told me.' Now, Hastings, why was Jack here that night, and whom did he see?” “Surely,” I gasped, “you can't believe a boy would kill his father.” “You're too sentimental,” chided Poirot. “Some mothers kill their children for money. After that, anything is plausible.” “What about the tramp?” “Giraud would suggest he was an accomplice, eliminated post-crime by Renauld. The hair on the dagger?” “Giraud claims it's not a woman's hair,” said Poirot with a grin. “But it is, and of a specific woman.” “Madame Daubreuil,” I asserted. “Perhaps,” Poirot teased. “What next?” I asked, entering the Villa. “I need to search Jack Renauld's belongings,” explained Poirot. “Giraud may have missed crucial evidence. Let's begin.” Methodically, Poirot searched through each drawer. Suddenly, a car pulled up outside. “Giraud and Jack Renauld are here,” I exclaimed. “Could he not wait?” grumbled Poirot. Hastily, he found a photograph, stashed it, and rushed out, leaving the room in disarray.",1

You recall that case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?"" I nodded. ""Please, share the story,"" urged Miss Beddingfeld.",1
"""I can't reveal any secrets."" ""Tell us something, even if you have to make it up for us."" ""Well, what do you think about the infamous 'Man in the Brown Suit' having traveled with us?"" ""What?"" My face lost color and then regained it. Luckily, Colonel Race wasn't looking at me. ""It's true, I believe. Every port was on the lookout for him and he tricked Pedler into bringing him along as his secretary!"" ""Not Mr. Pagett?"" ""Oh no, not Pagett, the other guy. Rayburn, that was his name."" ""Have they caught him?"" Suzanne asked, squeezing my hand under the table. I waited anxiously for the answer. ""He seems to have vanished into thin air."" ""How is Sir Eustace handling it?"" ""Considers it a personal insult from Fate."" Later that day, we received a note from Sir Eustace inviting us to tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was in a pitiful state, pouring out his woes to us, comforted by Suzanne's murmurs of sympathy. ""First, a complete stranger has the audacity to get herself murdered in my house just to bother me, I believe. Why my house? Out of all the houses in Great Britain, why choose the Mill House? What had I ever done to her that she had to get herself killed there?"" Suzanne made sympathetic noises again, and Sir Eustace continued in a more aggrieved tone. ""And if that wasn't enough, the man who killed her has the audacity, the immense audacity, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, can you imagine! I'm done with secretaries, I won't have any more. They're either hidden murderers or drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett's black eye? Of course you have. How can I walk around with a secretary like that? And his face is such an unpleasant shade of yellow, just the wrong color to go with a black eye. I'm done with secretaries unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with soft eyes, who will hold my hand when I'm upset. What do you say, Miss Anne? Will you take the job?"" ""How often will I have to hold your hand?"" I asked, joking. ""All day long,"" Sir Eustace replied gallantly. ""I won't get much typing done at that rate,"" I reminded him. ""That's not important. All this work is Pagett's fault. He overworks me. I'm looking forward to leaving him in Cape Town."" ""Is he staying behind?"" ""Yes, he'll have a great time investigating Rayburn. That's the kind of thing Pagett loves. He adores intrigue. But I'm serious about my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair can chaperone, and you can have a break now and then to search for clues."" ""Thank you, Sir Eustace,"" I said cautiously, ""but I think I'll be leaving for Durban tonight.""",1
"""Numerous stories, both accurate and fabricated, circulated regarding the infamous gem rumored to be insured for an astonishing fifty thousand pounds. As I approached Poirot to welcome our elegant client, Miss Marvell, a flood of information about the stone rushed through my mind. She was petite, delicate, and possessed a youthful appearance, characterized by her innocent, azure eyes. Poirot kindly offered her a seat, prompting her to immediately divulge her concerns. ""You may perceive me as naive, Monsieur Poirot,"" she began, ""but after Lord Cronshaw recounted your remarkable resolution of his nephew's mysterious demise, I knew I had to seek your guidance.""",1

Poirot's attention seemed to shift to something else entirely - a small, discolored segment of lead piping resting near the shovel. He gently prodded it with his fingertip. ""Could this also be linked to the deceased?"" he inquired, his tone carrying a hint of sarcasm. Giraud simply shrugged, showing his indifference.",1
"As Lord Yardly and I stood in the dimly lit room, a sudden darkness enveloped us. The sound of a door slamming echoed through the silence, followed by a chilling scream that sent shivers down our spines. ""Maude!"" Lord Yardly exclaimed, his voice filled with fear. Panic set in as we fumbled in the dark, attempting to reach the source of the disturbance. Finally, we located the door and flung it open. The scene before us was horrifying - Lady Yardly lay motionless on the cold floor, a red mark marring her pale throat where her necklace had been violently torn away. Unsure if she was alive or dead, we hovered over her, waiting for any sign of life. Slowly, her eyes fluttered open, revealing the fear and pain hidden within.",1

As I walked away from the scene, my attention was caught by a peculiar sight near the hedge. What appeared to be a bush turned out to be Giraud, the detective, signaling for silence. With a stern expression, he chastised me for interrupting their conversation, revealing his true intentions. Our encounter left me even more curious about the mysteries surrounding the young couple and the tragic events that seemed to bind them together.",1

"""The nature of crimes remains constant,"" Poirot observed calmly. Giraud's demeanor indicated his readiness to oppose. He did not want to share any connection with the other man, and it seemed likely that he would withhold any crucial information he discovered. ""The investigating official,"" Bex started to say. But Giraud cut him off bluntly: ""Who cares about the investigating official! The crucial factor is the light. It will disappear within the next thirty minutes. I am well-informed about the situation, and the residents of the residence will manage fine until the next day, but if we hope to uncover the perpetrators, this is where we must search.""",1

"How much did Poirot really know? Was he aware that my fellow passenger on the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same person? What was the reason for his visit to the Hôtel du Phare? Was it truly on my behalf, as I had initially believed? Or was I simply being naive, and was there a more sinister motive behind his actions? Regardless, why was he so determined to locate this young woman? Did he suspect her involvement in Jack Renauld's murder? But that couldn't be possible! She had no reason to harm the victim, no motive for his death. So why did she return to the scene of the crime? I meticulously reviewed all the details.",1
"Poirot and I had arrived at Marsdon Manor to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had recently insured his life for a large sum of money. The circumstances surrounding his death seemed suspicious, especially considering his financial troubles. We spoke to Dr. Bernard, the only doctor in the area, who confirmed that Mr. Maltravers had died from an internal hemorrhage. However, the doctor's vague responses raised some doubts in Poirot's mind. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was distraught and beautiful, and she shared that her husband had insured his life because he believed he would die soon. Poirot noticed a discrepancy in the case, but before we could investigate further, a tall young man approached us.",1
"""It’s largely thanks to him and his generous donations that this project is progressing. He even influenced the design of it."" Poirot nodded in contemplation. Then he stated, ""The location chosen to bury the body was not ideal, was it? If the men had started digging, everything would have been uncovered."" ""Precisely,"" Giraud exclaimed in triumph. ""That indicates they were unfamiliar with the area. It's a strong form of circumstantial evidence."" ""Indeed,"" Poirot responded with uncertainty. ""No one familiar with the area would bury a body there unless they intended for it to be found.""",1
"By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more. Now, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I place the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.” I stared at him, stupefied. “But how? Why? How can you possibly know?” “Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained. Mon ami, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do you not now see what is so glaringly plain?” “My dear Poirot, I can’t see anything glaring about it. I did think I was beginning to see my way before, but I’m now hopelessly fogged.” Poirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. “Mon Dieu! But it is triste! A good intelligence and so deplorably lacking in method. There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells. I will impart it to you ” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, ne vous impatientez pas! I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, mon ami, let me ask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?” “Georges Conneau,” I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily. “Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that was Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as Georges Conneau is not Jack Renauld, follows that the third case is put out of court. And, still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is equally so. So we are forced to the second that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “Bien! Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but ” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love.” I shook my head perplexed. “Mais, oui, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so dearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?” I stared dumbfounded.",1
"Renauld turned to the magistrate and expressed his regrets: “I should have discussed this with my husband, but I believed it was just a passing fancy that would fade away faster if we ignored it. Now I see my mistake, but at that time, my husband was so preoccupied and troubled, acting unlike himself, that I wanted to spare him any extra burden.” M. Hautet acknowledged her words. “And when you disclosed your plans with Mademoiselle Daubreuil to your father,” he continued, “was he shocked?” “He was utterly stunned.",1
"We walked around the deck three times before settling into adjacent deck chairs. The night was silent, with no one else in sight. Colonel Race was a man of few words, a Rhodesian with a stern demeanor that intrigued me. As we sat there in silence, I couldn't help but wonder if he could be more than just a dance partner. I entertained the thought of marriage, even though he hadn't proposed. It was always best to be prepared, as the Boy Scouts say. In the dim light, I found myself considering the possibility of a future together, a future that seemed both thrilling and dangerous.",1
"We managed to track down Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent, after a long search. He recognized the name Bella Duveen as one of the Dulcibella Kids, a pair of acrobat and singer sisters currently performing in Coventry. Poirot decided to attend their variety show, where he saw them perform and recognized Cinderella as one of the sisters. After the show, Cinderella approached us in fear, confessing that she was the one who took the dagger and asking if we would turn her in to the police. In a surprising turn of events, I declared my love for her and promised to protect her.",1
"I had a hunch early on that someone was exploiting the superstitious beliefs surrounding a series of deaths. The death of Sir John Willard seemed to trigger a frenzy of superstition, but it was Mr. Bleibner's murder that really caught my attention. Unlike Sir John, Mr. Bleibner was a wealthy man, making him a more likely target for foul play. My sources in New York provided some intriguing leads that pointed towards a more sinister motive behind the deaths.",1
"I hurried out into the hallway and nearly bumped into Mrs. Middleton before the sound of a gunshot rang out. The gun-room door was locked from the inside, forcing us to circle around the house to reach the window. By the time we got there, the murderer had already fled. My heart ached for my deceased uncle,” she hesitated, her voice trembling, “who was found with a fatal gunshot wound to the head. It was clear he was gone. I instructed Mrs. Middleton to fetch the authorities while I refrained from disturbing anything in the room, ensuring it remained undisturbed. As for the murder weapon?” “I can hazard a guess, Captain Hastings. A pair of my husband’s revolvers were displayed on the wall. One of them is now missing. The police were notified and the remaining one was confiscated for examination. Once the bullet is retrieved, the truth will be revealed.” “May I visit the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have completed their investigation. However, the body has been removed.” She led me to the crime scene. Just then, Havering entered the hallway and his wife rushed to him with an immediate apology. I was left alone to conduct my inquiries. I must admit, they were rather underwhelming. In novels, clues are abundant, but I failed to find anything noteworthy except for a sizable bloodstain on the carpet where the victim had fallen. I meticulously examined every detail and captured a few photographs of the room with my camera. The ground outside the window was too disturbed to yield any useful information. Hunter’s Lodge had no more secrets to reveal to me. I bid farewell to the Haverings and departed in the awaiting car. My journey led me to the Matlock Arms where I met with Japp to view the deceased. Harrington Pace was a slender, American-looking man, shot in the back of the head at close range. “He turned away for a moment,” Japp commented, “and the culprit seized a revolver, firing the fatal shot. The revolver provided by Mrs. Havering was fully loaded, and I assume the missing one was as well. People do foolish things. Imagine keeping two loaded revolvers hanging on your wall.” “What are your thoughts on the case?” I inquired as we exited the grim chamber. “Initially, I suspected Havering. He has a shady past. Questionable incidents during his time at Oxford, debts he’s struggling to repay, and a potential inheritance from his uncle. His alibi checks out, though, and he was seen boarding a train to London. As for the black beard, it likely grew miraculously fast during the journey from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. We must focus on Mr. Pace’s American connections to find the killer. I interviewed the housekeeper and Mrs. Havering, their stories align. Unfortunately, Mrs. Havering did not witness the culprit. She’s astute, and her observations could have been invaluable.” I penned a detailed report to Poirot, including new developments. The extracted bullet matched the police revolver, Havering's alibi was confirmed, and a mysterious parcel containing the missing revolver was discovered in Ealing. Poirot's wire arrived during breakfast the next day: “The black-bearded man was not Havering. Provide descriptions of the housekeeper and Mrs. Havering’s attire. Stop wasting time on poorly shot interior photographs.” Poirot’s tone irked me, and I sensed a hint of jealousy. Describing the women's clothing felt pointless, but I obliged. A subsequent wire from Poirot advised Japp to arrest the housekeeper promptly. Bewildered, I shared the message with Japp, who muttered under his breath, “Poirot knows his business. If he says so, there’s merit to it.”",1

I won’t detain you long, but I am eager to return to the village now that I have completed my examination here.” “I am not yet aware of the details” “Exactly,” Japp replied reassuringly.",1
"His attitude towards me had shifted, furthermore. It exuded a discomforting warmth that seemed out of place, making me sick. The man was a deceitful hypocrite. First he attempted to kill me, and now he showered me with compliments! Did he really think I hadn't recognized him that night on the boat? No, it was all an act, a performance that he expected me to go along with, a smirk on his face the whole time. I was like a helpless lamb, following his every command. My belongings were stowed in my sleeping quarters, a two-berth compartment all to myself. The clock read twelve minutes past eight. In just three minutes, the train would depart. But Paggett had not accounted for Suzanne. ""It's going to be a dreadfully hot journey, Anne,"" she suddenly remarked. ""Especially crossing the Karoo tomorrow. Do you have any eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you?"" It was clear what I had to do. ""Oh dear,"" I exclaimed. ""I must have left my eau-de-Cologne on the hotel dressing table."" Suzanne's authoritative nature came in handy. She turned to Pagett with urgency. ""Mr. Pagett. Hurry. There's a chemist right across from the station. Anne needs some eau-de-Cologne."" He hesitated, but Suzanne's commanding tone was too much for him. She is a natural leader. He left. Suzanne watched him until he vanished. ""Quick, Anne, get off on the other side in case he's still around, watching us from the end of the platform. Forget about your luggage. You can deal with that tomorrow. Oh, I hope the train leaves on time!"" I exited through the gate on the opposite side and descended. No one was paying attention to me. I could see Suzanne standing where I left her, talking to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to move. Then I heard hurried footsteps coming up the platform. I retreated to the shelter of a nearby bookstall and observed. Suzanne stopped waving her handkerchief at the departing train. ""Too late, Mr. Pagett,"" she said cheerfully. ""She's already gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a shame we didn't think of it earlier!"" As they walked out of the station, not far from where I stood, Guy Pagett was visibly sweating. He must have raced to the chemist and back. ""Shall I call you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?"" Suzanne was playing her part perfectly. ""Yes, please. Can I drop you off somewhere? Do you have much to do for Sir Eustace? I do wish Anne Beddingfeld was joining us tomorrow. I don't like the idea of a young girl like her traveling to Durban alone. But she was determined. Perhaps there's some attraction there, I suspect."" They moved out of earshot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.

"Part of me was horrified by the sudden tragedy, while another part of me observed with detached interest the efforts to rescue the man from the electrified rail. ""Excuse me, please. I am a doctor."" A tall man with a brown beard pushed his way through and knelt beside the lifeless body. A strange feeling of surrealism washed over me as I watched. It felt almost unreal. After a moment, the doctor stood up and grimly declared, ""He's gone. There's nothing more to do."" We all gathered closer, and a distressed porter spoke up.",1
"Beside him lay the empty cup. I quickly went to his side, then hurried out and made my way across the camp to Dr. Ames’s tent. “Dr. Ames!” I shouted. “Hurry.” “What’s wrong?” asked the doctor, emerging in his pajamas. “My friend. He’s sick. Dying. The chamomile tea. Stop Hassan from leaving the camp.” The doctor sprinted to our tent. Poirot was still on the bed. “Incredible,” exclaimed Ames. “Looks like a fit or something he ingested?” He examined the empty cup. “But I didn’t drink it!” a calm voice declared. We spun around in surprise. Poirot was now sitting upright.",1
"""Perhaps it would have been more prudent for her to refrain from writing it, however, I did not express my thoughts on the matter at that point. Following her instructions, you made your way to the curio shop, where you were led through a concealed passage from the rear room and unexpectedly found yourself in the clutches of your adversaries!"" Harry's gaze met mine. I comprehended his unspoken message and cautiously moved closer to Sir Eustace. ""Indeed,"" Sir Eustace whispered, ""you are truly unfortunate! This marks, if I recollect correctly, the third encounter."" ""You are correct,"" Harry acknowledged. ""This is the third encounter. Twice you have outmatched me. Are you aware of the saying that luck changes on the third attempt? This is my turn to take charge, Anne."" I was prepared. In an instant, I swiftly retrieved the pistol from my stocking and aimed it at his head. The two men guarding Harry lunged forward, but his commanding voice halted them in their tracks. ""Another step and he is finished! If they approach any closer, Anne, pull the trigger without hesitation."" ""I won't hesitate,"" I replied cheerfully. ""I must admit, I am somewhat apprehensive about pulling it."" I believe Sir Eustace shared my apprehensions. He was visibly trembling. ""Remain where you are,"" he ordered, and the men complied. ""Instruct them to vacate the premises,"" Harry instructed. Sir Eustace issued the command. The men exited, and Harry secured the door with a bolt. ""Now we can converse,"" he stated grimly, crossing the room to retrieve the revolver from my grip. Sir Eustace sighed in relief and wiped his brow with a handkerchief. ""I am dreadfully out of shape,"" he remarked. ""I suspect I may have a weak heart. I am relieved that the revolver is in capable hands. I did not trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you have pointed out, we can now converse. I am willing to concede that you caught me off guard. Where in the world did that revolver come from? I had the young lady's belongings examined upon her arrival. And how did you produce it just now? You did not have it on you a moment ago."" ""Yes, I did,"" I responded. ""It was concealed in my stocking."" ""I am not well-versed in understanding women. I should have paid more attention to them,"" Sir Eustace lamented. ""I wonder if Pagett would have been aware of that?"" Harry sharply rapped on the table. ""Stop fooling around. If it were not for your gray hair, I would toss you out the window. You despicable scoundrel! Gray hair or not, I"" He took a few steps forward, and Sir Eustace swiftly retreated behind the table. ""The youth are always so impulsive,"" he reproached. ""Incapable of utilizing their intellect, they rely solely on brawn. Let us converse logically. For the time being, you hold the advantage. However, this situation cannot persist. The house is teeming with my men. You are vastly outnumbered. Your temporary superiority was a stroke of luck."" ""Was it?"" There was something in Harry's tone, a sardonic amusement, that caught Sir Eustace's attention. He stared at him. ""Was it?"" Harry repeated. ""Take a seat, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say."" Maintaining his aim with the revolver, he continued, ""The odds are against you this time. First and foremost, listen to that!"" A muffled banging resounded from the lower door. Shouts, curses, and then gunfire followed. Sir Eustace turned pale. ""What is that?"" ""Race and his associates. Did you not realize, Sir Eustace, that Anne and I had an arrangement to verify the authenticity of communications between us? Telegrams were signed 'Andy,' and letters had the word 'and' struck out somewhere within them. Anne was aware that your telegram was fraudulent. She willingly walked into the trap, hoping to ensnare you. Before departing Kimberley, she sent messages to both me and Race. Mrs. Blair has been in contact with us since then. I received the letter composed at your direction, which was precisely as I anticipated. I had previously discussed the likelihood of a hidden passage leading out of the curio shop with Race, and he pinpointed the location of the exit."" There was a screeching, ripping noise, followed by a deafening explosion that shook the room. ""They are bombarding this section of town. I must escort you out of here, Anne."" A bright light illuminated the room as the adjacent house caught fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was pacing back and forth. Harry kept him under surveillance with the revolver. ""Thus, Sir Eustace, you see that the game is up. It was your own inadvertence that provided us with the clue to your whereabouts. Race's men were monitoring the secret passage exit. Despite the precautions you took, they successfully trailed me here."" Sir Eustace abruptly turned. ""Most impressive. Quite commendable. Nevertheless, I have one final statement to make. While I may have lost this round, so have you. You will never be able to pin Nadina's murder on me. I was in Marlow on that day, that is the extent of the evidence against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you were acquainted with her, you had a motive for her demise, and your history speaks volumes. You are a thief, remember, a thief. There is perhaps one thing you are unaware of. I possess the diamonds. And here goes."" With a swift motion, he stooped, raised his arm, and hurled the object through the window, causing a tinkling sound of shattering glass as it disappeared into the inferno across the street. ""There goes your sole opportunity to vindicate your innocence in the Kimberley incident. And now, let us negotiate. You have me cornered. Race will unearth all the evidence he requires in this abode. I stand a chance if I can escape. I am doomed if I remain, but so are you, young man! There is a skylight in the adjoining room. Grant me a moment's head start, and I shall be in the clear. I have made a few arrangements beforehand. Allow me to depart through that route, and I will furnish you with a signed confession admitting to Nadina's murder."" ""Yes, Harry,"" I interjected. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He fixed a stern gaze upon me.",1
"“Do you have another plan up your sleeve? Let me take a wild guess. Are you planning to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s correct. It’s been passed down through the family for generations, but it’s not tied to any inheritance. However, finding a buyer isn’t as simple as it seems. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden dealer, is in search of a potential customer, but time is running out.” Lady Yardly interjected with one more question, “Which plan does she agree with?” “She strongly objects to selling the jewel,” Lord Yardly replied.",1
"""Always twisting the facts to fit the theory! Did Giraud not discover traces of a man and a woman in the shed? How does that align with his case reconstruction? It doesn't, and so we must dismiss them! Is this a methodical approach? The esteemed Giraud! He is merely a self-important balloon. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he looks down upon, will be the pin to burst that balloon."" Hercule Poirot paused, then continued, ""Undoubtedly, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will reveal the truth.""",1
"Despite my concerns for young Willard, the Anubis figure you witnessed last night was actually Hassan disguised at my request. I orchestrated the charade to test the doctor's nerves, but it was clear that he saw through my feigned belief in the supernatural. The performance I put on failed to dupe him. I had a hunch that he would try to target me next. Despite the cursed sea, the oppressive heat, and the sand's irritations, my keen intellect remained sharp. Poirot's instincts were spot on.",1
"“Fear not, my friend,” Poirot reassured me. “Not all can possess the brilliance of Hercule Poirot. That much is clear.” “You truly hold yourself in high regard, more than anyone I've known!” I exclaimed, torn between amusement and irritation. “What can one do? When one is truly unique, one recognizes it! And it seems others agree, including, if I am not mistaken, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “Undoubtedly. She is on her way here.” “How do you know that?” “It’s quite simple. This neighborhood is not high society, my friend! There are no fashionable doctors, no stylish dentists, and certainly no trendy milliners! But there is a fashionable detective. Yes, my friend, it is true. I have become the latest trend, the talk of the town! People say to each other: ‘What? You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must seek out the little Belgian. He is absolutely marvelous! Everyone is going! Hurry!’ And they come! In droves, my friend! With the most trivial of problems!” A bell chimed downstairs. “What did I tell you? That must be Miss Marvell.” As always, Poirot was correct. Shortly after, the American movie star entered, and we stood up to greet her. Mary Marvell was undeniably one of the most beloved actresses in Hollywood. She had recently arrived in England with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage had taken place approximately a year ago in the United States, and this was their first trip to England. They had been warmly welcomed. Everyone was ready to go wild over Mary Marvell, her exquisite wardrobe, her furs, her jewels, particularly one jewel, the magnificent diamond known as “the Western Star,” in honor of its owner. Much had been written, both true and false, about this famous gem, reportedly insured for a staggering fifty thousand pounds. All of this raced through my mind as I joined Poirot in welcoming our elegant client. Miss Marvell was petite and slender, with fair hair and a youthful appearance, complete with innocent blue eyes. Poirot pulled out a chair for her, and she began speaking immediately. “You might think me foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw mentioned to me last night how skillfully you solved the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I simply had to seek your advice. Gregory thinks it’s all a silly joke, but it’s truly troubling me.” She paused briefly. Poirot smiled encouragingly. “Please continue, Madame. You see, I am still in the dark.” “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell opened her handbag and handed three envelopes to Poirot. He examined them closely. “Ordinary paper, the name and address neatly printed. Let’s see what’s inside.” He pulled out the letter. I joined him, looking over his shoulder. The writing was a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.",1
"The gang could easily orchestrate such a simple matter. What use was there in protesting my innocence? Every detail would have been taken care of. Long ago, they had accused Harry Rayburn of stealing from De Beers, and he couldn't prove otherwise. I had no doubt he was innocent. What hope did I have against the ""Colonel's"" scheming? Glancing at the clock, another detail of the case caught my attention. Guy Pagett's watch had a significance that I now understood.",1
"""Sacre bleu!"" Poirot exclaimed. ""That Giraud, always in a rush. I won't have time to organize this drawer properly. Let's hurry."" Hastily, he dumped the contents onto the floor, revealing mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly, Poirot's eyes lit up as he found a small square cardboard - a photograph. After pocketing it, he carelessly stuffed the items back into the drawer. Grabbing my arm, he swiftly led me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hallway, Giraud was standing, observing his suspect. ""Good day, M. Giraud,"" greeted Poirot. ""What do we have here?"" Giraud gestured towards Jack.",1
"""Excellent. Give it some time."" An hour passed before a brightly dressed young woman made her way out. Poirot quietly returned to the apartment, satisfied. ""That's it. First the owners, then the maid. The place should be clear now."" ""What's the plan?"" I inquired nervously. Poirot swiftly headed to the scullery, pulling on the coal-lift rope. ""We're going down incognito, like the dustbins,"" he said with a grin. ""No one will suspect a thing.""",1
"""I can't wait to ditch him in Cape Town,"" she said. ""He's staying?"" ""Yes, he'll have a blast playing detective after Rayburn. It's right up Pagett's alley. He loves a good mystery. But I'm serious about my invitation. Will you join us? Mrs. Blair will be there to chaperone, and you can take breaks to explore."" ""Thank you, Sir Eustace,"" I replied, ""but I think I'm heading to Durban tonight."" ""Don't be stubborn. Remember, there are plenty of lions in Rhodesia. You'll enjoy the lions.""",1
"As he entered the room, a tall young man caught everyone's attention. Mrs. Renauld seemed overjoyed to see him, embracing him with tears in her eyes. The young man, Jack Renauld, explained that his voyage was delayed due to engine trouble. He received a telegram from his father instructing him to travel to South America, a journey he knew little about. Despite claims of a good relationship, Jack admitted to a heated argument with his father before his departure. The tension in the room was palpable as the interrogation continued, with Jack defiantly refusing to disclose the subject of their dispute. The atmosphere was charged with suspicion and uncertainty.",1
"""I understand,"" I whispered softly. ""No words from you could be too harsh, Your Honor."" ""You didn't plan for this woman to be here?"" ""Absolutely not. I bumped into her unexpectedly. She's an English visitor in Merlinville, though I didn't know that until we crossed paths."" ""Hmm,"" the judge responded, his tone mellowing. ""It was against the rules, but I assume the lady is youthful and attractive, isn't she? Ah, to be young! O youth, youth!"" he sighed wistfully. The inspector, less sentimental and more pragmatic, asked, ""But didn't you shut and lock the door when you left?""",1
"Unbeknownst to me, I found a twisted satisfaction in witnessing her collapse. It revealed a vulnerability that I had failed to see before. She was, after all, just a young girl, her actions driven by thoughtless curiosity. ""I did try to warn you,"" I spoke softly. ""I suppose you did. Farewell."" ""Wait, you can't venture out alone in this state. It's too dangerous. I must escort you back to Merlinville."" ""Don't be absurd. I'm perfectly fine now."" ""What if you fall ill again? No, I will not let you go alone."" She fiercely argued against my proposition, her determination shining through.",1
"Poirot and I sat on the grassy knoll facing the sea, reviewing the case of Jack Renauld. I pondered over the details, considering Madame Daubreuil's connection to the Beroldy Case. Suddenly, a thought struck me - Georges Conneau. Poirot was impressed by my revelation, encouraging me to continue. We assumed Conneau was alive and had a vendetta against Renauld, leading to a fatal encounter. Madame Daubreuil's involvement and a cover-up scheme unfolded in my theory. Poirot, however, pointed out the unrealistic aspects of my reconstruction, suggesting it belonged in the movies. I defended my theory, but Poirot's skepticism lingered.",1
"No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her and your record’s against you. You’re a thief, remember, a thief. There’s one thing you don’t know, perhaps. I’ve got the diamonds. And here goes” With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite. “There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we’ll talk. I’ll drive a bargain with you. You’ve got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. There’s a chance for me if I can get away. I’m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man! There’s a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes’ start and I shall be all right. I’ve got one or two little arrangements all ready made. You let me out that way, and give me a start and I leave you a signed confession that I killed Nadina.” “Yes, Harry,” I cried. “Yes, yes, yes!” He turned a stern face on me. “No, Anne, a thousand times, no. You don’t know what you’re saying.” “I do. It solves everything.” “I’d never be able to look Race in the face again. I’ll take my chance, but I’m damned if I’ll let this slippery old fox get away. It’s no good, Anne. I won’t do it.” Sir Eustace chuckled. He accepted defeat without the least emotion. “Well, well,” he remarked. “You seem to have met your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.” There was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to enter the room. His face lit at the sight of us. “You’re safe, Anne. I was afraid” He turned to Sir Eustace. “I’ve been after you for a long time, Pedler and at last I’ve got you.” “Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,” declared Sir Eustace airily. “These young people have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things. I don’t know what it’s all about.” “Don’t you? It means that I’ve found the ‘Colonel.’ It means that on January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It means that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned to do away with her and at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you.” “Indeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information? From the man who is even now being looked for by the police? His evidence will be very valuable.” “We have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.” Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks alias the Rev. Edward Chichester alias Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: “I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me. He persuaded me to come over to his side.” Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. “Rats always leaving a sinking ship,” observed Sir Eustace. “I don’t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they’re in the big giraffe’s stomach. Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn’t rattle, and plugged it up again.” Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: “I always did hate that blinking giraffe,” he said. “It must have been instinct.” We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue. All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me little better than a limp rag. I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious of some barrier between us a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing. I came out on to the stoep early on the following morning and looked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer’s wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the stoep_, a book in my hand which I did not read. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It was not until he said “Good morning, Anne,” that I became aware of his presence. “Oh,” I said, with a flush, “it’s you.” “Yes. May I sit down?” He drew a chair up beside me. It was the first time we had been alone together since that day at the Matoppos. As always, I felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never failed to inspire in me. “What is the news?” I asked. “Smuts will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I give this outbreak three days more before it collapses utterly. In the meantime the fighting goes on.” “I wish,” I said, “that one could be sure that the right people were the ones to get killed. I mean the ones who wanted to fight not just all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the fighting is going on.” He nodded. “I know what you mean, Anne. That’s the unfairness of war. But I’ve other news for you.” “Yes?” “A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to escape.” ""What?"" ""Yes. No one knows how he managed it. He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo’burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn’t seen him this morning. “You understand, don’t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.” He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. “I understand,” I said gratefully. “And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.” “No, of course not.” “You know his real name?” The question surprised me. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar. “Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?” “Of course I remember.” “I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.” “Was that what you meant?” “Of course.” I hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained. He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: “When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted me. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing. But youth’s call to youth. I’ve still got my work.” I was silent. I suppose one can’t really love two men at once but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I looked up at him suddenly. “I think that you’ll go very far,” I said dreamily. “I think that you’ve got a great career ahead of you. You’ll be one of the world’s big men.” I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. “I shall be alone, though.” “All the people who do really big things are.” “You think so?” “I’m sure of it.” He took my hand and said in a low voice: “I’d rather have had the other.” Then Harry came striding round the corner of the house. Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War. This is John Harold Eardsley.” With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry’s voice recalled me to myself. “Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.” He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away. “Why did you deceive me?” “I don’t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that sort of thing the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself for the man I was without ornaments and trappings.” “You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. “How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered. “But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.” “And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep. I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter.",1

"""I can never shake off the guilt of his death. It will be a burden I carry forever!"" ""No, no,"" I reassured. ""It's chilling to think that Bella was the one who took my father's life,"" Jack continued, ""but I had wronged her. When I crossed paths with Marthe, and saw my error, I should have reached out and admitted my fault. Yet, the fear of confrontation, and the worry of Marthe misconstruing the situation, held me back.

"I couldn't help but wonder what he was searching for in that place. There was a hint of worry in his question, which made me stand taller. ""I cannot disclose that information,"" I replied calmly. Giraud fixed me with a sharp stare. ""He's smart enough not to confide in you,"" he said bluntly before abruptly leaving. It seemed that I was not welcome at the Villa Geneviève. Jack Renauld seemed to share the sentiment. I decided to head back to town, take a relaxing bath, and return to the hotel.",1
"I had encountered many individuals in my time, some I had found intriguing, while others left me indifferent. However, none had quite the same air as Mr. Chichester. As I pondered this, Sir Eustace Pedler walked past us on the deck. As he reached Mr. Chichester, he bent down to retrieve a fallen piece of paper, casually handing it back with the simple words, ""You've dropped something."" Without a second glance, Sir Eustace continued on his way, seemingly unaware of the effect his actions had on Mr. Chichester. But I noticed. The sight of that paper seemed to stir something deep within him, his face paling as he balled it up in his hand.",1

"Poirot glanced up at the staircase as he passed by, a look of dissatisfaction on his face. ""It's simply unbelievable that the servants didn't hear anything. The noise from three people coming down those stairs would have been enough to wake the dead!"" ""But it was the dead of night, they were fast asleep by then."" Despite this explanation, Poirot continued to shake his head, clearly not convinced. As he stopped to gaze at the house from the drive, he questioned, ""What made them think to check if the front door was unlocked in the first place? The odds of it being open were slim. It would have been much more logical for them to attempt to break in through a window.""",1
"I detest the idea of being hungry, though I am not concerned for my safety. Smuts will handle the revolution capably. But oh, how I long for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will remember to bring a bottle of whisky when he comes tomorrow? I threw on my hat and headed out, planning to purchase a few souvenirs. The curio shops in Jo’burg are quite charming. While examining a window full of luxurious karosses, a man exiting the shop bumped into me. To my surprise, it was Race. He didn't seem pleased to see me, but I insisted he accompany me back to the hotel. I tire of only having Miss Pettigrew to converse with. ""I had no clue you were in Jo’burg,"" I said conversationally. ""When did you arrive?""",1
"Lady Yardly was ushered into the room, her dark, flashing eyes betraying her concern. She acknowledged that she, too, had received mysterious letters regarding the diamond, with a hint of Eastern influence. Unfortunately, the letters had been destroyed, leaving them with no further clues. Lady Yardly decided to leave, entrusting Captain Hastings with the information to relay to Poirot. When Poirot returned, he seemed intrigued by the developments and decided to involve Lord Yardly in the investigation. Despite some initial reservations, Poirot was determined to solve the case and protect the family diamond. Lord Yardly, a cheerful and somewhat simple man, was puzzled by the situation, seeking answers from Poirot.",1
"""I was well aware of the terms of my father's will,"" the young man confirmed. ""Half of his fortune was left to me, while the other half was put in trust for my mother until her passing."" The magistrate instructed him to continue his narrative. The young man described a heated argument with someone, culminating in a realization that he was in danger of missing his train to Paris. In a rush, he made it to the station and boarded the train, his anger eventually subsiding. He later wrote a letter to Marthe, detailing the confrontation, and found solace in her reassuring response. She reminded him to stay resolute, as any obstacles would eventually crumble under their determination.",1
"“Allow me to maintain my little secret. Please give Lady Yardly my deepest respects and inform her of my delight in returning her jewel. Lovely weather today, isn't it? Good day, my lord."" With a smile, the peculiar man escorted the confused nobleman to the door. Returning, he rubbed his hands gently. ""Poirot,"" I inquired. ""Am I losing my mind?"" ""No, my friend, just lost in thought as usual."" ""How did you obtain the diamond?"" ""From Mr. Rolf."" ""Rolf?"" ""Yes! The threatening letters, the Chinaman, the Society Gossip article - all creations of Mr. Rolf's clever mind! The two identical diamonds? Pure fiction.""",1
"""I suspected someone was approaching from behind, but I couldn't confirm it. They wouldn't have been as close as I was,"" I told the investigator. Mr. Flemming, who accompanied me to the inquest, seemed anxious about my well-being, unaware of my composed facade. The victim, identified as L. B. Carton, had only a house-agent's order in his pockets to view a property near Marlow on the river. The document bore the name L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel.",1
"""The crime must have taken place approximately two hours later, giving anyone who left on that train a solid alibi!"" ""Brilliant, Hastings! You've got it!"" I jumped to my feet. ""We need to check with the station. They surely couldn't have missed two strangers leaving on that train! Let's go immediately!"" ""Do you really think so, Hastings?"" ""Absolutely. We should head there right now."" Poirot gently held me back with a touch on my arm. ""Go ahead if you must, my friend, but if you do, I wouldn't bother asking about those two strangers.""",1
"He was a villain indeed, but his charm was undeniable. I kept my true feelings hidden, aware that Colonel Race had a different perspective. Despite the escape being expected, I doubted they would catch him. I maintained a lukewarm response, and the conversation faltered until Colonel Race inquired about Harry. I informed him of Harry's absence and his clearance of suspicion. Then, Colonel Race dropped a bombshell, revealing Harry's true identity as John Harold Eardsley. My mind raced, questioning everything Harry had told me. His deception was finally exposed, leaving me torn between forgiveness and betrayal.",1
"I waited anxiously, but no one appeared. There was no sign of being trailed. I proceeded toward the open space, counting my steps. After six paces, I halted abruptly. A noise came from behind me, not from anyone tailing me, but from someone already present, lurking. Suddenly, a feeling of impending danger washed over me, an instinctual alarm similar to what I experienced on the Kilmorden that fateful evening. I quickly glanced back, only to be met with silence. Continuing forward, the rustle sounded once more. Persisting on my path, I glanced back again.",1
"""It's undeniable that the letters arrived via post, yet there's a peculiar scent lingering on them, reminiscent of joss-sticks that immediately evoked the East in my mind. What could be the significance of it all?"" I pondered. My companion shook his head in bewilderment. ""That is precisely what we need to uncover. Do you still have the letters in your possession? Perhaps the postmarks hold a clue."" His response was disheartening. ""Regrettably, I disposed of them. You see, back then I perceived it as a mere jest. Is it conceivable that a Chinese syndicate is genuinely pursuing the diamonds? It sounds preposterous."" Despite our efforts, we found ourselves at an impasse, unable to progress any further in unraveling the enigma.",1
"Poirot. My fondness for jewelry is well known. Ed always surprises me with a new piece whenever things are going smoothly. Do you have an interest in gemstones?” “I have had my fair share of experiences with them, madame. My line of work has led me to encounter some of the most renowned jewels in the world.” He proceeded to recount, using discreet aliases, the tale of the legendary jewels of a royal family, capturing Mrs. Opalsen's undivided attention. “Oh my!” she gasped, after he finished. “It's just like a scene from a play! You know, I possess some pearls with a fascinating backstory attached to them.",1
"""The chauffeur, surprised by the attack, slammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister leaned out of the window. Without warning, two shots were fired. The first one barely missed his cheek, the second, thankfully, missed altogether. The chauffeur, understanding the peril, quickly sped forward, dispersing the group of assailants.""""A close call,"" I exclaimed, feeling a chill. ""Mr. MacAdam brushed off the minor injury he sustained. He insisted it was just a superficial cut.""",1
"Poirot was examining the crime scene thoroughly, his attention caught by a piece of discoloured lead-piping near the spade. Giraud, the Paris detective, seemed uninterested and continued his search. Poirot, however, was intrigued and found it very interesting. M. Bex, impressed by Poirot's quick understanding of the situation, praised him highly. The detective's efficiency was undeniable, even though I harbored a dislike for him. Poirot's focus on seemingly insignificant details puzzled me, but he seemed determined to uncover the truth.",1
"“Can you recall the topics of conversation during Tuesday night's dinner?” Poirot inquired. “Well, we touched on various odd subjects. Maltravers inquired about my family, then we delved into the issue of German reparations. Mrs. Maltravers had many queries about East Africa, to which I shared a couple of anecdotes,” the witness replied. Poirot paused briefly before proposing, “May I conduct a small experiment with your consent? You have divulged all that your conscious mind is aware of, now I wish to probe your subconscious thoughts.”",1
"He concealed his thoughts so cleverly behind those impenetrable dark eyes. He unnerved me a bit. He had always unnerved me. I never could figure him out. We silently ascended until we arrived at the location where Rhodes is protected by massive rocks. A peculiar, eerie location, far from civilization, that sings an endless song of rugged magnificence. We lingered there for a while in quietude. Then descended once again, but veering slightly from the trail. At times it was a difficult climb and at one point we encountered a steep incline or cliff that was nearly vertical. Colonel Race led the way, then offered a hand to assist me.",1
"""I was in the neighborhood, yes. Sir Eustace has not already told you? I hoped he had not recognized me, but from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is only too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, with an abnormal sense of humor. It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts.""",1
"""Poor chap is still recovering."" ""Severe bronchitis can really knock a man down,"" Mr. Shaw admitted sadly. ""But I fear Mr. Vavasour may have been overwhelmed by my absence, especially with this unexpected problem arising."" Poirot probed further with his questions, trying to assess the relationship between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour's responses were short and formal. His nephew, a reliable bank employee, had no financial troubles or debts that he was aware of. He had handled similar tasks before.",1
"""I chuckled. Everyone mocks that giraffe. ""And giraffes. They were wanderers, you see. It wasn't until they settled in communities, with women doing one thing and men another, that women became weak. And deep down, one remains the same, feels the same, I mean, and that's why women idolize physical strength in men - it's what they once had and have lost."" ""Almost like ancestor worship, isn't it?"" ""Something along those lines."" ""And do you truly believe that? That women admire strength, I mean?"" ""I believe it's quite true if we're honest. You may think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to a primitive state where the physical is all that matters. However, I don't think that's the end. If you lived in primitive conditions, it would be fine, but you don't, so in the end, the other aspect prevails. It's the things that seem defeated that always triumph, isn't it? They triumph in the only way that matters. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it."" ""In the end,"" Colonel Race mused, ""you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you're saying?"" ""Not exactly, but you can interpret it that way if you wish."" ""But you've never fallen out of love, Miss Anne, have you?"" ""No, I haven't,"" I confessed honestly. ""Or fallen in love, for that matter?"" I remained silent. The car pulled up at our destination and the conversation ended. We exited and began the gradual climb to the World's View. Once again, I felt a slight unease in Colonel Race's presence. He concealed his thoughts so effectively behind those impenetrable black eyes. He intimidated me somewhat. He had always intimidated me. I never knew where I stood with him. We ascended in silence until we reached the spot where Rhodes is entombed by enormous boulders. A peculiar, eerie place, far from human activity, that sang a never-ending hymn of rugged beauty. We sat there in silence for a while. Eventually, we descended, deviating slightly from the path. At times it was a challenging scramble, and once we encountered a steep slope or rock that was almost vertical. Colonel Race led the way, then turned to assist me. ""Better lift you,"" he suddenly remarked, and swiftly lifted me off my feet with a deft movement. I felt his strength as he placed me down and released his grip. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And once again, I felt apprehensive, particularly as he didn't step aside, but instead stood directly in front of me, gazing into my eyes. ""What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?"" he asked abruptly. ""I'm a wanderer exploring the world."" ""Yes, that's accurate. The newspaper correspondent is just a cover. You don't possess the soul of a journalist. You're seizing life for yourself. But that's not all."" What was he trying to make me reveal? I was frightened. I met his gaze squarely. My eyes may not conceal secrets like his, but they can take the battle to the enemy's territory. ""What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?"" I inquired deliberately. For a moment, I thought he wouldn't respond. He appeared taken aback, however. Eventually, he spoke, and there was a hint of grim amusement in his words. ""Chasing ambition,"" he declared. ""Just that - chasing ambition. You'll recall, Miss Beddingfeld, that 'by that sin fell the angels,' and so on."" ""It is said,"" I said slowly, ""that you are actually linked to the Government, that you are part of the Secret Service. Is that true?"" Was it my imagination, or did he pause for a fraction of a second before replying? ""I assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am here purely as a private individual, traveling for my own enjoyment."" Reflecting on the response later, I found it somewhat ambiguous. Perhaps he intended it to be so. We returned to the car in silence. On the way back to Bulawayo, we halted for tea at a relatively basic structure by the roadside. The owner was busy working in the garden and seemed irritated at being interrupted. Nevertheless, he promised to see what he could provide. After a lengthy wait, he brought us some stale cakes and lukewarm tea. He then returned to his garden. As soon as he left, we were surrounded by cats. Six of them, all meowing pitifully at once. The noise was deafening. I offered them some cake, which they devoured eagerly. I poured all the milk into a saucer, and they fought amongst themselves to lap it up. ""Oh,"" I exclaimed indignantly, ""they're malnourished! It's cruel. Please, order more milk and another plate of cake."" Colonel Race left silently to fulfill my request. The cats resumed meowing. He returned with a large jug of milk, which the cats consumed entirely. I stood up, determination etched on my face. ""I'm taking those cats home with us. I won't leave them here."" ""My dear, don't be ridiculous. You can't carry six cats along with fifty wooden animals."" ""Forget the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I will bring them back with me."" ""You will do no such thing."" I glared at him resentfully, but he continued, ""You may think me heartless, but one cannot go through life being sentimental about such matters. There's no use resisting - I won't permit you to take them. This is a primitive land, you know, and I'm stronger than you."" I always recognize defeat. I descended to the car with tears in my eyes. ""They're probably lacking food just for today,"" he reassured me. ""That man's wife has gone to Bulawayo for supplies. So it will be fine. Besides, you know, the world is full of starving cats."" ""Stop it,"" I said fiercely. ""I'm teaching you to confront life as it is. I'm teaching you to be tough and ruthless like me. That's the key to strength and success.""",1
"""You recall the De Beer jewels?” “Yes, I recall. In Kimberley, just prior to the war? I was not involved, and I never learned the specifics, the incident was kept quiet for some reason, correct? Quite a lucrative heist.” “Valued at a hundred thousand pounds. Two of us executed it as per the ‘Colonel’s’ instructions, naturally. That's when I seized my opportunity. The idea was to swap out some of the De Beer diamonds with sample diamonds carried from South America by two inexperienced miners who were coincidentally in Kimberley at that moment.",1
"""There was just a single diamond, my friend! Originally part of the Yardly collection, it has now been in Mr. Rolf's possession for three years. He managed to steal it this morning using a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! I must say, watching him on the film, he truly is an artist. “But why would he steal his own diamond?” I inquired, feeling confused. “For various reasons. Firstly, Lady Yardly was becoming impatient.” “Lady Yardly?” “You see, she was often left alone in California. Her husband was off having fun elsewhere. Mr. Rolf, on the other hand, was quite attractive and had a hint of romance about him.""",1
"I turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain. To my intense surprise, I heard a light footfall on the deck behind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned. “I want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last night.” “It was a peculiar night,” I said hastily. “Will you forgive me?” I held out my hand without a word. He took it. “There’s something else I want to say.” His gravity deepened. “Miss Beddingfeld, you may not know it, but you are mixed up in a rather dangerous business.” “I gathered as much,” I said. “No, you don’t. You can’t possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave the whole thing alone. It can’t concern you really. Don’t let your curiosity lead you to tamper with other people’s business. No, please don’t get angry again. I’m not speaking of myself. You’ve no idea of what you might come up against these men will stop at nothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you’re in danger look at last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is to persuade them that they’re mistaken. But be careful, always be on the look out for danger, and, look here, if at any time you should fall into their hands, don’t try and be clever tell the whole truth, it will be your only chance.” “You make my flesh creep, Mr. Rayburn,” I said, with some truth. “Why do you take the trouble to warn me?” He did not answer for some minutes, then he said in a low voice: “It may be the last thing I can do for you. Once on shore I shall be all right but I may not get on shore.” “What?” I cried. “You see, I’m afraid you’re not the only person on board who knows that I am ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’” “If you think that I told” I said hotly. He reassured me with a smile. “I don’t doubt you, Miss Beddingfeld. If I ever said I did, I lied. No, but there’s one person on board who’s known all along. He’s only got to speak and my number’s up. All the same, I’m taking a sporting chance that he won’t speak.” “Why?” “Because he’s a man who likes playing a lone hand. And when the police have got me I should be of no further use to him. Free, I might be! Well, an hour will show.” He laughed rather mockingly, but I saw his face harden. If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always.",1
"""I'm not sure."" He then blushed and continued with sudden intensity: ""Why did I say that? I truly loved my father. We exchanged harsh words the last time I saw him, and we argued often about my reckless behavior and debts, but I held affection for the old man. I realize now how much I cared, now that it's too late,"" he added more calmly. ""It was during my time at Cambridge that I encountered the other individual."" ""Young Eardsley?"" ""Indeed, young Eardsley. His father, as you are aware, was a prominent figure in South Africa. We immediately formed a bond, my companion and I.""",1
"“Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me. I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s me Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it. “Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got lots of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar.”",1
"Poirot's brow furrowed in confusion, causing me to lean in and ask softly, ""What's wrong?"" He dismissed my question with a shake of his head and inquired, ""Excuse me, M. Bex, but could M. Renauld have driven the car himself?"" The commissary glanced at Françoise, who quickly responded, ""No, Monsieur did not drive himself."" Poirot's expression darkened. ""I wish you would share your concerns with me,"" I urged. ""Don't you see? In his letter, M. Renauld mentioned sending the car for me in Calais."" ""Maybe he meant a rental car,"" I proposed. ""Probably, but why rent a car when you have your own?""",1
"I decided to rename the car ""Colonel Race and his Entourage"" instead of ""Sir Eustace Pedler and Party."" Mrs. Blair, on the other hand, became fixated on taking absurd photos during our journey. With each treacherous turn and ascent, she insisted on capturing shots of the engine. ""Can you see the thrill?"" she exclaimed with glee. ""It's truly remarkable to photograph the front of the train from the rear, especially with the backdrop of the looming mountains."" I tried to explain that the perspective was indiscernible, but she simply smiled and replied, ""I will caption it: 'Taken from the train.'""",1
"""Mrs. Davenheim is a rather unintelligent woman, a nonentity,"" pondered Poirot. ""Had he any enemies?"" ""Plenty of financial rivals,"" replied Hastings. ""A figure was seen near the rose-garden,"" mentioned Hastings. ""Beyond lies a lake with a boathouse,"" added Hastings. Japp walked in bursting with news. ""We found his clothes, identical to what he wore that day,"" announced Japp. ""Lowen was seen near the study,"" continued Japp. ""Mr. Davenheim's ring was pawned by Billy Kellett,"" Japp explained. ""Kellett saw a man with a big moustache,"" shared Japp.",1
"""As you did not provide me with an address, the letter was sent to me for forwarding,"" he clarified. Poirot examined the letter with interest. The handwriting, a woman's script, was long and slanted. Without opening it, he placed it in his pocket and stood up. ""Until tomorrow, M. le juge. Thank you for your kindness."" ""It is no trouble at all. I am here to assist you. These young detectives, followers of Giraud, they are all impolite and arrogant,"" he remarked.",1
"""And how did you notice that?” The doctor appeared puzzled. Poirot quickly clarified. “It is the curtains I am referring to. They were left undrawn. Quite strange, don't you think? And then there was the coffee. It was extremely dark coffee.” “So what?” “Extremely dark,” Poirot reiterated. “When we consider that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, what do we deduce?” “Nonsense,” chuckled the doctor. “You're joking with me.” “I never joke. Hastings here can attest to that.” “I don’t understand your point, though,” I admitted. “You don’t suspect the butler, do you? He could have been involved, putting something in the coffee. Will they check his alibi?” “Certainly, my friend; but it is Signor Ascanio's alibi that concerns me.” “You believe he has an alibi?” “That is precisely what troubles me. We will soon find out more about that.” The Daily Newsmonger provided us with updates on the unfolding events. Signor Ascanio was taken into custody and accused of the murder of Count Foscatini. Upon his arrest, he denied any acquaintance with the Count and claimed he had not visited Regent’s Court on the night of the crime or the morning prior. The younger man had vanished completely. Signor Ascanio had arrived unaccompanied at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All attempts to locate the second man proved fruitless. Ascanio, however, was not brought to trial. The Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified during the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight to nine that evening. The suspect was released. Many speculated that the crime had political undertones and was being intentionally suppressed. Poirot closely followed these developments. Yet, I was taken aback when he suddenly informed me one morning that he expected a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that visitor happened to be Ascanio himself. “He wants your advice?” “Not at all, Hastings. I wish to consult him.” “About what?” “The murder at Regent’s Court.” “Are you going to prove his guilt?” “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Use your common sense. Ah, that must be our guest at the door.” Soon after, Signor Ascanio entered, a slight, secretive man with wary eyes. He stood, casting suspicious glances around the room. “Monsieur Poirot?” My companion tapped his chest lightly. “Please, have a seat, signor. You received my message. I am determined to unravel this mystery. And I believe you can assist me in some small way. Let's begin. You and a friend visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th.” The Italian reacted angrily. “I did no such thing. I have sworn in court” “Exactly, and I suspect that you have perjured yourself.” “Are you threatening me? Ha! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.""",1
"""I need to inquire, Lady Yardly, about the postmarks on the letters you were sent,"" he asked. Lady Yardly, with a hint of regret, replied, ""I'm sorry, but I can't recall. It never crossed my mind to pay attention to such details."" ""Will you be staying the night?"" Lord Yardly inquired. ""Oh, my lord, I wouldn't want to impose. Our belongings are still at the inn,"" she responded. ""Don't worry about that,"" Lord Yardly quickly interjected. ""We'll have them brought here. It's no trouble at all, I assure you.""",1
"""And that fool Giraud, crawling all over it in search of match ends! Didn't I mention that a clue of two feet long is just as valuable as a clue of two inches?"" ""Giraud will be humbled now,"" I quickly remarked, trying to divert attention from my mistakes. ""As I mentioned earlier, will he? If he has found the correct suspect using the wrong approach, he won't be bothered by that."" ""But of course"" I stopped as I noticed the shift in direction. ""You see, Hastings, we need to begin anew. Who murdered M. """,1
"""And rightly so! Your crime was a horrifying one, condemned by both gods and men!” M. Hautet declared, relishing the opportunity to deliver his speech with gravitas. “You have taken a life, and now you must face the consequences. I do not address you as a mere mortal, but as the embodiment of eternal Justice,” M. Hautet's speech was abruptly cut short. The door swung open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” the attendant stuttered, “there is a woman here who claims, who claims ” “Who claims what?” the magistrate demanded, his patience wearing thin.",1
"""Evidently, he was correct!” With tears welling up, she bid us a composed goodbye. Poirot, walking alongside me, made his usual gesture. “Well, that settles it! Let's return to London, my dear friend, as it seems there is no mystery to solve here. But” “But what?” “Just a small inconsistency, nothing more! Did you catch it? No? Nonetheless, discrepancies are common in life, and certainly the man did not commit suicide, as there is no poison that would result in blood in his mouth.""",1
"""The discussion that Foscatini was going to have with these gentlemen seemed very unusual,"" Graves explained. The murder took place at 8:47, indicated by a clock that had stopped at that exact time. The victim's face was described in detail, revealing his olive complexion and distinctive features. Inspector concluded that the case was straightforward, with Signor Ascanio as the main suspect. Ascanio's alibi was later confirmed by the Italian Ambassador, leading to his release. Poirot, however, was not convinced and decided to confront Ascanio about his involvement in the murder. Ascanio, feeling threatened by Poirot, eventually confessed to visiting Foscatini on the morning of the murder.",1
"“Even Hercule Poirot couldn't solve this one,” my friend chuckled. “I'm going to start the investigation now. Just had to make my case to you first. But mark my words, I'll be proven right; and once I've given Japp a heads up, he'll have enough to nab the upstanding Mr. Graves. I'm curious how much of the money he's already blown through.” Poirot's intuition was spot on, as always, curse him! The case brought to us by Miss Violet Marsh was a welcome departure from our usual mundane tasks. Poirot had received a concise and professional note from the woman requesting a meeting, to which he responded by setting up an appointment for eleven o'clock the next morning.",1
"""You've spent quite some time in South America, haven't you, M. Renauld?"" ""I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen."" ""You served in the English Flying Corps, correct?"" ""Yes, M. le juge."" M. Hautet nodded, and continued his questioning along the familiar lines. Jack Renauld stated that he had no knowledge of any enemies his father might have had in Santiago or elsewhere in South America, that he had noticed no recent change in his father's behavior, and that he had never heard him mention a secret. He believed the trip to South America was related to business matters. As M. Hautet paused, Giraud interjected. ""I would like to ask a few questions of my own, M. le juge."" ""Certainly, M. Giraud, go ahead,"" said the magistrate coolly. Giraud moved closer to the table. ""Were you and your father on good terms, M. Renauld?"" ""Absolutely,"" replied the young man haughtily. ""You are certain of that?"" ""Yes."" ""No disagreements at all?"" Jack shrugged. ""Everyone has differing opinions now and then."" ""Indeed. But if someone were to claim that you had a heated argument with your father before leaving for Paris, that person would be lying, correct?"" I couldn't help but admire Giraud's cleverness. His claim of knowing everything was proven true. Jack Renauld seemed unsettled by the question. ""We did have a disagreement,"" he confessed. ""Ah, a disagreement! During that disagreement, did you utter the words: 'When you are dead, I can do as I please'?"" ""I might have,"" muttered the young man. ""I'm not sure."" ""In response, did your father say: 'But I am not dead yet!' And did you reply: 'I wish you were!'?"" Jack remained silent. His hands nervously played with the objects on the table in front of him. ""I must insist on an answer, please, M. Renauld,"" Giraud said sharply. With a frustrated sigh, Jack knocked a heavy paper-knife to the floor. ""What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did argue with my father. I probably said all those things I was so angry I can't even recall what I said! I was furious I could have almost killed him at that moment there, use that against me!"" He leaned back in his chair, flushed and defiant. Giraud smiled, then, moving his chair back slightly, said: ""That will be all. Would you like to continue, M. le juge?"" ""Ah, yes, exactly,"" said M. Hautet. ""And what was the nature of your disagreement?"" ""I refuse to disclose that."" M. Hautet sat up in his chair. ""M. Renauld, do not play games with the law!"" he thundered.",1
"In the cases I have documented, Poirot's inquiries typically begin with a key fact, whether it be murder or theft, and advance from there through a series of logical deductions to the ultimate successful resolution. However, the incidents I am going to recount next were set in motion by a peculiar sequence of events that unfolded from seemingly insignificant occurrences that initially caught Poirot's eye to the dark events that concluded a highly unusual case.",1
"""Can't you provide any more information about him?"" he asked, as I prepared to leave. ""Actually,"" I replied. I took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a final blow. ""His head was notably brachycephalic. He won't be able to change that easily."" I was pleased to see Inspector Meadow's pen hesitate. It was obvious he was unsure how to spell brachycephalic. Fueled by anger, my next move surprisingly felt effortless. I had a vague plan in mind when I entered Scotland Yard.",1
"""The commissary paused. “And the residents of the mansion, sir?” “There's elderly Françoise, the head housekeeper, who served the previous owners of Villa Geneviève for many years. Next, we have two young sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. They hail from Merlinville and belong to esteemed families. The chauffeur, brought by Mr. Renauld from England, is currently on vacation. Lastly, we have Madame Renauld and her son, Mr. Jack Renauld. Unfortunately, Mr. Jack Renauld is also out of town.” Poirot nodded in acknowledgment. M.""",1
"""He frequently travels back and forth to Africa. It is rumored that he is involved in undercover operations, although the truth remains uncertain. He carries an air of mystery about him."" ""Perhaps he inherited a substantial fortune from Sir Laurence Eardsley?"" ""Ah, he must be quite wealthy. He would make a suitable match for you."" ""I can't pursue him while you're here,"" I joked. ""Ah, the complications of married women!"" ""We certainly have an advantage,"" Suzanne said smugly. ""Everyone knows my loyalty lies with my husband, Clarence. It's much safer and more enjoyable to court a devoted wife.""",1
"I will not take long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “Another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can help her.” In a moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart skipped a beat as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had appeared too often in the Society papers to remain unknown. “Please, Lady Yardly, take a seat,” I said, pulling forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but he will be back very soon.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. Leaning forward on a sudden impulse, I said, “Lady Yardly, I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.” My words hit home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all color drained from her cheeks. “You know?” she gasped. “How?” I smiled. “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters” “Miss Marvell? She has been here?” “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?” After a moment of hesitation, she bowed her head in assent with a little smile. “That is so,” she acknowledged. “Were yours, too, left by hand by a Chinaman?” “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?” I recounted the events of the morning to her. She listened attentively. “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them something in the nature of joss-stick that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?” I shook my head. “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.” “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.” We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose. “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.” She hesitated, her hand outstretched. “Captain Hastings.” “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.” When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent. I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend. “Bien!” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves. “Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly 10th viscount, served South African War’ tout ça n’a pas d’importance ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ um, um, um, ‘has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. Clubs residences.’ Voilà, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this milord!” “What?” “Yes. I telegraphed to him.” “I thought you had washed your hands of the case?” “I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.” “And you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience. He won’t be pleased.” “Au contraire, if I preserve for him his family diamond, he ought to be very grateful.” “Then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?” I asked eagerly. “Almost a certainty,” replied Poirot placidly. “Everything points that way.” “But how” Poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand. “Not now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that ‘Peerage’ how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, method, which, as I have often told you, Hastings” “Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place. Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality. “Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too. What does it all mean?” Poirot handed him the copy of Society Gossip.",1
"“I can see that your story is quite coherent, but there’s still one thing that eludes me. Where have the diamonds gone?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I responded, observing him closely. His expression remained unchanged, still radiating a sly sense of humor. “Ah. I desire those diamonds.” “I doubt you’ll have much luck retrieving them,” I retorted. “Is that so? Well, now I do. I hate to be unpleasant, but consider this: a few dead bodies found in this area of the city wouldn’t be a shock. There’s a man downstairs who specializes in that sort of work. Now, you’re a smart young lady. Here’s my proposal: you will sit down and pen a letter to Harry Rayburn, instructing him to come here and bring the diamonds” “I refuse to comply.” “Let your elders finish speaking. I suggest we make a deal. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t underestimate it, your life is completely in my hands.” “And Harry?” “I’m too kind-hearted to separate young lovers. He will be free as well, as long as neither of you interferes with me in the future.” “How can I trust that you’ll uphold your end of the deal?” “You can’t, my dear. You’ll have to trust me and hope for the best. But if you’re feeling heroic and prefer destruction, that’s another story.” This was the moment I had been waiting for. I didn’t rush to take the bait. Slowly, I allowed myself to be persuaded and coerced into giving in. Under Sir Eustace’s guidance, I wrote: Dear Harry, I believe I have a way to prove your innocence beyond doubt. Follow these instructions precisely. Visit Agrasato’s curio-shop. Request to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” You will then be led to the back room. A messenger there will bring you to me. Follow his lead and bring the diamonds. Keep this a secret. Sir Eustace paused. “I’ll leave the personal touches to you,” he said. “Just be cautious not to make any errors.” “‘Yours for eternity, Anne,’ will suffice,” I suggested. I penned down the words. Sir Eustace reached for the letter and read it over. “Looks good. Now, the address.” I provided it. It belonged to a small shop that handled letters and telegrams for a fee. He rang the bell on the table. Chichester-Pettigrew, also known as Minks, responded. “This letter should be sent through the usual channels immediately.” “Understood, Colonel.” He glanced at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace observed him closely. “A friend of yours, I presume?” “A friend?” The man appeared taken aback. “Someone questioned me about your and Colonel Race’s movements in Johannesburg yesterday. I misled him.” “Splendid, my good man, splendid,” Sir Eustace praised. “My error.” As Chichester-Pettigrew exited the room, I caught a glimpse of his expression.",1
"“What do you suggest we do with this pile of rubbish? Toss it into the river?” he inquired nonchalantly. “If that’s your preference,” I replied calmly. “I must say, Miss Beddingfeld, I do appreciate your unabashed, ruthless instincts. But we shall allow him to recuperate at his own pace. His injuries are not severe.” “You appear to balk at the idea of a second murder,” I remarked sweetly. “A second murder?” He appeared genuinely confused. “The woman in Marlow,” I reminded him, studying his reaction intently. A dark, brooding look clouded his face. It was as though he had forgotten I was there. “I may have been responsible for her death,” he confessed. “At times, I wonder if I had intended to harm her.",1
"She was standing there with her eyes cast down, a faint enigmatic smile on her lips, filling me with a sense of fear, like one might feel towards a beautiful but deadly snake. Poirot, always polite, inquired about M. Stonor and Mrs. Renauld, to which Madame Daubreuil responded calmly. As we made our way to the Villa Geneviève, Poirot kept a watchful eye on the lighted window. Suddenly, a cry for help shattered the silence, prompting Poirot to take swift action. With Cinderella's acrobatic skills, a dangerous rescue mission unfolded. The tension mounted as the true identity of the murderer was revealed, leaving us all in shock. The night was filled with chaos and danger, but in the end, justice prevailed.",1
"""No, not there. I remember tossing it into the bunk's side rack,"" she said, handing it to me. It was a typical round tin cylinder used for packing films in tropical areas. As I took it, my heart skipped a beat - it was heavier than expected. I carefully removed the adhesive strip and opened the lid, revealing a cascade of dull glassy pebbles. ""Pebbles,"" I sighed, disappointed. ""Pebbles?"" Suzanne exclaimed with excitement. ""No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!"" Diamonds! I stared at the glassy heap on the bunk, picking up a piece that resembled a broken bottle fragment in weight. ""Are you sure, Suzanne?"" ""Absolutely, my dear. I've seen rough diamonds before, no doubt about it. They're stunning, Anne, some of them are truly unique. There's a story behind these."" ""The story from tonight,"" I realized. ""You think?"" ""Colonel Race's narrative. It can't be a coincidence. He had a purpose."" ""To test the effect, you mean?"" I nodded. ""On Sir Eustace?"" ""Yes."" But a doubt crept in. Was Sir Eustace the target of the test, or was it meant for me? I recalled feeling ""pumped"" by Colonel Race before. Why was he suspicious? What was his connection to all this? ""Who is Colonel Race?"" I asked. ""That's a tough question,"" Suzanne replied. ""Known for big-game hunting, distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. Never met him until now. Rumors of Secret Service work, mystery surrounds him."" ""Inherits a lot from Sir Laurence Eardsley?"" ""Must be wealthy. Perfect match for you."" ""Can't pursue him with you around,"" I chuckled. ""Oh, married women!"" ""We have an advantage,"" Suzanne said smugly. ""Clarence, my husband, adores me. Safe and pleasant for him to love a devoted wife."" ""Must be nice for Clarence,"" I remarked. ""But what about Colonel Race? He's involved."" ""Not a random story he told,"" I agreed. ""He was watching us closely. Some diamonds are still missing. Perhaps these are the ones or maybe..."" ""Maybe what?"" I hesitated. ""Curious about the other man, Lucas. Not Eardsley but Lucas."" ""Getting some clarity. Diamonds are the motive. 'The Man in the Brown Suit' killed Nadina for them."" ""He didn't kill her,"" I insisted. ""He did. Who else could it be?"" ""I'm not sure. But he didn't do it."" ""He entered the house after her and came out shocked,"" Suzanne argued. ""Maybe the murderer was already there or found another way in. No need to pass the lodge."" Suzanne's eyes narrowed. ""Who was 'The Man in the Brown Suit'? Identical to the 'doctor' in the Tube. Carton didn't know he was being followed. When he realized, it was too late. He met the same fate. Clear, right?"" I remained silent. ""That's the gist. He took the paper, followed the woman to Marlow. What happened next, after her death or discovery?"" Still, I stayed quiet. ""Did he convince Sir Eustace to bring him as secretary? A chance to flee England safely. But how did he persuade Sir Eustace? Seems like he has leverage."" ""Or over Pagett,"" I added. ""You're not fond of Pagett. Sir Eustace praises him.""",1
"His account matched that of Miss Farquhar in every detail. After he had finished speaking, Poirot picked up the conversation with a query. ""What specifically prompted you to realize that the bonds had been taken, Mr. Ridgeway?"" He chuckled bitterly. ""The evidence was right in front of me, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn't have overlooked it. My cabin trunk was partially pulled out from under the bunk, with visible scratches and cuts where the thieves attempted to break the lock."" ""Yet I was under the impression that it was opened with a key?"" ""Indeed. They attempted to force it, but to no avail.""",1
"""It wasn’t merely the monetary worth of the discovery that captivated them, Eardsley had wealth in his future and Lucas was accustomed to poverty. Rather, it was the pure joy of finding something new.” There was a brief silence before he continued, almost hesitantly: “I hope you don’t object to me recounting the story in this manner, almost as if I wasn’t a part of it. That’s how it feels now, reflecting on those two youngsters. It’s easy to overlook the fact that one of them happened to be Harry Rayburn.""",1
"""We won't be needing it at the moment."" ""But what if he tries to run away?"" Poirot chuckled. ""He won't."" I quickly fetched the taxi that was waiting. The stranger's scarf was removed from his face, and I was taken aback. ""He's not Japanese,"" I whispered to Poirot. ""You always had a keen eye for observation, Hastings! You don't miss a thing. No, he's not Japanese. He's Italian."" We entered the taxi, and Poirot instructed the driver to go to an address in St. John's Wood. I was now thoroughly puzzled.",1
"Anne Beddingfeld was relentless in her pursuit of the criminal, determined to claim the glory of his discovery for herself and the Daily Budget. Despite my warnings about the unwomanly nature of her actions, she laughed them off, certain that capturing him would secure her fortune. Even Race seemed uneasy, and I couldn't help but wonder if Rayburn was among us on the train. The thought crossed my mind that we might all meet a grim fate in our sleep. Mrs. agreed with my concerns.",1
"""The color drained from my face, but Poirot's expression remained unchanged. He raised an eyebrow. 'A cigarette butt, and a match,' he remarked. 'And what do you make of that?' Poirot gestured with his hands. 'It tells me nothing.' 'Ah!' Giraud interjected, with a smug tone. 'You clearly haven't studied these matters. That's no ordinary match, at least not in this region. It's quite common in South America. Luckily, it's unused. Otherwise, I might not have identified it. It appears that one of the men discarded his cigarette butt, and used another match from the box to light a new one.' 'And the other match?' inquired Poirot. 'What about the match he used to light his cigarette? Have you found that as well?' 'No.' 'Perhaps you didn't search thoroughly.' 'Not thoroughly search.' The detective seemed on the verge of losing his temper for a moment, but managed to compose himself. 'I see you enjoy a jest, M. Poirot. But regardless, match or no match, the cigarette butt is telling. It's a South American cigarette with licorice-flavored paper.' Poirot nodded. The commissary interjected, 'The cigarette butt and match could have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it has only been two years since he returned from South America.' 'No,' Giraud confidently responded. 'I have already checked among M. Renauld's belongings. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are different.' 'Do you not find it strange,' Poirot questioned, 'that these strangers arrived without a weapon, gloves, or a shovel, and yet conveniently found all these items?' Giraud smirked with a sense of superiority. 'Indeed, it is odd. Without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.' 'Aha!' M. Hautet exclaimed. 'An accomplice. An accomplice within the residence!' 'Or outside,' Giraud added with a sly smile. 'But someone must have let them in, right? We cannot imagine that, through pure luck, they found the door open for them to enter.' 'Agreed, M. Judge. The door was opened for them, but it could have been done from outside by someone with a key.' 'But who had a key?' Giraud shrugged. 'No one with a key would readily admit it. But several individuals could have had access. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for example. Despite his journey to South America, he might have lost or had his key stolen. Then there's the long-serving gardener. A young servant could have a lover. It's simple to make a key impression and have one copied. There are many possibilities. However, there is one person who seems most likely to possess such a key.' 'Who might that be?' 'Madame Daubreuil,' the detective dryly replied. 'Eh, eh!' M. Hautet's expression fell slightly. 'So you're aware of that, are you?' 'I'm aware of everything,' Giraud coolly stated.""",1
"I never even spoke to the woman. But you? You had a reason to kill her and your past doesn't help your case. You're a thief, remember that. But here's the thing you don't know. I have the diamonds. Watch this."" In one swift motion, he stooped, raised his arm, and threw. The sound of shattering glass echoed as the object flew through the window into the fiery mass outside. ""There goes your chance to prove your innocence in the Kimberley case. Now, let's talk. I have a proposition for you. I'm trapped here. Race will find what he needs in this house. If I can escape, I might have a chance. If I stay, we're both doomed, young man! There's a skylight in the next room. Give me a head start, and I'll leave you a signed confession admitting I killed Nadina."" ""Yes, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He gave me a stern look. ""No, Anne, never. You don't know what you're saying."" ""I do. It solves everything."" ""I can't face Race if I do that. I'll take my chances, but I won't let this sly old fox get away. It's no use, Anne. I won't do it."" Sir Eustace chuckled, accepting his defeat calmly. ""You've met your match, Anne. Moral righteousness doesn't always win."" Footsteps thundered up the stairs as Harry unlocked the door. Colonel Race burst into the room, relieved to see us. ""You're safe, Anne. I was worried,"" he said, turning to Sir Eustace. ""I've been chasing you for a while, Pedler, and now I've caught you."" ""Everyone seems to be losing their minds,"" Sir Eustace remarked casually. ""These young ones threatened me with guns and accused me of all sorts of things. I have no idea what's going on."" ""Don't you? It means I've found the 'Colonel.' It means on January 8th, you were in Marlow, not Cannes. It means you planned to eliminate Nadina when she turned on you, and now we can finally pin the crime on you,"" Colonel Race explained. ""Really? And who told you all this? The man the police are still looking for? His testimony should be valuable."" ""We have other evidence. Someone else knew Nadina was meeting you at the Mill House,"" Colonel Race added, gesturing for Arthur Minks to step forward. ""I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went to England. She told me of her plans. I warned her about you, but she didn't listen. I read a wireless message on the table and decided to go after the diamonds myself. Mr. Rayburn convinced me to switch sides in Johannesburg,"" Minks confessed. Sir Eustace glanced at him, causing Minks to falter. ""Rats desert a sinking ship,"" Sir Eustace commented. ""I detest rats. Vermin must be exterminated sooner or later."" ""There's one thing you should know, Sir Eustace,"" I interjected. ""The tin you threw out the window didn't have the diamonds. It contained pebbles. The diamonds are safe in the giraffe's stomach. Suzanne hid them there with cotton wool to keep them quiet,"" I revealed. Sir Eustace stared at me before saying, ""I always despised that giraffe. It must have been instinct."" We couldn't head back to Johannesburg that night. The shelling was intense, and we were nearly cut off due to the rebels' advancements in the suburbs. We sought refuge at a farm about twenty miles from Johannesburg, exhausted from the recent events. The anticipation of a peaceful future with Harry, free from danger, filled me with relief. But a subtle tension lingered between us, hinting at unspoken truths.",1
"""I sensed a light touch on my arm. Poirot stood beside me. “Shall we make a discreet exit, my friend? I believe our services are no longer required.” Once outside, Poirot paused, then surprisingly remarked, “I would like to see the neighboring room.” The door was open, and we entered. The room, a large double one, was empty. Dust was visible, and Poirot made a face as he ran his finger along a rectangular mark on a table by the window. “The cleaning leaves much to be desired,” he dryly observed. Standing by the window lost in thought, he seemed deep in contemplation. “Well?” I impatiently inquired. “Why did we come in here?” He snapped out of his reverie. “Excuse me, my friend. I wanted to check if the door was bolted on this side as well.” “It is,” I confirmed, glancing at the door connecting to the previous room. Poirot nodded. “And, in any case,” I added, “why does it matter? The case is closed. I wish you had more opportunities to shine. But even an incompetent inspector could not have failed on this case.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not closed, my friend. It will only be closed once we uncover the thief behind the pearl theft.” “But the maid did it!” “How do you know?” “Because the pearls were found in her mattress.” “Tsk, tsk, tsk!” Poirot impatiently dismissed. “Those were not the real pearls.” “What?” “Imitations, my friend.” This revelation left me speechless. Poirot smiled calmly. “The inspector clearly knows nothing about jewels. But there will be quite a commotion soon!” “Come!” I urged, pulling at his arm. “Where to?” “We must inform the Opalsens immediately.” “I don’t think so.” “But that poor woman” “Well; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a more peaceful night believing her jewels are safe.” “But what if the thief escapes with them?” “As always, my friend, you speak without thinking. How can you be sure that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen secured so carefully tonight were not the fake ones, and that the real theft happened much earlier?” “Oh!” I exclaimed, bewildered. “Exactly,” Poirot beamed. “We start anew.” He led the way out of the room, pausing briefly before heading down the corridor to a small den where the staff from different floors gathered. Our chambermaid was holding court, sharing her recent experiences. Poirot interrupted politely. “Excuse me, but could you unlock Mr. Opalsen’s room for me?” The chambermaid obliged, and we entered Mr. Opalsen’s room, which faced his wife’s room across the corridor. Poirot asked the chambermaid if she had ever seen a card like the one he presented. She had not. Poirot then signaled for me to ring the bell for the valet. As he questioned the valet and showed him the card, it became clear that neither of them had seen such a card among Mr. Opalsen’s possessions. Poirot, still thoughtful, muttered, “And the necklace was heavily insured...”",1
"As he performed the act, half of the spectators erupted in loud barks of ""Woof, woof!"" possibly a Dutch equivalent to ""Hear, hear,"" while the other half jolted awake from their peaceful slumber. I was informed that the man had been talking non-stop for a staggering three days. It appears patience is a virtue in South Africa. I concocted numerous reasons to detain Pagett in Cape Town, but my creativity has finally reached its limit. Tomorrow, he will accompany me with the loyalty of a faithful dog ready to meet his end by his master's side.",1
"She was a stranger to the London crowd. The images of the Marlow victim in the newspapers were so distorted that it's no surprise no one could recognize them. On the flip side, Nadina had concealed her plans to visit England from everyone. The day following the homicide, her manager received a letter supposedly from the dancer, stating she was rushing back to Russia due to urgent personal matters and he should handle her terminated contract as he saw fit. I only found out about all of this later. With Suzanne's complete agreement, I dispatched a lengthy telegram from De Aar. It arrived at a crucial moment (this, too, I discovered afterward).",1
"""Poirot hesitated before speaking, his voice barely a whisper: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is as follows: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, straight nose, no distinctive marks.” “Could it be Mrs. Robinson?” I interjected. “It's a possibility,” Poirot conceded. “Furthermore, there was a report of a dark-skinned man, possibly a foreigner, asking about the residents of No. 4 just this morning. Therefore, my friend, I suggest we abandon our sleep tonight and keep watch in the apartment below with your trusty revolver, of course!” “Count me in,” I responded eagerly.""",1
"I wanted to go to the Magnificent right away to inform Miss Marvell about what had happened, however Poirot rejected the idea, saying that the next morning would be more suitable. I reluctantly agreed. The following morning, Poirot appeared hesitant to leave the house. I started to think that maybe he was reluctant to continue with the investigation after realizing his initial mistake. When I tried to persuade him, he logically pointed out that since the details of the Yardly Chase incident were already in the morning newspapers, the Rolfs would be as informed as we were. I reluctantly conceded.",1
"Renauld left his tattered coat and pants in the shed, avoiding bringing them inside the house. To support Madame Renauld's story, they cruelly stabbed him with an airplane dagger. That evening, Mr. Renauld tied up his wife and silenced her, then proceeded to dig a grave in the precise location where he planned to build a shelter. It was crucial for the corpse to be discovered without raising any doubts for Madame Daubreuil. Waiting a while would reduce the risk of being identified.",1
"Not until I reached the pier, after enduring the tedious formalities demanded by bureaucratic red tape, could I finally relax. No one had been arrested, and as I basked in the glorious weather, my hunger became apparent. Suzanne and I would be spending the night at the hotel. The boat wasn't departing for Port Elizabeth and Durban until the next morning. We hailed a taxi and headed to the Mount Nelson. The day was absolutely delightful - the sun, the breeze, the blooming flowers! Compared to the dreary January days in Little Hampsly, with its muddy terrain and constant rain, I couldn't help but revel in my current surroundings.",1
"I had informed the stewardess of my cold and insensitivity to smells. She appeared distressed, but I stood my ground. The evening dragged on, and I retired to bed, ready for any emergency. Vague thoughts crossed my mind, but I was certain that something would happen at one o’clock. The cabin was filled with silence as my fellow passengers settled in for the night. Suddenly, my door burst open, and a panicked man stumbled inside, pleading for help. With only seconds to spare, I swiftly concealed him behind my trunk and washed basin, transforming my appearance into that of a lady preparing for bed. When the door opened again, I was surprised to find a night stewardess standing there, looking for the source of the earlier noise.",1
"I chuckled. Everyone pokes fun at that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t until they settled in communities, with women doing one thing and men doing another, that women became weak. And deep down, we still feel the same, I mean, and that's why women admire physical strength in men - it's what they used to have and have lost.” “Almost like ancestor worship, isn't it?” “Something along those lines.” “And you truly believe that? That women worship strength?” “I think it's quite true, to be honest. You may think you appreciate moral qualities, but when you fall in love, your primal instincts take over. But I don’t think it ends there. If we still lived in primitive conditions, it might be fine, but we don’t, so ultimately, the other qualities prevail. It’s the things that seem defeated that always triumph in the end, isn’t it? They triumph in the only way that matters. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” Colonel Race mused, “you fall in love and then you fall out of it, is that what you’re getting at?” “Not exactly, but you could put it that way if you want.” “But have you ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I confessed openly. “Or fallen in love, for that matter?” I remained silent. The car stopped at our destination, bringing our conversation to a halt. We got out and began the gradual climb to the World’s View. Once again, I felt a slight unease in Colonel Race’s presence. He concealed his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He intimidated me a little. He always had. I never knew where I stood with him. We ascended in silence until we reached the spot where Rhodes lay protected by massive boulders. A peculiar, eerie place, far from human habitation, that sang a constant hymn of rugged beauty. We sat there in silence for a while. Then we descended once more, deviating slightly from the path. At times it was a tricky climb, and we encountered a steep slope or rock that was nearly vertical. Colonel Race led the way, then turned to assist me. “It would be easier to carry you,” he said suddenly, lifting me off the ground with a swift motion. I felt his strength as he placed me down and let go. A man made of iron, with muscles like tense steel. And once again, I felt a sense of fear, especially when he didn’t step aside, but stood directly in front of me, gazing into my eyes. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he asked abruptly. “I’m a wanderer exploring the world.” “Yes, that’s accurate. The newspaper correspondent is just a cover. You aren’t cut out to be a journalist. You’re seeking your own adventure in life. But there’s more to it.” What was he trying to make me reveal? I was afraid, terrified. I stared directly back at him. My eyes may not hide secrets like his, but they can wage war on the enemy’s territory. “What are you truly doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment, I thought he wouldn’t respond. He was clearly caught off guard, though. Finally, he spoke, and his words seemed to amuse him grimly. “Chasing ambition,” he replied. “Just that, chasing ambition. You'll recall, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I said slowly, “that you have ties to the Government, that you are part of the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my imagination, or did he pause for a fraction of a second before answering? “I assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am solely here as a private individual, traveling for my own enjoyment.” Reflecting on his response later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps that was his intention. We returned to the car in silence. Halfway back to Bulawayo, we stopped for tea at a rather basic structure by the road. The owner was gardening and seemed irritated at being interrupted. However, he kindly agreed to see what he could offer. After a lengthy wait, he brought us some stale cakes and lukewarm tea. Then he went back to his garden. As soon as he left, we were surrounded by cats. Six of them, all meowing pitifully at once. The noise was deafening. I offered them some cake, which they devoured eagerly. I poured the remaining milk into a saucer, and they fought among themselves to lap it up. “Oh,” I exclaimed indignantly, “they’re famished! It’s cruel. Please, please, ask for more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race left quietly to fulfill my request. The cats began meowing again. He returned with a large jug of milk, which the cats finished swiftly. I stood up, determination etched on my face. “I’m taking those cats with us. I can't leave them here.” “My dear, you can’t be serious. You can't carry six cats along with fifty wooden animals.” “Forget the wooden animals. These cats are living beings. I'm bringing them back with me.” “You won't do any such thing.” I glared at him resentfully, but he continued, “You may think me heartless, but one mustn’t go through life sentimentalizing over these matters. There's no use arguing - I won't let you take them. This is a primitive land, and I’m stronger than you.” I always recognize when I’m defeated. I walked back to the car with tears in my eyes. “They're probably just short of food today,” he reassured me. “That man’s wife has gone to Bulawayo for supplies. So everything will be fine. And besides, you know, there are countless starving cats in the world.” “Don’t,” I said vehemently. “I'm teaching you to confront life as it is. I'm teaching you to be tough and ruthless, like me. That’s the key to strength and success.”",1
"""But I am not one to partake in the frantic pursuit of a needle in a haystack, as you English say. Let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. I am confident that I will locate her when the time is right. For now, I am willing to be patient."" I gazed at him skeptically. Was he trying to deceive me? I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still in control of the situation. My feeling of superiority was slowly fading. Despite orchestrating the girl's escape and devising a clever plan to protect her from the repercussions of her impulsive actions, I couldn't shake my unease.",1
"As the butler entered, a telegram was presented to Lord Yardly on a silver platter. After a quick apology, he opened it and his expression changed. Passing it to his wife, he then turned to Monsieur Poirot. ""I believe you should be informed. Hoffberg has a potential buyer for the diamond - an American leaving for the States tomorrow. A representative will inspect the stone tonight. If this deal goes through..."" Lord Yardly's voice trailed off, his wife staring blankly at the telegram in her hand.",1
"I quickly retreated into the shadows, observing as the man conversed with Guy Pagett. Any lingering doubts I may have had were dispelled by this interaction. Pagett consulted his watch before the two exchanged a few words, after which the man made his way towards the station. It was clear that Pagett had given him instructions, but what were they exactly? Suddenly, my heart raced as the man who had been tailing me approached a policeman in the middle of the road. They engaged in a lengthy discussion, gesturing towards Cartwright's and appearing to explain something. It became clear to me - I was being set up for an arrest, likely on false charges such as pickpocketing.",1
"""They were both dressed in dark coats with hats pulled low over their eyes."" The magistrate paused, eyeing them suspiciously. ""Too much facial hair,"" he muttered. ""Are they impostors?"" questioned the woman. ""Indeed,"" confirmed the magistrate. ""Please, go on with your account."" She continued, ""The smaller of the two grabbed me, shoving a cloth in my mouth before tying my hands and feet with rope. Meanwhile, the other intruder loomed over my husband, brandishing my small dagger from the vanity table dangerously close to his chest.""",1
"“No, I do not believe so. It appeared that they were wearing fake beards, thought the examining magistrate, but still no.” She appeared to have made a firm decision. “I am certain that neither of the two individuals was this man.” “Understood, madame. That will be all then.” With her head held high, she left, the sun glinting off the silver strands in her hair. Jack Renauld followed her. He, too, could not identify the man, in a very natural manner. Giraud simply grunted. Whether he was satisfied or disappointed, I couldn't say. He just called out to Marchaud: “Do you have the other one?” “Yes, sir.” “Bring her in then.” “The other” was Madame Daubreuil. She entered indignantly, vehemently protesting. “I object, sir! This is an outrage! What does this have to do with me?” “Madame,” Giraud said harshly, “I am investigating not one murder, but two! For all I know, you may have committed both.” “How dare you?” she exclaimed. “How dare you insult me with such a wild accusation! It's outrageous.” “Outrageous, is it? What do you have to say about this?” Bending down, he once again removed the hair and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He moved closer to her. “May I compare it?” With a cry, she stepped back, pale as a ghost. “It is fake, I swear. I know nothing about either crime. Anyone who says otherwise is lying! Oh, my God, what should I do?” “Calm down, madame,” Giraud said coldly. “No one has accused you yet. But it would be wise to answer my questions promptly.” “Whatever you wish, sir.” “Look at the deceased. Have you ever seen him before?” Approaching, a hint of color returning to her face, Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with some interest and curiosity. Then she shook her head. “I don't recognize him.” It seemed impossible to doubt her, the words flowed so naturally. Giraud dismissed her with a nod. “Are you letting her go?” I whispered. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is hers.” “I don't need advice on how to do my job,” Giraud replied dryly. “She is under surveillance. I have no intention of arresting her yet.” Frowning, he looked down at the body. “Would you say he looks Spanish at all?” he suddenly asked. Examining the face carefully, I finally said, “No, I would definitely say he looks French.” Giraud grunted in dissatisfaction. “I agree.” He stood there for a moment, then gestured for me to move aside, and once again, on hands and knees, he resumed his search of the shed floor. He was meticulous. Nothing eluded him. He went over the floor inch by inch, turning over pots, inspecting old sacks. He seized a bundle by the door, but it turned out to be just a ragged coat and trousers, and he tossed it aside with a growl. Two pairs of old gloves caught his attention, but ultimately he shook his head and set them aside. Then he returned to the pots, methodically examining them one by one. In the end, he stood up and shook his head thoughtfully. He seemed puzzled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten I was there. But at that moment, there was a commotion outside, and the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex, entered with the doctor trailing behind. “This is extraordinary, Mr. Giraud,” M. Hautet exclaimed. “Another crime! Ah, we have not yet unraveled this case. There is a deep mystery here. But who is the victim this time?” “That is precisely what no one can tell us, M. le juge. He has not been identified.” “Where is the body?” inquired the doctor. Giraud stepped aside slightly. “Over there in the corner. He was stabbed in the heart, as you can see. And with the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning. I suspect the murder occurred shortly after the theft, but that is for you to determine. You can handle the dagger freely, there are no fingerprints on it.” The doctor knelt beside the deceased, and Giraud turned to the examining magistrate. “A rather intriguing problem, isn't it? But I will solve it.” “So no one can identify him,” pondered the magistrate. “Could he possibly be one of the assailants? Perhaps they turned on each other.” Giraud shook his head. “I would bet my life that the man is French.” But they were interrupted by the doctor, who was sitting back on his heels with a puzzled expression. “You say he was killed yesterday morning?” “I deduced that from the dagger theft,” Giraud explained. “He might, of course, have been killed later in the day.” “Later in the day? Nonsense! This man has been dead for at least forty-eight hours, if not longer.” We stared at each other in disbelief. The doctor's statement was so unexpected that we were momentarily stunned. Here was a man stabbed with a dagger that had been stolen just twenty-four hours earlier, yet Dr. Durand asserted confidently that he had been dead for at least forty-eight hours! The situation was incredibly puzzling. Still reeling from the shock of the doctor's revelation, a telegram was delivered to me. It had been sent from the hotel to the Villa. I opened it eagerly. It was from Poirot, informing me of his return on the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28. Glancing at my watch, I realized I had just enough time to comfortably reach the station and meet him there. I felt it was crucial that he be informed immediately of the new and astonishing developments in the case. It seemed that Poirot had no trouble finding what he needed in Paris. His swift return was proof of that. Only a few hours had passed. I wondered how he would react to the thrilling news I had to share. The train was running a few minutes late, so I wandered back and forth on the platform until I decided to inquire about who had departed Merlinville on the last train on the night of the tragedy. I approached the head porter, a sharp-looking man, and easily engaged him in conversation about the topic. He vehemently believed it was a disgrace that such criminals and murderers were allowed to roam free.",1
"In the cozy study, we found a charming couple - the man with a weathered face resembling a withered apple, and his wife exuding a sense of calm with her ample frame. Exhausted from the journey and the long drive, we had quickly retired to bed after a delicious meal of roast chicken, apple pie, and thick Devonshire cream. After a satisfying breakfast, we gathered in the small, wood-paneled room that once belonged to the late Mr. Marsh. A roll-top desk, meticulously organized with papers, adorned one wall, while a large leather armchair, clearly the favorite spot of its former owner, sat prominently in the room.",1
"""Listen, my friend, I understand your feelings on this dreadful matter. I have not handled it well! If you were in my position, you might have handled it better! Fine! Let's move on from it and grab some lunch."" By the time we arrived at Poirot's place, it was around four o’clock. A man stood up from a seat near the window. It was Lord Yardly. He appeared worn out and troubled. ""I received your message and hurried here. I went to Hoffberg, but they deny any knowledge of their employee from last night or the telegram. Could it be that"" Poirot interrupted him. ""I apologize! I sent that telegram and recruited the man in question.""",1
"A large settee covered in chintz sat against the wall, while the window seats were also draped in the same faded chintz. Poirot, lighting a cigarette, discussed their plan. He believed the clue they sought was in the room, hidden among the documents in the desk. Despite not expecting to find the will, Poirot suspected a seemingly innocent paper held the key. After calling for Mrs. Baker, they learned about the will-signing and the mysterious workmen from Plymouth. Poirot deduced that a second will had been made, with a hiding spot created by the workmen. In Plymouth, they confirmed the details and discovered the hidden cavity behind a brick in the fireplace. With excitement, Poirot reached into the cavity.",1

I recounted the intense questioning I had endured. Instantly regretting it, I noticed a familiar gleam in his eye. I quickly shifted the topic of conversation.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, everyone fast asleep. Poirot and I stood beneath Mrs. Renauld's open window, waiting. Suddenly, a cry for help echoed through the night, a light flickered in an upper room. Poirot sprang into action, climbing up a tree and through the window. I followed, marveling at Dulcie's acrobatic skills. Inside, Mrs. Renauld was safe, but Marthe Daubreuil lay dead on the floor. Poirot's deduction of the events that transpired that night left me speechless. The murderer had been unmasked, thanks to a clever ruse and a stolen dagger. The night's events were stranger than any dream.",1
"""Poirot's gaze bore into him, his eyes slitted like a cat's, revealing only a glint of green. ""Then it seems there is a peculiar error, one that even the station staff share. They claim you disembarked from the 11:40 train."" Jack Renauld hesitated briefly, then resolved to speak. ""And if I did? Surely you're not suggesting I had a hand in my father's demise?"" His tone was proud, chin lifted. ""I demand to know why you are here."" ""It's quite straightforward. I came to visit my betrothed, Mademoiselle Daubreuil.""",1
"""But Poirot's skills surpassed mine. In mere moments, he uncovered the entire tale, his eyes gleaming with amusement. “Ah! A story filled with romance. What is the name of this captivating young woman?” I had to admit that I was unaware. “Even more romantic! The initial encounter on the Paris train, the subsequent one here. Journeys conclude with lovers’ reunions, is that not the saying?” “Stop being ridiculous, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Truly, you possess the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You ought to establish a harem!” “It’s easy for you to mock me.""",1
"The purser conveyed his apologies for her absence in a sincerely manner as he assigned me her room, and afterwards Colonel Race shared some intriguing insights about her.

"“Discussing apartments,” she mentioned, “have you heard about our stroke of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve finally secured an apartment! In Montagu Mansions.” “Ah,” Parker replied, “I’ve always said that there are plenty of apartments available for a price!” “Yes, but this one isn’t at a price. It’s very inexpensive. Only eighty pounds a year!” “But Montagu Mansions is near Knightsbridge, correct? A grand building. Or are you referring to a less affluent location with the same name in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one. That’s what makes it so extraordinary.” “Extraordinary indeed! It’s a complete miracle. But there must be a catch somewhere. A large premium, I assume?” “No premium!” “No pre oh, help me, somebody!” groaned Parker. “But we do need to purchase the furniture,” Mrs. Robinson continued. “Ah!” Parker perked up. “I knew there was a catch!” “For fifty pounds. And it’s furnished beautifully!” “I surrender,” said Parker. “The current tenants must be lunatics with a penchant for generosity.” Mrs. Robinson appeared slightly troubled. A slight frown appeared between her delicate brows. “It is odd, isn’t it? You don’t think that the place is haunted?” “I’ve never heard of a haunted apartment,” Parker stated firmly. “N-o.” Mrs. Robinson seemed far from convinced. “But there were several things about the whole situation that struck me as well, odd.” “For example” I prompted. “Ah,” said Parker, “our expert on crime is intrigued! Tell him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is excellent at unraveling mysteries.” I chuckled, feeling embarrassed but not entirely displeased with the role assigned to me. ""Oh, not particularly odd, Captain Hastings, but when we visited the agents, Stosser and Paul - we hadn’t tried them before because they only handle the expensive Mayfair apartments - but we thought it wouldn’t hurt to see. Everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or huge premiums, and then, just before we were leaving, they mentioned that they had an apartment for eighty, but they doubted whether it would be worth our time going there, because it had been on their books for some time and they had sent so many people to view it that it was almost certain to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not informing them, and then they continued sending, and people get irritated at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been rented some time.” Mrs. Robinson stopped to catch her breath, then continued: “We thanked him, and said that we understood it probably wouldn’t work out, but that we’d like an order just in case. And we went there immediately in a taxi, because, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson - she’s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are also looking for an apartment - came rushing down the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said. ‘But it’s no use. It’s already taken.’ That seemed to settle it, but well, as John said, the place was very affordable, we could offer more, and perhaps if we offered a premium. A horrible thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know how it is with apartment hunting.” I assured her that I was well aware that in the battle for housing, the baser aspects of human nature often triumphed over the higher ones, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied. “So we went up and, can you believe it, the apartment wasn’t taken at all. We were shown around by the maid, and then we met the landlady, and the deal was sealed then and there. Immediate move-in and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement the following day, and we are set to move in tomorrow!” Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly. “And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s hear your deductions, Hastings.” “‘Elementary, my dear Watson,’” I quoted playfully. “She went to the wrong apartment.” “Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” exclaimed Mrs. Robinson admiringly. I somewhat wished Poirot had been present. Sometimes I have the feeling that he underestimates my abilities. The whole situation was rather amusing, and I presented it as a mock problem to Poirot the next morning. He seemed intrigued and questioned me closely about the rents of apartments in various locations. “A curious tale,” he said thoughtfully. “Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a brief walk.” When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes gleamed with a peculiar excitement. He placed his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual delicate care before he spoke. “It is fortunate, my friend, that we have no pressing matters at the moment. We can devote ourselves entirely to this investigation.” “What investigation are you referring to?” “The remarkably low cost of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new apartment.” “Poirot, you can’t be serious!” “I am very serious. Imagine, my friend, that the actual rent for those apartments is £350. I have just confirmed that with the landlord’s agents. And yet this specific apartment is being sublet for eighty pounds! Why?” “There must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as Mrs. Robinson suggested.” Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “Then again how strange it is that her friend informs her the apartment is taken, and yet when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!” “But surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong apartment. That is the only logical explanation.” “You may or may not be correct on that point, Hastings. The fact remains that several other applicants were sent to view it, and yet, despite its incredibly low cost, it was still available when Mrs. Robinson arrived.” “That suggests that there must be something amiss with it.” “Mrs. Robinson didn’t seem to notice anything wrong. Very curious, isn’t it? Did she strike you as a truthful woman, Hastings?” “She was a delightful person!” “Of course! since you are unable to answer my question. Describe her to me, then.” “Well, she’s tall and fair; her hair is truly a beautiful shade of auburn” “You have always had a fondness for auburn hair!” murmured Poirot. “But continue.”",1

""Yet he wrote affectionate letters to him while in Paris?"" ""That's what Jack Renauld claims, but he can't provide them."" ""Let's move on from that."" ""Now, let's focus on the day of the tragedy. You have arranged the events of the morning in a specific sequence. Do you have any reasoning for that?"" ""I have confirmed that the letter to me was sent at the same time as the telegram was dispatched. Masters was told he could take time off shortly after that.""",1
"""But Madame Daubreuil has vanished. The authorities are on the hunt for her."" ""Do you think she was involved with her daughter?"" ""We may never find out. Madame is skilled at keeping her secrets. I highly doubt the police will locate her."" ""Has Jack Renauld been informed?"" ""Not yet."" ""This news will hit him hard."" ""Indeed. However, I suspect his feelings were never deeply invested. While we viewed Bella Duveen as a temptress and Marthe Daubreuil as his true love, I believe the opposite may be closer to reality.""",1
"""If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started"" ""My dear fellow,"" I interrupted brutally, ""that was a bilious attack. You’re always having bilious attacks."" Pagett winced slightly. ""It wasn’t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time “For God’s sake, don’t go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don’t want to hear them."" “Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!” “Ah!” I said. “You’ve been talking to Rayburn.” He did not deny it. “At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.” Pagett’s voice dropped again. “But that’s camouflage, I’m sure. So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson’s feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn’t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: “Don’t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well. I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did not know how intensely respectable he is I should suspect him of some disreputable amou. I wonder now! Even the most respectable menIt would cheer me up enormously if it was so. Pagett with a guilty secret! Splendid! It has been a curious evening. The only costume that fitted me in the barber’s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear. I don’t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter’s evening in England but it’s hardly an ideal costume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up.",1
"Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business from both sides. Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair, who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably. Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me. A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause.",1
"I struggled against the grip on my throat, biting and scratching in the most approved feminine fashion. The man had to keep me from crying out, hindering his movements. Despite my efforts, I felt myself weakening. Sensing this, my assailant put out all his strength. Suddenly, another shadow appeared, running on swift noiseless feet. With one powerful blow, he sent my opponent crashing to the deck. Finally released, I fell back against the rail, feeling sick and trembling.",1
"""There was a subtle shift in his attitude towards me. 'I have an update for you. Your boyfriend is on his way. He'll arrive shortly. Keep your emotions in check, I have more to tell you. You tried to trick me this morning. I advised you to be honest, and initially you complied. But then you veered off course. You tried to convince me that the diamonds were with Harry Rayburn. I went along with it at first because it made it easier for me to persuade you to lure Harry Rayburn here.""",1
"It was clear that out of several hundred applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Elsa Hardt and her partner, from New York, took the flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson to escape the Mafia or the Camorra. They offered the flat at a low rental to attract a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson. The plan was to strike when the avenger arrived. Poirot deduced this scheme and saved them from being hanged. The house was watched, and the police were on their way. Our beautiful lady will not escape.",1
"""And, really, he may be against him for all we know. To continue my surmises, Rayburn is the 'Man in the Brown Suit.' He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him"" ""Who?"" I asked. ""Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found 'The Man in the Brown Suit,' and your fortune’s made, Anne!"" ""There are several things you’ve overlooked."" ""What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know, but a scar can be faked easily enough. He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?"" I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of anthropology. ""Dolichocephalic,"" I said lightly. Suzanne looked doubtful. ""Was that it?"" ""Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,"" I explained fluently. There was a pause. I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: ""What’s the opposite?"" ""What do you mean the opposite?"" ""Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length."" ""Brachycephalic,"" I murmured unwillingly. ""That’s it. I thought that was what you said."" ""Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,"" I said with all the assurance I could muster. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she laughed. ""You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it."" ""There’s nothing to tell,"" I said unwillingly. ""Isn’t there?"" said Suzanne gently. ""I suppose I shall have to tell you,"" I said slowly. ""I’m not ashamed of it. You can’t be ashamed of something that just happens to you. That’s what he did. He was detestable rude and ungrateful but that I think I understand. It’s like a dog that’s been chained up or badly treated it’ll bite anybody. That’s what he was like bitter and snarling. I don’t know why I care but I do. I care horribly. Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down. I love him. I want him. I’ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I find him, and I’ll make him care for me. I’d die for him. I’d work for him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him! There now you know!"" Suzanne looked at me for a long time. ""You’re very un-English, Gipsy girl,"" she said at last. ""There’s not a scrap of the sentimental about you. I’ve never met any one who was at once so practical and so passionate. I shall never care for any one like that mercifully for me and yet and yet I envy you, Gipsy girl. It’s something to be able to care. Most people can’t. But what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn’t marry him. He doesn’t sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy keeping high explosive in the house! So there’s to be no cabling to Lord Nasby?"" I shook my head. ""And yet you believe him to be innocent?"" ""I also believe that innocent people can be hanged."" ""Hm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In spite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman."" ""No,"" I said. ""He didn’t."" ""That’s sentiment."" ""No, it isn’t. He might have killed her. He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands."" Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. ""Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!"" I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. ""How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?"" I shook my head. ""Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever."" ""What enthusiasm!"" ""Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?"" We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress. ""That was a very interesting story you told us last night,"" I said, breaking the silence. ""Which one?"" ""The one about the diamonds."" ""I believe women are always interested in diamonds."" ""Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them."" ""Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too."" ""And what happened to him eventually, I mean. Does any one know?"" Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions. Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: ""He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed."" That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. ""The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood."" I got it all out of him, little by little.""",1
"” Adventuresses should never be too rigid in their approaches. The plan succeeded. A servant in powdered wig accepted the card and took it away. Soon a timid secretary showed up. I engaged in a verbal sparring match with him and emerged victorious. He left in defeat. Shortly after, he returned and implored me to follow him. I complied. I found myself in a spacious chamber, a frightened shorthand typist hurried past me as if a ghostly apparition. The door closed behind me, leaving me alone with Lord Nasby. A formidable figure. Large head. Broad face. Thick moustache. Stout belly. I composed myself. I had not intended to focus on Lord Nasby's physique. He was already shouting at me.”",1
"I followed her lead, purchasing a variety of trinkets for a mere “tiki” (threepence) each. The selection ranged from giraffes and tigers to snakes and a forlorn eland, not to mention comical little black warriors. The thrill was palpable as we reveled in the moment. Despite Sir Eustace's attempts to rein us in, our enthusiasm could not be contained. It's a wonder we weren't left stranded at some remote station along the route. South African locomotives depart without fanfare, silently slipping away as you scramble back on board. Suzanne's astonishment at my last-minute boarding in Cape Town was priceless.",1
"""I never suspected you to be a fool, my dear lady, but might I suggest that you are rather reckless? The 'Colonel' is not one to tolerate blackmail, you know."" ""I have no fear of him,"" she chuckled. ""There is only one man who has ever truly frightened me, and he's long gone."" The man regarded her with a curious expression. ""Let's hope he doesn't return from the dead,"" he quipped. ""What do you mean?"" the dancer demanded. The Count appeared taken aback. ""I simply meant that a resurrection would be inconvenient for you,"" he clarified. ""Just a silly jest."" She breathed a sigh of relief. ""Oh, no need to worry. He's definitely dead. Killed in the war.""",1
"I couldn't believe my luck when I saw my target casually sipping beef tea by the rail. I approached him with a friendly smile, hoping to smooth things over after the cabin mix-up. Mr. Chichester, however, was not so forgiving. As we exchanged words, I couldn't help but notice that his skin was surprisingly fair for someone who claimed to have spent two years in the depths of Africa. His reaction to a dropped paper only deepened my suspicions. It was clear that Mr. Chichester was not to be trusted. Later, during a conversation about Italy, the strange behavior of Mr. Pagett only added to my growing list of suspects. The more I observed, the more I realized that any one of them could be hiding something sinister.",1
"I adored Falls, a place I cherished deeply. After dinner, Sir Eustace secluded himself with Miss Pettigrew. A mysterious note from Harry Rayburn urged me to the palm gully clearing. Hesitating, I set out, wary of being followed. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows and chased me. Panicked, I tripped and fell into darkness. Awakening in a strange room, I found Harry Rayburn sitting beside me. Grateful for his presence, I wept with relief. His comforting words and a cup of milk eased my fears. As I drifted back to sleep, I knew I was safe in his care.",1
"""A shadow flickered across the actress's face as she responded stiffly: ""I'm sorry, but that's not possible."" ""Do you have it on you, hmm?"" Poirot observed her closely. The young woman paused briefly, then reached into the neckline of her dress, pulling out a slender chain. Leaning forward, she opened her hand. Nestled in her palm was a dazzling white gem, expertly placed in a platinum setting, gleaming solemnly at us. Poirot gasped softly. ""Magnificent!"" he whispered.""",1
"We stood face to face, locked in a fierce gaze of animosity. It was the first time I truly observed his features - the closely cropped dark hair, the angular jawline, the scar on his tan cheek, and his piercing light grey eyes that held a hint of reckless disdain. There was an undeniable air of danger that surrounded him. ""You haven't even said thank you for me saving your sorry life,"" I taunted with feigned sweetness, delivering a blow that made him visibly recoil. I sensed his deep aversion to acknowledging his debt to me, but I relished in his discomfort. The desire to inflict pain upon him consumed me like never before. ""I wish you weren't around to save me in the first place!"" he exclaimed with explosive frustration.",1
"""Ever since M. Renauld arrived at Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has been depositing large amounts of money in notes at the bank. It adds up to a total of four thousand pounds in English currency,"" Stonor explained calmly. ""I simply transferred the money to him as he requested. It was not some kind of scheme."" The magistrate was taken aback. ""Then what could it have been?"" Stonor's hand came down on the table with a resounding thud. ""Blackmail,"" he stated firmly. The magistrate was visibly startled. ""Blackmail,"" Stonor repeated.",1
"""But do we really need to consider that? I cannot fathom Madame Renauld being in cahoots with Madame Daubreuil for a variety of reasons, some of which I have already discussed with you. The rest should be quite obvious. With that possibility out of the way, we are getting closer to the real truth, which is, as always, quite fascinating and intriguing.""“Poirot,” I exclaimed, “what else have you uncovered?”“My dear friend, you must rely on your own reasoning. You have all the necessary information at your disposal! Engage your mind. Think not as Giraud does, but as Hercule Poirot does.”“But can we be certain?”“Trust me, in many instances I have acted foolishly.",1
"Colonel Race was determined to see Sir Eustace face the consequences of his actions. Given Sir Eustace's network of spies and agents in Jo'burg, it was no surprise he had managed to escape. Colonel Race doubted they would ever be able to capture him, especially considering his well-thought-out escape plan. Despite my reservations, I nodded along as Colonel Race discussed the situation. The conversation fell quiet until Colonel Race inquired about Harry, to which I replied that he had left at dawn and I hadn't seen him since.",1
"The leather handbag she clutched tightly held an overstuffed wallet and a few coins, a delicate lace hanky with no initials, and the torn half of a train ticket to Paris. Not much to work with. These were the facts shared far and wide by the Evening Post, with ""Locate the Gentleman in the Tan Suit"" as their repeated call to action. Each day, approximately five hundred individuals penned letters boasting of their triumph in the pursuit, while statuesque youths with sun-kissed complexions lamented the moment they agreed to don a tan suit.",1
"I realized the enormity of the task I had set for Poirot. It would not be easy to secure Jack Renauld's acquittal. M. Hautet suggested that Madame Renauld may have been mistaken about the dagger, insinuating Jack's guilt. Jack's response only fueled further suspicion, leading to his inevitable condemnation by M. Hautet. Just as all hope seemed lost, a mysterious figure named Bella Duveen appeared, confessing to the murder of Mr. Renauld. Bella's confession shed light on the events leading up to the crime, revealing a tangled web of deceit and desperation.",1
"""We finished our meal and lingered by our coffee and cigarettes."" ""Had your husband departed for London by then?"" ""Indeed, he caught the 6.15 train."" ""Did he drive to the station or walk?"" ""We don't keep a car here. A vehicle from the Elmer's Dale garage picked him up."" ""Was Mr. Pace his usual self?"" ""Completely. Nothing seemed amiss."" ""Can you provide any details about the visitor?"" ""I'm sorry, I never laid eyes on him. Mrs. Middleton ushered him into the gun-room before informing my uncle.""",1
"""Damn it all, man,"" shouted Gregory Rolf, leaning in, ""do you see it now?"" The man glanced up at him and flinched. ""No, sir,"" he replied. ""I can't say that I do."" And in truth, there was nothing remotely exotic about the sincere brown eyes staring back at us. The detective grunted. ""Confident fellow. Expected the eyes to draw attention, so he took a bold approach to throw off suspicion. Must have shadowed you from the hotel and struck as soon as you were out of sight."" ""And what of the jewel case?"" I inquired. ""It was discovered in a hotel corridor.""",1
"Upon investigating, we notice three instances where M. Renauld's behavior shifts dramatically, indicating three crucial psychological turning points. The first occurs upon his arrival in Merlinville, the second following a heated argument with his son, and the third on the morning of June 7th. The reasons behind these changes are as follows: the influence of Madame Daubreuil is to blame for the first, the impending marriage between Renauld's son and Daubreuil's daughter for the second, but the root cause of the third remains elusive, requiring deduction on our part.",1
"""Clearly, Giraud has missed the mark entirely. If Jack Renauld is truly guilty, it is despite Giraud's misguided arguments, not because of them. The most damning evidence against him is a secret that only I am aware of.""""What is it?"" I inquired, feeling intrigued.""If you were to engage your intellect, and analyze the case with the same clarity that I possess, you would also uncover it, my dear friend.""Poirot's response irritated me, as usual. Without pausing, he continued, ""Let us stroll towards the shoreline. We will perch on that small hill there, with a view of the beach, and reexamine the case. I will share all my insights with you, but I would rather you arrive at the truth independently, without my guidance.""",1
"Despite the recent betrayal, I knew the importance of monitoring his every move to protect Bella. Giraud and the French authorities showed no concern for her safety. It was crucial for me to stick close to Poirot at all times. His keen eyes caught my contemplative gaze, and he nodded in approval. ""You see the wisdom in my plan, don't you? Rather than risk you clumsily tailing me in a laughable disguise, let us journey together,"" he suggested.",1
"""Really?” “Yes, my dear Watson.” The revelation left me stunned. Holmes maintained a calm demeanor. “The detective inspector is clearly unaware of the true value. But chaos will ensue soon!” “Let's go!” I exclaimed, pulling at his coat sleeve. “Where to?” “We need to inform the Smithsons immediately.” “I disagree.” “What about the victim?” “Well; the victim, as you refer to her, will sleep soundly tonight thinking the treasures are secure.” “But the criminal might get away!” “Once again, my dear Watson, you jump to conclusions. How can you be certain the diamonds Mrs. Smithson...”",1
"""Consider this,"" I began, leaning in closer to my colleague. ""The evidence strongly suggests that Madame Daubreuil was not the mastermind behind it all. Instead, we must entertain the possibility that Georges Conneau orchestrated the entire scheme. Yes, that's it. Georges Conneau and Madame Renauld working together to commit the crime. But lurking in the shadows, there is a mysterious individual, operating under an unknown alias. Let's retrace our steps in the Renauld Case, starting from the very beginning. Do you have your notebook handy? Excellent. Now, what is the initial event we should document?"" ""The letter you received?"" ""While that was our first clue, it doesn't mark the true genesis of this investigation.",1
"""He was unfamiliar with Hercule Poirot's techniques. Unlike Poirot, he preferred to work internally, relying on his intuition and intellect rather than frantic legwork. This approach, he believed, was more effective. Poirot's dismissive attitude towards certain investigative methods sparked a debate. While fingerprints had indeed solved cases, Poirot pointed out the potential for wrongful convictions. His skepticism was met with resistance.""",1
"""It is him, over there."" He gestured to a man stepping out of the shadows. To my shock, it was the Prime Minister himself. Eager to unravel the mystery, I pressed Poirot for answers as we drove back to London. The story unfolded - the Prime Minister had been kidnapped on his way to London, not smuggled back as I had assumed. The details of the abduction were revealed, involving a clever plan orchestrated by Captain Daniels. The Prime Minister's double was convincingly portrayed, shielded from anyone who knew him well. As we crossed into France, the deception unraveled, leading to the Prime Minister's disappearance. The man who played the part of the Prime Minister discarded his disguise, leaving behind a trail of confusion.",1
"""Renauld. This case has been one of the most perplexing and baffling mysteries to crack. Someone like Giraud, who doesn't rely on psychology, is bound to come up short."" ""You're truly amazing, Poirot,"" I expressed with awe. ""Absolutely amazing. No one else could have pulled it off like you did!""I could tell my admiration made him happy. For once, he seemed almost bashful. ""So, you no longer look down on poor old Papa Poirot? You're back to supporting me instead of the human foxhound?"" His nickname for Giraud always brought a smile to my face. ""Absolutely.""",1
"That was an undeniable fact. An estate. Perhaps the origin of a noble bloodline. (Lost heir? Title contender?) Or maybe a charming dilapidated building. (Hidden riches?) Indeed, I was leaning towards the notion of hidden treasure. Enigmas always accompany hidden treasure. One step to the east, seven steps to the west, excavate one yard, descend twenty-two stairs. That type of concept. I could develop that later. The priority was to reach Kilmorden Castle promptly. I embarked on a calculated expedition from my quarters and came back loaded with research materials. _Who’s Who_, Whitaker, a Geographical Dictionary, a Compilation of Scottish Ancestral Dwellings, and a Publication on the British Isles. Moments slipped away.",1
"""And my marriage isn't as stable as I thought,"" Suzanne said sadly. ""Clarence has been sending urgent messages for me to return home, but I've ignored them for weeks now."" I couldn't bring myself to be too concerned about Suzanne's marital issues. She had a way of handling Clarence when necessary. Changing the topic, I brought up the matter of the missing diamonds. Suzanne's eyes widened in shock. ""Let me clarify, Anne. When I started suspecting Colonel Race, I became very anxious about the diamonds.""",1
"""I chuckled. Everyone mocks that giraffe. ""And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t until they settled down in communities, with women doing one type of work and men another, that women became weak. And deep down, one still feels the same, one remains the same, and that's why women admire physical strength in men - it's what they used to have and have now lost."" ""Almost like ancestor worship, isn't it?"" ""Something along those lines."" ""And do you truly believe that, that women worship strength?"" ""I believe it's quite accurate, if one is honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where only the physical matters. But I don't think that's the end of it. If you lived in primitive conditions, it might be acceptable, but you don't, and in the end, the other aspects prevail. It's the things that seem to be conquered that always emerge victorious, isn't it? They win in the only way that truly matters. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it."" ""Ultimately,"" Colonel Race pondered, ""you fall in love and then fall out of it, is that your point?"" ""Not exactly, but you can interpret it that way if you wish."" ""But you've never fallen out of love, Miss Anne, have you?"" ""No, I haven't,"" I confessed openly. ""Or fallen in love, for that matter?"" I remained silent. The car arrived at our destination and the conversation came to an end. We exited and started the gradual climb to the World's View. Colonel Race's presence made me slightly uneasy, as always. His thoughts were well concealed behind those impenetrable black eyes. He somewhat frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We ascended in silence until we arrived at the place where Rhodes is protected by enormous boulders. A peculiar, eerie place, far from civilization, singing a continuous hymn of rugged beauty. We sat there in silence for some time. Then we descended once more, deviating slightly from the path. Some parts required a challenging climb, and at one point we encountered a steep slope that was almost vertical. Colonel Race went first, then turned to assist me. ""It's better if I carry you,"" he stated suddenly, lifting me off the ground with a swift motion. I felt his strength as he placed me down and let go. A man of steel, with muscles like taut wires. I felt a sense of fear, especially as he didn't step aside, but stood directly in front of me, gazing into my eyes. ""What is your true purpose here, Anne Beddingfeld?"" he asked abruptly. ""I'm a wanderer exploring the world,"" I replied. ""Yes, that's accurate. The newspaper correspondent role is just a pretense. You don't possess the spirit of a journalist. You're out for your own gain, grasping at life. But there's more to it."" What was he trying to get me to reveal? I was afraid, terrified. I stared directly into his eyes. My eyes may not keep secrets like his, but they can bring the battle to the enemy's territory. ""What are you truly doing here, Colonel Race?"" I inquired deliberately. For a moment, I thought he wouldn't respond. He appeared taken aback, however. Finally, he spoke, his words seeming to amuse him grimly. ""Chasing ambition,"" he replied. ""Precisely that - chasing ambition. You'll recall, Miss Beddingfeld, that 'by that sin fell the angels,' etc."" ""Rumors suggest,"" I said slowly, ""that you are linked to the Government, that you are part of the Secret Service. Is that true?"" Was it my imagination, or did he hesitate for a split second before answering? ""I assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am here purely as a private individual traveling for my own pleasure."" Upon reflecting on the response later, it struck me as somewhat ambiguous. Perhaps he intended it to be so. We resumed our journey in silence. Halfway back to Bulawayo, we stopped for tea at a rather basic structure by the roadside. The proprietor was tending to the garden and seemed irritated by the interruption. However, he graciously agreed to see what he could provide. After a seemingly endless wait, he brought us some stale cakes and lukewarm tea. He then returned to his garden. As soon as he left, we were swarmed by cats. Six of them, meowing pitifully all at once. The noise was overwhelming. I offered them some cake, which they devoured eagerly. I poured all the milk into a saucer, and they fought to lap it up. ""Oh,"" I exclaimed indignantly, ""they're famished! It's cruel. Please, please, order more milk and another plate of cake."" Colonel Race left silently to fulfill my request. The cats began meowing again. He returned with a large jug of milk, which the cats drank entirely. I stood up, determination etched on my face. ""I'm taking those cats with us. I won't leave them here."" ""My dear, don't be absurd. You can't carry six cats along with fifty wooden animals,"" he remarked. ""Forget the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I'll bring them back with us."" ""You won't do any such thing."" I glared at him resentfully, but he continued, ""You may think me cruel, but one can't go through life sentimentalizing over these matters. It's pointless to resist. I won't let you take them. It's a primitive land, you know, and I am stronger than you."" I always recognize when I'm defeated. I headed to the car with tears in my eyes. ""They're likely just missing a meal today,"" he reassured me. ""That man's wife has gone to Bulawayo for supplies. So they'll be fine. And in any case, you know, there are plenty of starving cats in the world."" ""Stop it,"" I said firmly. ""I'm showing you the reality of life. I'm teaching you to be tough and ruthless, like I am. That's the key to strength and success.""",1
"""Come on now, sir, you can't underestimate the importance of details as clues, can you?"" ""Not at all. They all have their place. The risk is that they might be given too much significance. Most details are irrelevant; only a few are crucial. It's the mind, the little grey cells,"" he pointed to his head, ""that one must trust. The senses can be deceiving. The truth must be found internally, not externally."" ""Are you suggesting, Monsieur Poirot, that you could solve a case without even leaving your seat?"" ""That's exactly what I mean, provided that the facts were presented to me.""",1
"I had my doubts about Mrs. Blair and Anne's obsession with buying wooden animals at every station. The journey through Bechuanaland was filled with dust and primitive charm, as the Kafir children sold their hand-carved toys. The Hex river valley and the Karoo offered breathtaking scenery that was a stark contrast to the chaos of the train stops. Suzanne and I marveled at the sights, almost missing the train at each impromptu halt. The natives appeared out of nowhere, offering their wares, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the simplicity and beauty of their creations.",1
"""They fail to understand that an experienced examining magistrate like me possesses a certain discernment, a certain flair. Indeed! The courtesy of the old school suits me much better. So, my dear friend, feel free to give me any orders. We both know a thing or two, don't we?"" Laughing heartily and pleased with himself and us, M. Hautet bid us farewell. Regrettably, Poirot's first comment to me as we walked through the corridor was: ""That famous old imbecile! So stupid it's pitiful!"" As we exited the building, we encountered Giraud, looking more stylish than ever and thoroughly satisfied with himself. ""Aha! M. Poirot,"" he exclaimed casually. ""Back from England, I see?"" ""Indeed,"" replied Poirot. ""The conclusion of the case is near, I believe."" ""I concur, M. Giraud,"" Poirot said in a subdued tone. His dejected demeanor seemed to please the other man. ""The most insipid criminal of all! No attempt at defense. It's unbelievable!"" ""So unbelievable that it gives one pause, wouldn't you say?"" Poirot suggested mildly. But Giraud wasn't paying attention. He twirled his cane amicably. ""Well, good day, M. Poirot. I'm glad you're finally convinced of young Renauld's guilt."" ""Excuse me! But I am not convinced at all. Jack Renauld is innocent."" Giraud stared for a moment then burst into laughter, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: ""Crazy!"" Poirot straightened up. A dangerous glint appeared in his eyes. ""M. Giraud, your deliberate insults towards me throughout this case require a lesson. I am willing to bet you 500 francs that I will find M. Renauld's murderer before you do. Do we have a deal?"" Giraud stared helplessly and muttered again: ""Crazy!"" ""Come on now,"" urged Poirot, ""do we have a deal?"" ""I have no desire to take your money."" ""Rest assured, you won't!"" ""Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my insulting behavior towards you. Well, once or twice, your behavior has irritated me."" ""I am delighted to hear that,"" said Poirot. ""Good morning, M. Giraud. Let's go, Hastings."" I remained silent as we walked down the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had made his intentions clear. I doubted more than ever my ability to save Bella from the consequences of her actions. This unfortunate encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on alert. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and turned to see Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he suggested walking back to our hotel together. ""And why are you here, M. Stonor?"" Poirot asked. ""One must support one's friends,"" the other replied dryly. ""Especially when they are wrongly accused."" ""So you don't believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?"" I asked eagerly. ""Absolutely not. I know the boy. There have been a few things in this case that have completely baffled me, but still, despite his foolish way of handling it, I'll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer."" My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a burden from my heart. ""I'm sure many others share your belief,"" I exclaimed. ""There is ridiculously little evidence against him. I would say his acquittal is certain without a doubt."" But Stonor didn't seem as enthusiastic as I had hoped. ""I wish I could share your confidence,"" he said seriously. He turned to Poirot. ""What do you think, monsieur?"" ""I believe the situation looks grim for him,"" said Poirot calmly. ""You think he's guilty?"" Stonor asked sharply. ""No. But I think proving his innocence will be challenging."" ""He's behaving very strangely,"" muttered Stonor. ""Of course, I understand that there's much more to this case than meets the eye. Giraud hasn't grasped that because he's an outsider, but the whole thing has been very odd. Let's not dwell on it. If Mrs. Renauld wants to keep things quiet, I'll follow her lead. It's her decision, and I respect her judgment too much to interfere, but I can't understand Jack's attitude. You'd think he wanted people to believe he's guilty."" ""But that's absurd,"" I interjected. ""For one thing, the dagger..."" I paused, unsure of how much Poirot wanted me to reveal. I continued, picking my words carefully, ""We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld's possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld is aware of that."" ""True,"" said Stonor. ""Once she recovers, she will surely confirm all this and more. Well, I must be going."" ""Wait a moment."" Poirot's hand stopped him from leaving. ""Can you ensure that I am immediately informed if Madame Renauld regains consciousness?"" ""Of course. That can be arranged easily."" ""Your point about the dagger is valid, Poirot,"" I insisted as we climbed the stairs. ""I couldn't speak openly in front of Stonor."" ""You did the right thing. We might as well keep that information to ourselves for now. As for the dagger, your argument doesn't really help Jack Renauld. You remember I was absent for an hour this morning, before we departed from London?"" ""Yes?"" ""Well, I was busy trying to locate the company Jack Renauld hired to make his souvenirs. It wasn't very difficult. Well, Hastings, they produced not two paper-knives, but three at his request."" ""So that?"" ""So, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third that he likely kept for himself. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger issue won't assist us in saving him from the guillotine."" ""It won't come to that,"" I protested. Poirot shook his head doubtfully. ""You will save him,"" I stated confidently. Poirot looked at me dryly. ""Are you asking for miracles from me? Say no more. Let's see what this letter contains instead."" And he took out the envelope from his pocket and read, then handed the single sheet of paper to me.",1
"I eagerly sipped from the straw until the glass was drained. The cold liquid slid smoothly down my throat, satisfying my thirst. Seated on a high stool by the counter, I noticed my pursuer entering and taking a discreet seat at a nearby table. After finishing my second coffee soda, I ordered a maple soda, enjoying the sugary sweetness. I have a high tolerance for ice-cream sodas, and can consume them endlessly. Unexpectedly, the man stood up and left the establishment. Intrigued, I quietly slipped off my stool and approached the door.",1
"Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. Will you write to Cook’s today, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.” “I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Everyone was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.” “You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?” “No, doctor, I’m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you’ll see, something will turn up! You’ll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.” My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa’s London solicitor. He came down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it.",1
"""I see,"" said Poirot thoughtfully. ""It may be yes, it may be. But as yet I do not know! There is something very deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep."" Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture. We lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to present itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed maliciously: ""Eh bien! And your indiscretions! You recount them not?"" I felt myself blushing. ""Oh, you mean this morning?"" I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance. But I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so. ""Tiens! A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this charming young lady?"" I had to confess that I did not know. ""Still more romantic! The first rencontre in the train from Paris, the second here. Journeys end in lovers' meetings, is not that the saying?"" ""Don't be an ass, Poirot."" ""Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!"" ""It's all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely I don't mind admitting it. The other's nothing don't suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she's not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on."" ""Why?"" ""Well it sounds snobbish perhaps but she's not a lady, not in any sense of the word."" Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: ""You believe, then, in birth and breeding?"" ""I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don't believe in marrying out of one's class. It never answers."" ""I agree with you, mon ami. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again."" His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words ""Hôtel du Phare,"" and I heard again her voice saying ""Come and look me up"" and my own answering with empressement: ""I will."" Well, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had had time to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in cold blood, I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her intensely. I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her morbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again. I answered Poirot lightly enough. ""She asked me to look her up, but of course I shan't."" ""Why 'of course'?"" ""Well I don't want to."" ""I see.""",1
"""Would you dare to ask me that question once more, mademoiselle?"" ""What are you implying?"" ""If the question were posed again, my response would differ. Someone is under suspicion, but they are not Chilean."" ""Who?"" The question slipped quietly through her lips. ""Jack Renauld."" ""What?"" She exclaimed. ""Jack? That's impossible. Who would even dare to suspect him?"" ""Giraud."" ""Giraud!"" Her face turned pale. ""I fear that man. He is ruthless. He will he will "" She hesitated. But then a sense of bravery and resolve overtook her. In that moment, I recognized her as a fighter. Poirot, too, observed her closely.",1
"Upon showing Ridgeway’s card, we were escorted through a maze of counters and desks, maneuvering around clerks both taking and giving money, until we reached a small office on the second floor where we were greeted by the joint general managers. These two men were serious individuals, their years of service evident in their grey hair. One of them, Mr. Vavasour, sported a short white beard while the other, Mr. Shaw, was cleanly shaven. “I hear you specialize in discreet inquiries,” remarked Mr. Vavasour. “That is correct. We are also working closely with Scotland Yard on this matter. Inspector McNeil is overseeing the investigation, a highly skilled detective, as I understand it.”",1
"Lord Estair confirmed that the Prime Minister was under police protection, with his chauffeur being an Irishman from County Clare named O’Murphy. The Prime Minister's car deviated from the main road and was ambushed by masked men, but managed to escape with only a slight wound.

However, the police later found the Prime Minister's car parked outside a suspicious restaurant in Soho, known to be frequented by German agents.",1
"A man with a history of hunting lions in large numbers possesses an unfair advantage over his peers. It struck me that it was about time I shared a lion-related anecdote as well, albeit of a livelier nature. ""Speaking of which,"" I interjected, ""I recall a rather thrilling story I was told. A companion of mine was on a hunting expedition in East Africa. One evening, he exited his tent for a particular purpose and was taken aback by a faint growl. Upon a sudden turn, he found himself face to face with a lion ready to pounce. His firearm was left inside the tent. Acting swiftly, he dodged, causing the lion to leap over him. Irritated by the miss, the lion emitted a growl and readied itself for another leap.""",1
"Mrs. Renauld glanced at M. Hautet, awaiting his inquiry. ""You had a question for me, M. le juge."" ""If I may, madame. I gather your late husband hailed from French Canadian roots. Can you shed light on his early years or upbringing?"" She shook her head. ""My husband was quite reserved regarding his personal history, sir. He originated from the North West, but I suspect his childhood was fraught with difficulties, as he never broached the subject. Our focus was always on the here and now, looking towards the future."" ""Did he harbor any secrets from his past?"" Mrs. Renauld pondered, her expression unreadable.",1
"After enduring a nerve-racking crisis, she found herself facing the sea, a place she dreaded. With the enemy drawing closer each day, the situation seemed dire. Fortunately, her practical husband came to the rescue, unphased by her distress. Upon reaching England, she was left weak but alive. Poirot, with a serious expression, pointed out a flaw in the toast rack, exclaiming his disapproval. As I attempted to explain the shape of the toast, he dismissed my words with sarcasm. Reflecting on the lack of interesting cases, Poirot opened his letters, finding mostly bills. A note from Japp brought a slight glimmer of hope, thanking him for assistance in a past case.",1
"All I could think was, 'What's the point?' My friend was gone, with no one left to mourn him. I was meant to be gone too, so let it be. Living a quiet life now, devoid of joy or sorrow, numbed to the core. Looking back, I realize the war played a part in that. ""But then, out of nowhere, something jolted me back to reality. Guiding a group onto my boat for a river trip, I stood at the dock assisting them when one of the passengers gasped in shock. It drew my gaze to him.""",1
""" I felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot. “Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer needed.” Once outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise, he remarked: “I should rather like to see the room next door.” The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a large double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably, and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window. “The service leaves to be desired,” he observed dryly. He was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have fallen into a brown study. “Well?” I demanded impatiently. “What did we come in here for?” He started. “Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left, “it is bolted.” Poirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking. “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.” “But the maid did!” “Why do you say that?” “Why,” I stammered, “they were found actually in her mattress.” “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.” ""What?"" ""Imitation, mon ami."" The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!” ""Come!"" I cried, dragging at his arm. “Where?” “We must tell the Opalsens at once.” ""I think not."" ""But that poor woman"" ""Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe."" ""But the thief may escape with them!"" ""As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully tonight were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?"" ""Oh!"" I said, bewildered. ""Exactly,"" said Poirot, beaming. ""We start again."" He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness. ""Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen’s room."" The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife’s room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered. As she was about to depart Poirot detained her. ""One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen a card like this?"" He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully. ""No, sir, I can’t say I have. But, anyway, the valet has most to do with the gentlemen’s rooms."" ""I see. Thank you."" Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head. ""Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the valet."" I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents. In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again: “And the necklace was heavily insured. . . ."" ""Poirot,"" I cried, ""I see"" ""You see nothing, my friend,"" he replied quickly. ""As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments."" We did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot effected a rapid change of clothing. ""I go to London to-night,"" he explained. ""It is imperative."" ""What?"" ""Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!"" ""You’ll come a cropper one of these days,"" I observed, rather disgusted by his vanity. ""Do not be enraged, I beg of you, mon ami. I count on you to do me a service of your friendship."" ""Of course,"" I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. ""What is it?"" ""The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?"" ""No, I didn’t."" ""You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore false to all my principles."" ""But what was the powder?"" I asked, not particularly interested in Poirot’s principles. ""Not the poison of the Borgias,"" replied Poirot, with a twinkle. ""I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk."" ""French chalk?"" ""Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly."" I laughed. ""You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something exciting."" ""Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!"" The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush. The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel. In the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us, and it was past eight when I got back to the Grand Metropolitan. The first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more diminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in a state of placid satisfaction. “Mon ami Hastings!” he cried, and sprang to meet me. ""Embrace me, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!"" Luckily, the embrace was merely figurative not a thing one is always sure of with Poirot. ""Do you mean"" I began. ""Just wonderful, I call it!"" said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over her fat face. “Didn’t I tell you, Ed, that if he couldn’t get back my pearls nobody would?” “You did, my dear, you did. And you were right.” I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance. ""My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended."" ""Ended?"" ""But yes. They are arrested."" ""Who are arrested?"" ""The chambermaid and the valet, parbleu! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?"" ""You said cabinet-makers used it."" ""Certainly they do to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot. ""Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. Célestine leaves the room again, and pst! in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer. ""Madame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid a master stroke, ça!” “But what did you go to London for?” “You remember the card?” “Certainly. It puzzled me and puzzles me still. I thought” I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. “Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints. I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method” “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted. “But where did their ‘method’ break down?” “Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark” ""I remember,"" I cried. ""Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!"" There was a moment’s silence. “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me. ""This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed. “Pas du tout,” replied Poirot tranquilly. “Japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them. But” he tapped his pocket “I have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you, my friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we return here next week-end at my expense this time?” ""Now that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I think I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe. One evening after dinner I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation” was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand. I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. “Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England’s Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention. “In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!” He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a how do you call it? ‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.” I laughed. “At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.” “I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate MacAdam?” “Enfantillage!” replied Poirot promptly. “One can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.” “It was very near succeeding this time,” I reminded him. Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him. “They won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very important.” “Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain. “He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly.""",1
"""I still have a good amount of cash. Mrs. Flemming's twenty-five pounds is untouched, and I also won the sweepstakes yesterday, adding another fifteen pounds to my stash. I am sitting pretty with forty pounds!"" ""Forty pounds! Goodness!"" gasped Mrs. Blair. ""I couldn't do it, Anne, and I consider myself brave in my own way. I couldn't just set off cheerfully with a handful of coins and no plan of action or destination in mind."" ""But that's the thrill of it,"" I declared, feeling energized. ""It's the sense of adventure that makes it so exhilarating."" She gazed at me, nodded thoughtfully, and then broke into a smile. ""Lucky Anne! Not many share your outlook on life.""",1
"""The woman had been dead for about twenty-four hours, according to the police surgeon. Despite The Daily Budget's assumption that the man in the Tube was responsible for her murder and subsequent suicide, the timeline proved otherwise. The woman was alive at three o’clock, while the Tube victim was already dead by two o’clock. Therefore, it was clear that the two events were unrelated. The discovery of an address to view a house in Marlow in the dead man's pocket was simply a coincidence, a common occurrence in life.""",1
"“Did Renauld come by? I hold a great deal of respect and fondness for that woman; she’s an incredibly remarkable and unique individual, but I fail to see how my opinions, one way or another, could impact her?” “What if this Bella Duveen turns out to have been more than just a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” Stonor exclaimed. “I understand now. But I am willing to wager that you are mistaken. The old man never even glanced at another woman. He was completely devoted to his wife. They were the most loyal couple I have ever known.” M. Hautet shook his head subtly. “M. Stonor, we have concrete evidence of a love letter from this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of growing tired of her.”",1
"Poirot raised an eyebrow. ""You're missing the key detail here,"" he said, leaning back in his chair with a thoughtful expression. ""Lowen couldn't have been the one to force the safe, it's too obvious. The grudge against Davenheim is a red herring, a distraction from the real motive."" I glanced at him, puzzled. ""Then who do you think did it?"" Poirot smiled mysteriously. ""Ah, that is the question, isn't it? The answer lies in the details that everyone else overlooks."" And with that enigmatic statement, he got up and left the room, leaving me to ponder his words.",1
"""She triumphantly pulled it out from the pocket of her sweater. The sudden tilt of the boat caused her to lose her balance, and in her attempt to steady herself by grabbing the rail, the roll of films slipped over the side. Mrs. Blair exclaimed, 'Oh!' in a comical display of dismay. Peering over the edge, she asked, 'Do you think they've gone overboard?' 'No, you might have been lucky enough to accidentally hit an unfortunate steward on the deck below.' Unnoticed, a young boy standing a few steps behind us blew a loud blast on a bugle. 'Lunch time!' Mrs. Blair announced with excitement. 'I haven't eaten since breakfast, except for two cups of beef-tea. Are you joining me for lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?' 'Well,' I hesitated.""",1
"“I guess he had just managed to evade the foreign gentlemen, and my mother probably got the time wrong when they arrived. Or, was it all a setup after all? Did my mother really believe it couldn't have been me?” Poirot quickly reassured him. “No, no, Mr. Jack. Don't worry about that. I will clarify everything for you at some point. It's quite intriguing. But can you please tell us exactly what happened on that dreadful evening?” “There isn't much to say. I had come from Cherbourg, as I mentioned, to see Marthe before leaving for a faraway place. The train was delayed, so I took the shortcut through the golf course.”",1
"An incredible change had overtaken my companion. His eyes sparkled with anticipation, his chest expanded with pride. ""I've been foolish, my companions! But now I see the light."" Major Norman hurried to the exit. ""I'll fetch the car."" ""That won't be necessary. I won't be using it. Thankfully, the storm has passed."" ""Are you planning to walk, sir?"" ""No, my dear friend. I am not St. Peter. I choose to voyage across the ocean by ship."" ""Across the ocean?"" ""Indeed. To proceed systematically, one must start from the beginning. And the genesis of this case was in England. Therefore, we must return to England.""",1
"Three deaths linger as a dark omen over the unfolding events in Egypt. Lady Willard expresses her deep fear for her son, who is determined to continue his father's work amidst the lurking shadows of the past. Poirot, surprisingly superstitious, vows to protect the young man from any unseen harm. The mysterious deaths of Mr. Bleibner and Mr. Schneider raise suspicions of foul play, leading Poirot and Hastings to embark on a journey to uncover the truth. As they delve deeper into the secrets of the expedition, they encounter a web of deceit and danger that threatens to consume them all.",1
"I was relieved when the man, Chichester, and the Dutchman left the house. I waited for a while before making my move. The hall was empty, so I quickly unlatched the door and stepped outside into the sunshine. I ran down the drive and headed towards Cape Town. After a short while, I reached a garage and asked for a car to take me to catch the boat to Durban. I had to find out if Chichester was on board. As I drove towards the docks, I realized that the Kilmorden Castle was already sailing away. My only hope was to sail after him and confront him about the diamonds. I decided to sail to Durban and see what awaited me there.",1
"“Indeed, Renauld, it is unfortunately true! A perfect little weapon, I suspect. Sleek and simple to wield.” “Where is it located? Can I have a look at it? Is it still inside the corpse?” “Oh, no, it had already been extracted. You desire to examine it? Just to confirm? It would be wise, I believe, even though madame has already recognized it. But M. Bex, could I ask you?” “Of course, M. le juge. I will retrieve it promptly.” “Might it not be preferable to bring M. Renauld to the barn?” proposed Giraud smoothly. “Undoubtedly he would want to see his father’s remains.",1
"""We positioned ourselves on the grassy hill as Poirot advised, gazing towards the ocean. In the distance, the sounds of swimmers could be heard faintly. The sea glistened with the lightest shade of blue, evoking memories of our arrival in Merlinville and Poirot's teasing remark about my demeanor. It felt like ages had passed, though only three days had gone by. ""Focus, my dear,"" Poirot urged. ""Organize your thoughts. Approach this methodically and systematically. That is the key to triumph.""",1
"“He scrutinized me intently for a few minutes. “Indeed. I understand perfectly. And you are wise. Stick to your story.” “That seems to be your consistent advice,” I noted, somewhat annoyed. “Ah, my friend, trust in Papa Poirot. One day, if you allow me, I will arrange a highly suitable marriage for you.” “Thank you,” I chuckled, “but the idea doesn’t excite me.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “The English!” he muttered. “No method, absolutely none. They leave everything to chance!” He furrowed his brow and adjusted the position of the salt cellar. “You mentioned that Miss Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre, didn’t you?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “Right, I forgot.” A brief moment of doubt crossed my mind. Had I ever disclosed any hotel information to Poirot? I glanced at him and felt reassured. He was meticulously cutting his bread into small squares, completely engrossed in his task. He must have assumed that I had informed him of the girl’s whereabouts. We had coffee outdoors, with a view of the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, then retrieved his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris departs at 2:25,” he remarked. “I should be on my way.” “Paris?” I exclaimed. “Exactly what I said, mon ami.” “You’re going to Paris? But why?” He replied gravely. “To find the killer of Mr. Renauld.” “You believe he is in Paris?” “I am absolutely certain he is not. However, that is where I must search for him. You don’t understand, but I will explain it all in due course. Trust me, this trip to Paris is imperative. I won’t be gone long. Most likely, I’ll be back tomorrow. I don’t suggest you accompany me. Stay here and keep an eye on Giraud. Also, spend time with Mr. Renauld’s son. And if you wish, try to win over Miss Marthe. But I doubt you’ll be successful.” I didn’t quite appreciate his last comment. “That reminds me,” I said. “I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?” “My friend, I understand human nature. Put together a young boy like Renauld and a beautiful girl like Miss Marthe, and the outcome is nearly inevitable. Then, the quarrel! Money or a woman, and recalling Léonie’s description of the lad’s rage, I opted for the latter. So I made my assumption, and I was correct.” “And that’s why you warned me against getting attached to the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?” Poirot smiled. “At the very least, I noticed she had anxious eyes. That’s how I always think of Miss Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes…” His tone was so serious that it made me uneasy. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I believe, my friend, that we will see soon enough. But I must leave.” “You have plenty of time.” “Perhaps perhaps. But I prefer to be leisurely at the station. I don’t want to rush, to hurry, to get worked up.” “In any case,” I said, standing up, “I’ll come see you off.” “You will do no such thing. I forbid it.” He was so firm that I gaped at him in surprise. He nodded decisively. “I’m serious, mon ami. Goodbye! May I hug you? Ah, no, I forget that it’s not the English custom. A handshake, then.” I felt somewhat lost after Poirot departed. I ambled down the beach, observing the swimmers, but lacking the energy to join them. I half expected Cinderella to be frolicking amongst them in a stunning outfit, but I saw no trace of her. I wandered aimlessly along the shoreline towards the far end of the town. It struck me that, in the end, it would be the right thing to do to inquire about the girl. And it would prevent future complications. The matter could then be settled. I wouldn’t need to worry about her anymore. But, if I didn’t go at all, she might very well come looking for me at the Villa. And that would be bothersome in every way. Certainly, it would be best to pay a brief visit, during which I could make it clear that I could no longer assist her as a guide. Therefore, I left the beach and headed inland. I quickly found the Hôtel du Phare, a modest building. It was incredibly frustrating not to know the lady’s name, and to save face, I chose to enter and explore. Perhaps I’d find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small town, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. A Casino was under construction, but it wasn’t finished yet. I had walked the length of the beach without spotting her, so she had to be in the hotel. I went inside. Several people were seated in the tiny lounge, but she wasn’t among them. I peeked into a few other rooms, but she was nowhere to be seen. After waiting for a while, impatience got the better of me. I pulled the concierge aside and slipped five francs into his hand. “I need to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, petite and dark-haired. I’m not certain of her name.” The man shook his head, seemingly trying to stifle a grin. “There’s no lady here matching your description.” “Maybe she’s American,” I suggested. These fellows are so dim-witted. But the man kept shaking his head. “No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies in total, and they are all much older than the lady you’re looking for. She’s not here, monsieur.” He was so certain that I began to doubt myself. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have been mistaken, or more likely, the lady was, since another gentleman has been here inquiring about her.” “What did he look like?” “He was a small gentleman, well-dressed, very neat, very immaculate, with a very stiff mustache, a peculiarly shaped head, and green eyes.” Poirot! So that’s why he didn’t want me to go with him to the station.”",1
"Mrs. Renauld descended the stairs, supported by Léonie, her head bandaged. The French girl pleaded with her to return to bed, fearing for her well-being. Mrs. Renauld, however, pushed forward, disowning Jack and accusing him of his father's death. Jack, shocked and confused, was helped to the Villa Marguerite where he was attended to by a doctor. Poirot and I, hungry and tired, secured rooms at the Hôtel des Bains for the night. There, we met Miss Robinson, who had a mysterious task for Poirot. Despite her insistence on joining us, we set out on a night mission to the Villa Geneviève. On our way back, we checked on Jack's condition at the Villa Marguerite, where we encountered Madame Daubreuil and observed Jack's troubled sleep.",1
"""His words seemed to lack clarity, filling me with uneasiness. However, his demeanor was that of normalcy. Abruptly, he got up and casually walked over to the window. ""There he is,"" he remarked. ""Who?"" I inquired. ""M. Jack Renauld. I sent a message to the Villa requesting his presence here."" This revelation shifted my thoughts, prompting me to question Poirot about Jack Renauld's presence in Merlinville on the night of the crime. Hoping to outsmart my clever companion, I was disappointed to find that he was already aware. Just like me, he had checked at the station. ""It seems we are not the only ones with this idea, Hastings. The admirable Giraud has likely done the same.""",1
"""His persuasion led me to switch allegiance."" Sir Eustace glanced his way. He remained silent, yet Minks appeared to visibly crumble. ""Rats deserting a sinking ship,"" noted Sir Eustace. ""I despise rats. Sooner or later, I exterminate pests."" ""There's something I must disclose, Sir Eustace,"" I interjected. ""The tin you tossed out the window didn't hold the diamonds. It contained ordinary pebbles. The diamonds are securely hidden. In truth, they reside in the large giraffe's belly.""",1
"The doorbell rang, prompting Jeanne to answer it. She returned holding a card. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer lazily reached for the card, but upon reading the name “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a spark of interest ignited in her eyes. “I will see him. Jeanne, fetch the maize peignoir quickly. And when the Count arrives, you may leave.” “Of course, Madame.” Jeanne brought the peignoir, a delicate blend of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, smiling to herself as she sat down, tapping a slow rhythm on the dressing-table with one long white hand. The Count wasted no time in taking advantage of the invitation extended to him - a man of average height, slender, graceful, pallid, and remarkably fatigued.",1
"""Pagett was positive it was Rayburn?” His conviction was unwavering. “There’s something odd going on,” he remarked. “First off, where’s Rayburn?” It’s a fact that he’s been missing since we arrived on shore. He never made it to the hotel with us. I doubt he’s scared of Pagett, though. The whole situation is frustrating. One secretary has disappeared without a trace, and the other is a mess. I can’t have him out and about with me like this. It would ruin my reputation. I have a meeting later today to deliver old Milray’s letter, but Pagett won’t be joining me. I can’t stand his lurking behavior. I’m in a foul mood. My breakfast was terrible, served by unpleasant waitresses. And the early morning doctor’s appointment after our arrival is simply exhausting. Later on, a serious issue arose. I took Milray’s sealed letter to my meeting with the Prime Minister, only to find a blank sheet inside. Now, I’m in a mess. Why did I let Milray involve me in this? Pagett, with his black eye, seems oddly satisfied at my misfortune. He even managed to pass me the stationery trunk. He’s treading a thin line. In the end, I had to hear Pagett out. “What if, Sir Eustace, Rayburn overheard your conversation with Mr. Milray in the street? You accepted Rayburn based solely on his word,” he pointed out. “Do you think Rayburn is a criminal?” I inquired. Pagett certainly did. His resentment was palpable. He built a convincing case against Rayburn. My plan was to stay out of it. No one likes being made a fool of. But Pagett, with his energy undiminished, was all for taking action. He rushed off to the police station, sent numerous cables, and brought a horde of officials to my expense. Later that evening, we received Milray’s response. He knew nothing about my former secretary! The only solace was that Pagett wasn’t poisoned, just suffering from a usual ailment. I saw him flinch. Pagett is convinced that Rayburn is the infamous “Man in the Brown Suit.” He’s probably right, though the situation is becoming unpleasant. I need to leave for Rhodesia soon. I made it clear to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You must stay here,” I told him. “Your help may be needed to identify Rayburn. And I can’t be seen with a secretary who’s recently been involved in a brawl.” Pagett winced. He’s so proper that his appearance is a burden. “But what about your correspondence and notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” he asked. “I’ll manage,” I replied casually. “Your private car will be ready for the eleven-o’clock train tomorrow morning,” Pagett informed me. “All arrangements have been made. Is Mrs. Blair bringing a maid?” “Mrs. Blair?” I was taken aback. She told me I offered her a place. Delightful as she is, I’m not sure I want her company all the way to Rhodesia. Women demand a lot of attention. “Did I invite anyone else?” I asked nervously. I must have been quite drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed. “Don’t get drunk again,” I advised Pagett. “I never touch alcohol, Sir Eustace,” he assured me. “I haven’t invited anyone else, have I?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I breathed a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I mused. “She wants to go to Rhodesia to dig up bones. I might offer her a temporary job as a secretary. She can type, she mentioned.” Surprisingly, Pagett vehemently objected. He has a strong dislike for Anne Beddingfeld. Since the incident with the black eye, he gets emotional whenever she’s mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries these days. Just to irritate him, I’ll ask the girl. She does have nice legs.",1
"""It shatters my hypothesis; it devastates everything... no!"" He suddenly halted, hitting his chest. ""It's inconceivable. I can't be mistaken! The evidence, approached systematically and in the correct sequence, only allows for one interpretation. I must be correct! I am correct!"" ""But then..."" I began. He cut me off. ""Wait, my dear. I must be correct, therefore this recent homicide is implausible unless unless oh, hold on, I beg of you. Don't say a word."" After a brief pause, he returned to his usual demeanor, speaking calmly and confidently: ""The deceased is a middle-aged man.""",1
"No trace of her throughout the day. Anxiety crept up on me. But then, as evening descended, a newspaper delivered the shocking news. ""It was horrifying! I couldn't be certain, yet I felt a deep sense of dread. My theory was that Bella had encountered Papa Renauld and spilled the beans about her relationship with Jack, leading to some kind of altercation. We're both known for our fiery tempers."" As details about the mysterious masked figure emerged, my unease began to subside. However, the fact that Bella stood me up continued to trouble me. The following morning, in a state of agitation, I felt compelled to investigate. And that's when our paths crossed.",1
"As Pagett made sure to wait until he had eliminated any suspicious activities, I decided to board a tram out of the city and take a leisurely stroll in the countryside. The weather was pleasantly cool, providing a welcome relief after my confined travels and time spent at Muizenberg. It's funny how seemingly insignificant details can have a big impact - like when my shoelace suddenly came undone, causing me to stop and bend down to tie it. Just as I was fixing my shoe, a man turned the corner and nearly collided with me. He quickly tipped his hat, offered a brief apology, and continued on his way.",1
"As Ned greeted Harry and the dripping female, he provided them with food, hot coffee, and dry clothes. Meanwhile, he discreetly inquired about Sir Eustace's party at the hotel. Anne firmly refused to go to Beira, fearing for her safety now that her enemies knew she was alive. Instead, she planned to join Suzanne and wait for further instructions. The diamonds were to be stored in the Bank under the name of Parker. To avoid deception, any genuine messages from Harry would have the word 'and' crossed out, and wires signed 'Andy.' Despite the chaos, Anne jokingly asked Harry about marrying someone else, to which he threatened to wring the other man's neck. Anne teased Harry about his unpredictability, highlighting their playful banter.",1
"Why didn't he just speak up? Was he worried about his past relationship with Marthe Daubreuil coming to light? I couldn't help but feel frustrated. It was just a harmless teenage romance, and I couldn't believe that the son of a millionaire would be dumped by a French girl who loved him. There had to be something more to it. The whole situation was confusing and left me feeling uneasy. I didn't want to be involved in tracking down this girl with Poirot, but I couldn't think of a way out without revealing everything to him, which I wasn't ready to do for some unknown reason.",1
"""New York!"" ""Lucy,"" I replied, ""soon you'll be tired of California and excitement."" ""I could use a fancy new pair of shoes,"" Lucy confessed longingly. ""Should I join you to see Jack Thompson tomorrow?"" ""I'd rather go by myself. He's more comfortable talking one-on-one,"" I explained. And that's how I found myself outside the cafe the next day, wrestling with an uncooperative umbrella that just wouldn't open, while Lucy lounged on the sofa with a magazine and a cup of tea.",1
"""Guess what? I'll clear my name or die trying. The scoundrel who tried to murder you will pay,"" he vowed. ""He didn't push you, but he deceived you. Stones on the path were moved, luring you to step into nothingness. I'll find him,"" he promised. Then, in a different tone, he opened up about his past. ""My real name is Harry Lucas,"" he confessed. Raised in Rhodesia, he met Eardsley at Cambridge, bonding over a love for South Africa. Together, they found diamonds in British Guiana, but Anita Grünberg's betrayal led to their downfall. The police seized the diamonds, and Eardsley's influence couldn't save them.""",1
"We raced to Cape Town as soon as possible. Suzanne greeted me there, and together we dismantled the giraffe. Colonel Race suggested we move into Sir Lawrence Eardsley's villa at Muizenberg. Plans were made for me to return to England with Suzanne, getting married in London with the trousseau from Paris. Suzanne loved planning, but the future felt unreal. The night before we sailed, Harry appeared, urging me to run away with him to Rhodesia. I followed him, feeling like a lunatic in love. It's been two years since then, living on the island. Suzanne wrote a letter, calling us lunatics. Another letter arrived from Bolivia, offering me a diary to use as I please. I may now be Lady Eardsley, but the past still haunts me.",1
"He used to be a beachcomber and a remittance man on various South Sea islands before coming back to New York two years ago, where he quickly spiraled downwards. What struck me the most was that he recently acquired enough money to travel to Egypt. ""I have a friend there who can lend me some,"" he confidently stated. However, his plans took a turn for the worse. He returned to New York, bitterly cursing his miserly uncle who valued ancient kings' bones more than his own family. It was while he was in Egypt that Sir John Willard met his demise.",1
"I implored her to confide in me. Unbeknownst to many, the depth of their affection had been put to the ultimate test and emerged unscathed. Both had shown a willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for one another."" As for the modest chronicler Captain Arthur Hastings, what fate awaited him? Rumors circulated about his potential departure to join the Renaulds on a distant ranch, but for the conclusion of this tale, I choose to revisit a morning in the peaceful garden of Villa Geneviève. ""It feels strange to address you as Bella,"" I remarked, ""knowing that it is not your given name. And Dulcie, well, it feels equally foreign.""",1
"The local investigators have scoured the area for any clues. Every possible effort is being made, yet Anne Beddingfeld remains missing. The prevailing belief is that she wandered in a sleep-like state. Traces along the trail by the bridge suggest a deliberate step off the cliff. If true, her fate would have been a tragic fall onto the jagged rocks beneath. Regrettably, the majority of the tracks were erased by a group of sightseers who passed through that morning. This explanation leaves much to be desired.",1
"I refrained from questioning Poirot about our destination in the presence of our captive, struggling to glean any insight into the situation. We arrived at a modest house set back from the road. A tipsy passerby staggered along the sidewalk, nearly bumping into Poirot, who uttered something sternly to him, the words escaping me. The three of us ascended the house's steps. Poirot pressed the doorbell and gestured for us to step back. Silence followed, prompting Poirot to ring the bell again before resorting to knocking loudly. A light flickered on above the door, which cautiously opened a crack.",1
"""You will have a Military officer and a C.I.D. man by your side, ready to assist you in any way. Does that meet your requirements?"" ""Certainly. Before you go, gentlemen, may I ask why you chose to seek me out? I am but a stranger in this vast city of London."" ""We were directed to you by a prominent figure from your homeland, based on his strong recommendation."" ""Ah, my dear old friend the Préfet?"" Lord Estair shook his head. ""Someone even higher than the Préfet. A figure of great authority in Belgium, whose power will be restored! An oath that England has taken!"" Poirot's hand swiftly rose in a dramatic salute.",1
"“I couldn’t risk losing my position. A secretary like me isn’t supposed to have a spouse, so I kept it hidden.” “You surprise me,” I commented. “Where has she been all this time?” “We’ve had a small cottage by the river in Marlow, near the Mill House, for more than five years.” “Goodness gracious,” I muttered. “Do you have any children?” “Four children, Sir Eustace.” I stared at him in disbelief. I should have realized that someone like Pagett wouldn’t harbor a dark secret. Pagett’s respectable image has always been a thorn in my side.”",1
"Since the conclusion of the Conflict, he had resided in at least half a dozen various apartments and townhouses. Almost immediately after settling in a new place, he would stumble upon a different opportunity and promptly move out. Most of his relocations resulted in a small financial profit, showcasing his astute business acumen. However, his primary motivation was the thrill of the chase rather than monetary gain. As we absorbed Parker's words, we were filled with admiration for his expertise. When it was our chance to speak, a chaotic exchange of words ensued. Eventually, Mrs. was the last one standing.",1
"I will disclose everything. A man in Italy with a high position had obtained certain information that this scoundrel wanted. He asked for a large sum of money in exchange for the documents. I traveled to England to settle the matter. I met with him as scheduled that morning. A young secretary from the Embassy accompanied me. The Count was more reasonable than expected, but the amount of money I handed over was substantial."" ""Excuse me, how was it given?"" ""In Italian notes of small denominations. I handed over the money on the spot. He gave me the incriminating documents. That was the last time I saw him."" ""Why didn't you mention all this when you were arrested?"" ""Given my fragile situation, I had to deny any connection with the man."" ""And how do you explain the events of that evening?"" ""It seems someone must have impersonated me. I heard there was no money found in the apartment."" Poirot gazed at him and shook his head. ""Curious,"" he whispered. ""We all possess the little grey cells. Yet, so few know how to utilize them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. Your story aligns with my thoughts. However, I needed to confirm."" After seeing his visitor out, Poirot returned to his armchair and grinned at me. ""Let's hear Captain Hastings's thoughts on the case?"" ""Well, I guess Ascanio is correct, someone impersonated him."" ""You will never use the intelligence bestowed upon you. Recall my words after leaving the flat that night. I mentioned the undrawn window curtains. It's June, still bright at eight, darkening by half-past. Does that ring a bell? I sense a faint realization forming within you. Now, let's proceed. The coffee was black, Foscatini's teeth pristine white. Coffee stains teeth. We deduce Foscatini didn't drink coffee. Yet, all three cups had coffee. Why fake Foscatini had coffee when he didn't?"" I shook my head, utterly perplexed. ""Let me assist you. What proof do we have that Ascanio and his friend, or two imposters, were at the flat that night? No one saw them enter or leave. We rely on one man and inanimate objects for evidence."" ""You mean?"" ""I mean knives, forks, plates, and dirty dishes. Graves is a thief and scoundrel, yet so methodical! He overheard enough that morning to know Ascanio would struggle to defend himself. The next evening, around eight, he lured Foscatini to the telephone and attacked him from behind with a marble figure. Then, he arranged a fake dinner for three! He served, dirtied plates and cutlery, but had to dispose of the food. He even ate three tournedos, struggling with the rice soufflé. He smoked to maintain the charade. He moved the clock's hands to 8:47, smashed it, and left. He mentioned guests to the lift operator and called the doctor at 8:47. It was so successful no one questioned a call from Flat II at that time."" ""Except Hercule Poirot, I presume?"" I remarked sarcastically. ""Not even Hercule Poirot,"" my friend replied with a smile. ""I will verify now. I had to convince you first. Japp, tipped off, will arrest Graves. I wonder how much of the money he's spent."" Poirot was correct, as always. The puzzle brought by Miss Violet Marsh was a welcome change. She sent a note asking for an appointment, and Poirot agreed to meet her the next day at eleven. She arrived promptly, a tall, attractive woman with a confident demeanor. She began, ""My story starts with my father, an orphan from a poor farming family in Devonshire.""",1
"""Welcome back from England, M. Poirot,"" he said casually. ""The case is nearing its end, isn't it?"" Poirot nodded, his demeanor subdued. ""I believe so,"" he replied. The other man, clearly pleased with Poirot's demeanor, commented on the lack of resistance from the suspect. ""It is quite remarkable,"" Poirot agreed, his tone mild. But his companion was already preoccupied with his cane, bidding Poirot farewell and expressing satisfaction with the resolution of the case.",1
"“Please forgive me, my dear friend. Her hand covered the area where the gap would have been visible. It is simple to place a piece of silk in the door in advance! When Rolf learned of the theft, he orchestrated his own little performance. And he played it quite well!” “What did you tell him?” I inquired with great curiosity. “I informed him that Lady Yardly had confessed everything to her husband, that I had the authority to retrieve the jewel, and if it was not returned immediately, legal action would be taken. I also added a few more white lies that came to mind. He was completely under my spell!” I contemplated the situation. “It seems rather unfair to Mary Marvell. She lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” Poirot exclaimed bluntly. “She sees it as excellent publicity. That is all that matters to her! Now the other woman, she is different. Good mother, very feminine!” “Yes,” I responded uncertainly, not entirely agreeing with Poirot's opinions on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the forged letters.” “Not at all,” Poirot replied briskly. “She sought my help on the advice of Mary Cavendish. Then she discovered that Mary Marvell, whom she considered her rival, had visited me, and she changed her mind, seizing the opportunity that you, my friend, provided her with. A few simple questions revealed that it was you who mentioned the letters to her, not the other way around! She eagerly seized the chance your words presented.” “I don't believe it,” I protested, feeling stung. “Yes, yes, my friend, you should pay more attention to psychology. Did she tell you the letters were destroyed? Oh, dear me, a woman never destroys a letter if she can help it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!” “It's all too much,” I exclaimed, my frustration mounting. “You've made a complete fool out of me! From start to finish! No, it's easy to try and justify it afterwards. There is a limit!” “But you were having such a good time, my friend. I couldn't bring myself to ruin your enjoyment.” “It's pointless. You've crossed the line this time.” “Good Lord! Why do you get so worked up over nothing, my friend?” “I'm done!” I stormed out, slamming the door behind me. Poirot had turned me into a total laughingstock. I decided that he needed to learn a lesson. I would wait some time before forgiving him. He had egged me on to make a fool of myself! I had to leave town for a few days, and upon my return, I found Poirot packing his small suitcase. “Just in time, Hastings. I was afraid you wouldn't make it back in time to accompany me.” “You're leaving for a case, then?” “Yes, although I must admit that, on the surface, this investigation doesn't seem very promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company has requested that I look into the death of a Mr. Maltravers, who recently insured his life with them for a hefty sum of fifty thousand pounds.” “Interesting,” I remarked.",1
"""Finding the murder of Nadina pinned on me will be impossible. I was in Marlow that day, and that's all you have. No one can prove I even knew her. But you, you had a motive and your criminal history speaks for itself. You're a thief, remember that. What you don't know is that I have the diamonds. And now watch this."" With a swift motion, he bent down, raised his arm and tossed the object through the window. The sound of shattering glass filled the room as it disappeared into the fiery glow outside. ""There goes your chance to prove your innocence in the Kimberley case. Now, let's make a deal. You've trapped me. Race will find all the evidence he needs in this house. I might have a shot at escape. If I stay, I'm finished, and so are you. There's a skylight in the next room. Give me a head start, and I'll leave you a confession that I killed Nadina."" ""Yes, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He turned to me with a stern look. ""No, Anne, not in a thousand lifetimes. You don't know what you're saying."" ""I do. It's the solution to everything."" ""I could never face Race again. I'll take my chances, but I won't let this sly old fox slip away. It's no use, Anne. I won't do it."" Sir Eustace chuckled, accepting defeat casually. ""Well, well,"" he said. ""It seems you've met your match, Anne. But let me tell you, moral righteousness doesn't always pay off."" Suddenly, the sound of splintering wood filled the room, followed by footsteps thundering up the stairs. Harry unlatched the door. Colonel Race burst in first, relieved to see us. ""You're safe, Anne. I was worried,"" he said. Turning to Sir Eustace, he added, ""I've been chasing you for a long time, Pedler, and finally, I've caught you."" ""It appears everyone has lost their minds,"" Sir Eustace said lightly. ""These young ones have been threatening me with guns and accusing me of all sorts of things. I have no idea what's going on."" ""Don't you? It means I've found the 'Colonel.' It means on January 8th, you were in Marlow, not Cannes. It means when Nadina turned against you, you planned her demise. The truth will come out at last."" ""Is that so? And who told you all this? The man the police are currently searching for? His testimony will be quite valuable."" ""We have other evidence. There is someone else who knew Nadina was meeting you at the Mill House."" Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race gestured to Arthur Minks, also known as the Rev. Edward Chichester, also known as Miss Pettigrew. He stepped forward, pale and nervous, but with a steady voice: ""I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she left for England. I was posing as a Russian Count. She confided in me about her plans. I warned her about the man she was dealing with, but she didn't listen. There was a wireless message on the table, and I saw it.""",1
"""I rushed to offer my own perspective. 'You have faith in the triumph of this Uprising? You've committed fully.' 'For someone as intelligent as you are, that's a remarkably foolish comment. No, my dear, I do not have faith in this Uprising. I predict it will die down disgracefully in a couple of days.' 'Not a victory for you, then?' I remarked harshly. 'Just like all women, you lack an understanding of business. The task I undertook was to deliver specific explosives and weapons for a hefty sum to stir up general unrest, and to fully implicate certain individuals.'""",1
"“Ah, what an idea! You saw me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Well, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Combine those facts with another, that M. Jack Renauld rushed out of the house on his way to Paris, and tell me what you think!” “I understand,” I replied slowly, as Poirot’s words sank in. “That letter was meant for Jack Renauld, not his father. He mistakenly took the wrong overcoat in his haste and anxiety.” Poirot nodded. “Exactly! We can revisit this later.",1
"""He's deceiving me,"" I mused. ""But for what reason?"" ""Has your employer leased the residence? Have there been any unfamiliar faces inside over the past three years?"" ""Negative, sir."" ""Any guests?"" ""Just Miss Violet."" ""No unfamiliar individuals have set foot in this chamber?"" ""None, sir."" ""You're overlooking the laborers, Jim,"" his spouse pointed out. ""Laborers?"" Poirot snapped at her. ""What laborers?"" The lady disclosed that approximately two and a half years ago, workers had been present to perform specific repairs. She was rather unclear on the nature of the repairs. Her belief was that it was a mere whim of her employer's and completely unnecessary.",1
"The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet.",1
"Suzanne's enthusiasm was lacking, having traveled extensively. She was not one to get excited before breakfast. When I expressed my excitement at spotting a giant blue convolvulus, she snubbed me harshly. Just to clarify, this story will not be set in South Africa. I won't promise any authentic local color with italicized words on every page. While I admire it, I simply cannot replicate it. In the South Sea Islands, however, a mention of bêche-de-mer is always appropriate.",1
"I waited impatiently for what felt like an eternity before deciding to take matters into my own hands. Casually slipping a few bills into the concierge's hand, I inquired about a mysterious woman I was searching for. Describing her as a petite, dark-haired English lady, I was met with a puzzled expression. ""Perhaps she is American?"" I ventured, growing frustrated with the man's lack of cooperation. Despite my efforts, the concierge insisted that such a woman was not a guest at the hotel.",1
"The final response, conversely, is the cornerstone of my hypothesis.” I threw my hands up in defeat. “I surrender.” While traveling to London by train, Poirot wrote diligently for a brief period, sealing the outcome in an envelope. “This is for Inspector McNeil. We will drop it off at Scotland Yard on our way, and then head to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where Miss Esmée Farquhar has graciously agreed to join us for dinner.” “And Ridgeway?” “What of him?” inquired Poirot with a gleam in his eye.",1
"""He attempted to flee, but I was one step ahead. He's now in custody for the killing of his father, M. Paul Renauld."" Poirot turned sharply towards the young man, who was slouched against the wall, his complexion drained of color. ""Any words, jeune homme?"" Jack Renauld gazed back at him expressionless. ""None,"" he replied. I was taken aback. Until that moment, I couldn't accept Jack Renauld's guilt. I anticipated a vehement denial of the accusations when Poirot confronted him.",1
"""Listen, I'm not naive, sir. I can face the truth head-on. He's innocent, and we need to help him,"" she declared with determination, pausing briefly to reflect. Poirot studied her closely and asked, ""Is there something you're holding back, something that could be important for us to know?"" She hesitated before admitting, ""Yes, there is something, but it's so unbelievable that I'm not sure you'll take it seriously."" ""Please, go on,"" urged Poirot. ""Well, M. Giraud called me in at the last minute to see if I could identify the man inside,"" she revealed, gesturing towards the shed.",1
"As Sir Eustace paused mid-sentence, Miss Pettigrew, though efficient in appearance, startled at his sudden halt. “God bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “What of the man in Durban?” “I choose you,” I murmured. “My dear,” Sir Eustace whispered. “You may hold my hand now.” At once, Miss Pettigrew cleared her throat, causing Sir Eustace to retract his hand abruptly. “Ah, yes,” he continued. “Where were we? Ah, yes. Tylman Roos, during his speech...Why are you not jotting this down?” Colonel Race interjected gently, “I believe Miss Pettigrew's pencil has snapped.”",1
"""As for your inquiry, I am truly clueless."" ""Could you investigate?"" inquired Poirot persistently. ""Certainly, if you truly wish to know."" ""Thank you, my friend. I would appreciate it if you could look into it."" Japp gazed at him for a few more minutes, but Poirot appeared to have forgotten about us both. The detective sadly shook his head at me, and whispered, ""Poor old chap! The war has taken its toll on him!"" before gently exiting the room. While Poirot remained lost in thought, I grabbed a piece of paper and entertained myself by jotting down some notes. My companion's voice snapped me out of it. He had snapped out of his trance and looked lively and sharp.",1
"""You’re youthful, Anne, and possess a striking beauty that drives men to madness. The world lies ahead of you, filled with love, life, and endless possibilities. Whereas mine is a scorched wasteland, tainted with bitter ashes.” “If you no longer desire me” “You know I crave you. I would willingly sacrifice my soul to hold you in my arms and shelter you from the world forever. Anne, you are a temptation. Your enchanting witch-like hair, your eyes that shimmer with golden, brown, and green hues, always laughing even when your expression is serious. However, I will protect you from both yourself and me. You must leave tonight.""",1
"""I'd rather be dead than tough,"" I declared with fervor. We climbed into the vehicle and began our journey. Slowly, I composed myself once more. Unexpectedly, he grasped my hand. ""Anne,"" he murmured softly, ""I desire you. Will you marry me?"" I was completely caught off guard. ""Oh, no,"" I stuttered. ""I cannot."" ""Why not?"" ""I do not have feelings for you in that way. I have never considered you in that light."" ""I understand. Is that the only reason?"" I had to be truthful. I owed him that much. ""No,"" I replied, ""it is not. You see, I care for someone else."" ""I see,"" he repeated, his voice now carrying a sense of purpose that made me turn to look at him. His expression was more severe than I had ever seen it. ""What do you mean?"" I faltered. He gazed at me, inscrutable and commanding. ""Just that I now know what I must do."" His words sent a chill through me. There was a determination in them that unsettled me. We remained silent until we arrived back at the hotel. I went straight to Suzanne. She was sprawled on her bed, engrossed in a book, showing no signs of a headache. ""Here lies the perfect third wheel,"" she quipped. ""Also known as the tactful chaperone. Anne dear, what's wrong?"" I burst into tears. I confided in her about the cats but avoided mentioning Colonel Race. Suzanne is perceptive. I believe she sensed that there was more to the story. ""You haven't caught a cold, have you, Anne? It sounds ridiculous to even suggest such a thing in this heat, but you keep shivering."" ""It's nothing,"" I insisted. ""Just nerves or a feeling of impending doom. I keep sensing that something terrible is about to occur."" ""Don't be silly,"" Suzanne retorted firmly. ""Let's discuss something more interesting. Anne, about those diamonds..."" ""What about them?"" ""I'm not convinced they're safe with me. It was fine before, no one would suspect they were among my belongings. But now that everyone knows how close we are, you and I, I'll come under scrutiny as well."" ""No one knows they're hidden in a roll of film,"" I argued. ""It's a clever hiding spot and I doubt we could find a better one."" She reluctantly agreed, suggesting we revisit the topic when we reached the Falls. Our departure was scheduled for nine o'clock. Sir Eustace's temper had not improved, and Miss Pettigrew seemed subdued. Colonel Race appeared unchanged. I felt as though the entire conversation on the way back had been a dream. That night, I slept deeply on my uncomfortable bunk, wrestling with vague, menacing dreams. When I woke up with a headache, I stepped out onto the observation platform of the car. The air was crisp and delightful, with rolling wooded hills as far as the eye could see. I adored it, more than any other place I had ever been. In that moment, I wished I could have a little cabin tucked away in the heart of the bush and reside there forever. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race summoned me from the ""office"" and pointed out a bouquet-shaped mist that hung over a segment of the bush. ""The spray from the Falls,"" he informed me. ""We're almost there."" I still felt wrapped in a peculiar sense of elation following my troubled night. There was a deep-seated belief within me that I had arrived home. Home! Yet, I had never been here before, or had I in my dreams? We disembarked from the train and proceeded to the hotel, a large white structure protected against mosquitoes by wire mesh. There were no roads, no buildings. Stepping onto the porch, I let out a gasp. In the distance, facing us, were the Falls. I had never witnessed anything so majestic and beautiful, and I never would. ""Anne, you're in a trance,"" Suzanne remarked as we sat down for lunch. ""I've never seen you like this."" She eyed me with curiosity. ""Am I?"" I chuckled, but my laughter felt strained. ""It's just that I adore it all."" ""It's more than that."" A hint of concern creased her brow. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that, I had the peculiar sensation that I was anticipating something, something that would occur soon. I was agitated, restless. After tea, we took a leisurely stroll, hopped on the trolley, and were pushed by grinning locals along the miniature rail tracks to the bridge. The sight was marvelous, with the immense chasm and rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that occasionally parted to reveal the cascade of water before closing up once more in its impenetrable mystery. That, to me, was the allure of the Falls—their elusive nature. You always believe you're on the cusp of seeing them, yet you never do. Crossing the bridge, we meandered along the path marked by white stones on either side, circling the edge of the gorge. Eventually, we reached a vast clearing where a path on the left descended towards the chasm. ""The palm gully,"" Colonel Race explained. ""Shall we venture down? Or save it for tomorrow? It's quite a trek, and the climb back up is challenging."" ""We'll save it for tomorrow,"" Sir Eustace decided. He did not seem keen on strenuous physical activity, I observed. Leading the way back, we passed a sturdy native man. Trailing behind him was a woman laden with what appeared to be their entire household belongings balanced on her head! The assortment included a frying pan! ""I never have my camera when I need it,"" lamented Suzanne. ""Such opportunities arise frequently enough, Mrs. Blair,"" Colonel Race remarked. ""So cease lamenting."" We returned to the bridge. ""Shall we explore the rainbow forest?"" he proposed. ""Or are you wary of getting wet?"" Suzanne and I joined him. Sir Eustace headed back to the hotel. I found the rainbow forest somewhat disappointing. There were not nearly enough rainbows, and we ended up drenched, but every now and then, we caught a glimpse of the Falls across the way, reminding us of their vast expanse.",1
"Lady Willard was deeply concerned about her son's safety after her husband's death, believing that an occult influence may be at play. Poirot, surprisingly superstitious, promised to protect her son. Lady Willard revealed details about the members of the expedition, including the American secretary, Harper. Poirot cabled New York for information on young Mr. Bleibner, who had a troubled past and had recently been in Egypt. Poirot considered the possibility of a more modern crime, involving poison and remorse. He decided to travel to Egypt to investigate further, much to the dismay of his travel-worn companion, Hastings.",1
"What was the reason she stayed there? Was it in the hopes of encountering Jack Renauld? I had informed her (believing it at the time) that he was traveling to Buenos Ayres by sea. Perhaps she knew that the Anzora had not departed. But in order to be aware of that, she must have seen Jack. Was this what Poirot was investigating? Had Jack Renauld, coming back to meet Marthe Daubreuil, unexpectedly run into Bella Duveen, the woman he had callously abandoned? It was starting to make sense. If that was the situation, it could provide Jack with the alibi he was searching for. However, his silence in that case appeared to be quite puzzling.",1
"“I enjoy sending telegrams. And they irritate Clarence so much. He always insists that a letter would suffice. I doubt he would reveal anything, though. He is incredibly discreet. That’s what makes him so challenging to live with for extended periods. But let’s continue with our matchmaking. I’m certain Colonel Race is quite taken with you, Anne. Just give him a few sly looks from those mischievous eyes of yours, and it’s a done deal. Everyone gets engaged on a ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I have no desire to get married.” “Really?” Suzanne responded. “Why not? I find marriage quite enjoyable, even with Clarence!” I found her casual attitude distasteful. “What I want to know is,” I stated firmly, “what is Colonel Race’s involvement in all this? He must be connected somehow.” “Do you think it was pure coincidence that he shared that story?” “No, I don’t,” I declared. “He was observing all of us closely. Remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, but not all. Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I avoided a direct answer. “I am curious,” I remarked, “about the fate of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We are beginning to shed some light on the situation, at least. It seems the diamonds are what everyone is after. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ must have killed Nadina to obtain the diamonds.” “He did not kill her,” I interjected sharply. “He most certainly did. Who else could have done it?” “I don’t know. But I am certain he did not kill her.” “He entered that house three minutes after her and emerged as pale as a ghost.” “Because he discovered her lifeless body.” “But no one else entered.” “Then the murderer was already inside the house, or found another way in. He didn’t necessarily need to pass the lodge, he could have scaled the wall.” Suzanne gave me a piercing look. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she pondered. “Who could he be, I wonder? Regardless, he was the same person as the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He had enough time to remove his disguise and follow the woman to Marlow. She and Carton were supposed to meet there, both had an appointment to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their encounter seem coincidental, they must have suspected they were being followed. Nonetheless, Carton was unaware that his pursuer was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost control and stepped back onto the tracks. It all seems quite clear, wouldn’t you agree, Anne?” I remained silent. “Yes, that’s how it happened. He took the document from the deceased man, and in his haste to escape he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow. What did he do after leaving there, after he had either killed her or, as you claim, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still, I said nothing. “I wonder,” Suzanne pondered. “Could he have persuaded Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would have been a perfect opportunity to safely leave England and evade capture.”",1
"I meekly agreed to his request for company, though apprehensive of the consequences. Before his departure, I inquired about his name, to which he casually replied, ""Harry Rayburn."" The sudden onset of seasickness during the journey left me incapacitated and indifferent to my original mission. However, a kind gesture from Mrs. Flemming led to a change in plans, as I decided to embark on a new adventure in South Africa. With a generous parting gift in hand, I set out on my journey, eventually finding some solace on deck and observing the intriguing passengers around me. The arrival in Madeira brought a glimmer of hope, as the scent of violets lifted my spirits and made me consider enduring the remainder of the voyage.",1
"I never fooled myself into thinking that it held any significance. It was likely just a passing fancy. Nevertheless, I had the ability to intrigue her. She was a woman who had encountered the typical thrills of life. I intended to introduce her to an exceptional one! I admired her; admired her relaxed demeanor, her absence of emotional exaggeration, her sincerity. I was determined. I resolved to find her at that moment. She probably hadn't retired for the night. But then I realized that I was unaware of her cabin number.",1
"After committing the crime, the killer had to disguise himself to avoid detection. He had to wear a false beard and wig, and sleep separately from his wife to avoid suspicion. The gardener's sighting of the killer sneaking around the house was indeed true. The killer disposed of his clothes in the lake and pawned the stolen ring to divert attention. The unexpected phone call about a murder at Count Foscatini's flat led to a chilling discovery - the victim was found dead at his writing table, struck by a brutal blow to the head.",1
"I planned everything meticulously, sending him to Florence while informing the hotel that I was heading to Nice for a night or maybe two. When the murder was uncovered, I had already returned to Cannes, without anyone suspecting I had even left the Riviera. His demeanor remained casual and genuine, making it hard to believe he was the notorious criminal known as the ""Colonel."" As I processed everything in my head, it all started to fall into place.",1
"She let out a muffled scream, and I couldn't help but gasp in shock. Standing before me was none other than Cinderella, my friend from the train! The feeling of astonishment was mutual. ""You,"" we both said at the same time. It was Cinderella who composed herself first. ""My dear Aunt!"" she cried. ""What brings you here?"" ""And what about you?"" I shot back. ""Just the other day, you were on your way back to England like a dutiful child. Did they give you a permanent pass to travel back and forth, thanks to your connections in Parliament?"" I paid no mind to the rest of her words.",1
"I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",1
"He stood up to greet me when I entered the room, taking both of my hands in his and patting them gently. ""My dear child,"" he whispered. ""My dear, dear child."" Despite myself, I couldn't help but feel like a vulnerable orphan in his presence. His demeanor was soothing and paternal, yet there was an underlying hint of condescension. It was clear that he saw me as a naive young woman facing a harsh world alone. I quickly realized that there was no point in trying to prove him wrong. And in the end, maybe it was for the best that I didn't.",1
"Instead, she met my gaze with a chuckle and remarked, “You know, Anne, you're quite the unconventional girl. Don't you ever have doubts?” “Doubts?” I inquired, confused. “Yes, doubts, doubts, doubts! Venturing off on your own with hardly any money. What will you do when you're stranded in a foreign land with no funds?” “Why worry about that now? I still have plenty of money. The twenty-five pounds from Mrs. Flemming is untouched, and I won the sweepstakes yesterday, adding another fifteen pounds. I have a good amount of money. Forty pounds!” “Forty pounds!” Mrs. Blair muttered to herself. “I couldn't do what you're doing, Anne, and I consider myself brave in my own way. I couldn't set off happily with a few pounds in my pocket, unsure of my destination and purpose.” “But that's the thrill of it,” I exclaimed, feeling a surge of excitement. “It's all about the adventure.” She nodded thoughtfully. “Lucky Anne! Not many people share your perspective.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what's your take on all this, Mrs. Blair?” “I find it incredibly thrilling! Let's focus on the facts. You mentioned that in Sir Eustace's secretary, not the dour Pagett, the other one, you recognized the man who was stabbed and sought refuge in your cabin?” I nodded. “That connects Sir Eustace to the mystery in two ways. The woman was murdered in his house, and his secretary was stabbed at one o'clock. I don't suspect Sir Eustace, but there must be a link somewhere, even if he's unaware of it.”“And then there's the stewardess,” she pondered. “What did she look like?” “I didn't pay much attention to her. But I did find her face somewhat familiar, probably because I'd seen her around the ship.” “Her face struck a chord with you,” Suzanne remarked. “Are you sure she wasn't a man?” “She was tall,” I admitted. “It's unlikely to be Sir Eustace or Mr. Pagett. Wait!” Suzanne grabbed a scrap of paper and began sketching eagerly. “A striking resemblance to the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now, for the rest.” She handed me the paper. “Is this your stewardess?” “Yes, that's her!” I exclaimed. “Suzanne, you're brilliant!” She waved off the praise. “I've always had my doubts about this Chichester. Remember how he reacted to the Crippen discussion the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits together so far. But what's the significance of it all? What was supposed to happen at one o'clock in Cabin 17? It couldn't be the secretary's stabbing. There must be a deeper meaning. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with Nadina in that cabin. But why didn't she make the voyage?” A realization struck me. “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind raced back to the vacant room in the deserted house, and the memory of the film roll. A more recent memory of films surfaced. Why did I associate this with Mrs. Blair? The mystery deepened as we uncovered a tin cylinder filled with diamonds. Suzanne's excitement was palpable as we delved into the implications.",1
"Speeding away from London in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, Havering explained the situation to Captain Hastings. Hunter’s Lodge, where the tragedy occurred, was a small shooting-box in the Derbyshire moors. Havering's real home was near Newmarket, renting a flat in town during the season. The lodge was managed by a housekeeper, with servants brought down during the shooting season. Havering's uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace, had lived with them for three years. The uncle had suggested a trip to Derbyshire, but was found murdered the night before. Japp from Scotland Yard was on the case, meeting Havering and Hastings at the small grey stone building on the moors. Japp had questions for Havering before heading back to the village.",1
"… I barely had time to entertain the chilling thought that had crossed my mind before Jack Renauld entered the room. Poirot greeted him with a professional demeanor. ""Please, have a seat, sir. I apologize for the inconvenience, but you must understand that I find the atmosphere of the Villa quite unpleasant. M. Giraud and I have differing opinions on several matters. His lack of courtesy towards me has not gone unnoticed, and I have no intention of sharing any findings with him."" ""Of course, M. Poirot,"" replied the young man.",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had captivated Paris, graciously acknowledged the applause, her black eyes gleaming and scarlet lips curling upwards. The Manager, a bearded gentleman, embraced her warmly, praising her exceptional performance. Bouquets and futuristic garments filled her dressing room, the air heavy with the scent of blossoms and perfumes. When Count Sergius Paulovitch arrived, Nadina's demeanor shifted subtly. They conversed in English, revealing a shared heritage. Despite her success, Nadina expressed unease about lingering suspicions from the War.",1
"The Grand Duke of Russia, court intrigues, and political plots all pointed back to the mysterious woman herself! She was the mastermind behind the clever deceptions, manipulating others to part with their money under false pretenses of possessing the legendary ""Crown jewels,"" which turned out to be nothing more than worthless imitations. Her entire life story was exposed without mercy. The reason behind the murder was connected to a man named Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Despite his efforts to evade the truth, Mr. Trapp eventually confessed that he harbored feelings for the woman and would have proposed marriage if she were available.",1
"""Poirot!” exclaimed I, “what more can you tell me?” “My friend, it is up to you to draw your own conclusions. The facts are at your disposal! Focus your mind. Think not as Giraud does, but as Hercule Poirot.” “But are you certain?” “In many ways, I have been foolish. But now, clarity has come to me.” “Do you know everything?” “I have uncovered what M. Renauld wanted me to uncover.” “And you have identified the killer?” “I know one of the killers.” “What do you mean?” “We are speaking at cross-purposes. There are not one but two crimes here. I have solved the first, but as for the second, well, I must admit, I am uncertain!” “But, Poirot, didn't you say the man in the shed died of natural causes?” “Tsk tsk tsk.” Poirot let out a sound of impatience. “You still do not grasp. One can have a crime without a perpetrator, but for two crimes, one must have two bodies.” His statement struck me as oddly unclear, and I gazed at him with concern. However, he seemed perfectly composed. Suddenly, he got up and walked over to the window. “He's here,” he remarked. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent him a message asking him to come here.” This shifted the direction of my thoughts, and I questioned Poirot about Jack Renauld's presence in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my clever friend off guard, but as usual, he was all-knowing. He, too, had made inquiries at the station. “And most likely, we are not the only ones with this idea, Hastings. The admirable Giraud has surely done the same.” “You don't suppose,” I began, then hesitated. “Ah, no, it's too dreadful!” Poirot looked at me questioningly, but I said nothing more. I had just realized that among the seven women linked to the case - Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants - there was only one man, Jack Renauld, aside from the elderly Auguste who was hardly capable. And a man must have dug a grave. I didn't have time to explore further the horrifying thought that had crossed my mind, as Jack Renauld entered the room. Poirot greeted him in a professional manner. “Please, have a seat, sir. I apologize for disturbing you, but you may understand that the atmosphere at the Villa is not to my liking. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye on everything. His treatment of me has not been pleasant, and you will understand that I do not wish for any discoveries I make to benefit him in any way.” “Of course, M. Poirot,” replied the young man. “That Giraud character is a disagreeable fellow, and I would be happy to see someone get the better of him.” “Then may I ask a small favor of you?” “Certainly.” “I would like you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac.”",1
"“Listen here, that one is not meant for you! Trust me,” warned Papa Poirot. “But why,” I exclaimed, “the commissary assured me she was not only beautiful, but also virtuous! An absolute angel!”Poirot chuckled, “Some of the most notorious criminals I've encountered had the charm of angels. A deviation in the brain's cells can easily mask itself behind the face of innocence.”Shocked, I protested, “Poirot, you can't possibly think that a young, innocent girl like her could be involved in this!”“Now, now, calm down! I never said I suspected her of anything,"" Poirot replied calmly.",1
"""Sentiment means everything to a woman, does it not? But a man like you, who lacks such delicate sensibilities, may find some small comfort in that fact."" ""Of course, of course,"" Mr. Opalsen replied, somewhat uncertainly. ""Still..."" His words were cut off by a triumphant shout from the inspector. He entered the room, holding something between his fingers. Mrs. Opalsen sprang up from her seat with a cry. She looked like a different person. ""Oh, my necklace!"" she exclaimed, holding it tightly to her chest. We all gathered around her. ""Where was it?"" Opalsen demanded. ""In the maid's bed.""",1
"""We never considered that possibility."" ""Like I mentioned,"" M. Hautet continued, ""initially the case appeared straightforward, but the presence of the masked intruders and the mysterious letter from M. Renauld have added layers of complexity. It seems we are now dealing with a completely separate set of circumstances, seemingly unrelated. In regards to the letter addressed to you, is it plausible that it had any connection to this 'Bella' and her menacing intentions?"" Poirot dismissed the idea with a shake of his head. ""Highly unlikely. A man of M. Renauld's caliber, someone who has experienced life's dangers in far-flung corners of the world, would not seek protection from a woman."" The examining magistrate vigorously nodded in agreement.",1
"""But imagine if you had actually married that little doctor of yours. It's a good thing you didn't - he doesn't seem like the type who would appreciate having explosives lying around the house! Are you planning to inform Lord Nasby about this?"" I shook my head. ""Yet you still think he's innocent?"" ""I've seen innocent people get punished before."" ""Well, Anne, you need to accept the possibility. Despite your beliefs, he could very well be the one who committed this murder."" ""No,"" I stated firmly. ""He's not the one."" ""You're letting your emotions cloud your judgment."" ""No, I'm not. He may have had a reason to harm her, but he didn't.""",1
"But there was no assurance in reality that Anna the Adventuress wouldn't meet a sudden end at the conclusion of any Episode. I found myself in a difficult situation. The words Rayburn had spoken that morning echoed in my mind. ""Tell the truth,"" he had urged. But would it make any difference? Would anyone believe my account? How could they possibly accept that I embarked on this crazy journey based solely on a musty scrap of paper? It all sounded like a far-fetched story to me.",1
"""The insurance policy, that's what this is about, correct? But why must I deal with this now?"" ""Stay strong, Madame. Stay strong! Your husband had a substantial life insurance policy, so the Company needs to verify some information. They've given me the authority to represent them. I promise to make this process as painless as possible for you. Can you please tell me what happened on Wednesday?"" ""I was getting ready for tea when my maid informed me that one of the gardeners had urgently come to the house.""",1
"On the pretense of fetching her employer, she rushes upstairs, dons a colorful sweater and a cap adorned with black ringlets which she forcefully pulls over the gray wig. A couple of skillful adjustments, and the makeup is erased, a hint of blush applied, and the captivating Zoe Havering descends with her melodious voice. No one pays much attention to the maid. Why would they? There is no evidence linking her to the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the gun discovered in Ealing? Mrs. Havering couldn't have left it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s doing but they made a blunder.",1
"""His plan, from what I gathered, involved assigning her enough tasks to keep her glued to her desk in her designated area all day long."" I chuckled. Later, along with the other two, I located Sir Eustace. He paced back and forth in the confined area, bombarding the hapless secretary, who I noticed for the first time. A tall, angular woman in plain attire, sporting spectacles and a businesslike demeanor. It seemed she struggled to keep up with Sir Eustace, as her pencil raced across the paper, her brow furrowed in concentration. I entered the compartment. ""Welcome aboard, sir,"" I quipped.",1
"""Despite the lack of clarity, rest assured that it holds importance."" ""At this moment,"" I pondered, ""even with more information, we are no closer to uncovering the truth behind Mr. Renauld's murder."" ""Correct,"" Poirot said cheerfully. ""In reality, we are much further away."" His strange contentment made me stare at him in disbelief. He caught my gaze and grinned. ""Indeed, it is for the best. Previously, there was a solid theory on the circumstances of his death. Now, that has vanished.""",1
"""Captain Hastings, we decided to visit Stosser and Paul, despite their reputation for expensive Mayfair flats. They offered us properties for four or five hundred a year, or with huge premiums. At the last minute, they mentioned an eighty-pound flat, but warned us that it had been on the market for some time and might already be taken. The clerk complained about people not confirming if they were interested, leading to wasted viewings. It was a frustrating situation for all involved.""",1
"The Kafir boy opened the door, gesturing for me to come in. Hesitating, I lingered in the dimly lit hall. Without a word, the man led me to another room. ""The young lady here to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,"" he announced with a chuckle. I entered. The room was bare, the air thick with the smell of stale tobacco. A man sat at a desk, scribbling away. He glanced up, surprised. ""Well, well, if it isn't Miss Beddingfeld,"" he remarked. ""I must be mistaken,"" I stammered. ""Are you Mr. Chichester, or perhaps Miss Pettigrew? You bear a striking resemblance to them both.""",1
"What an incredible chance for a skilled thief! Look over there, Hastings, that large woman standing next to the pillar. She is absolutely covered in jewels."" I followed his gaze. ""Oh my, that's Mrs. Opalsen."" ""You know her?"" ""A little. Her husband is a wealthy stockbroker who struck it rich in the recent Oil boom."" Later that evening we bumped into the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We exchanged pleasantries for a short while, and eventually enjoyed coffee together. Poirot complimented some of the more expensive gems adorning the lady's chest, and she immediately perked up. ""Collecting gems is a passion of mine, Mr.…""",1
"“No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” Poirot calmly pointed out. The inspector was taken aback by his confidence. Poirot then demonstrated his deductions swiftly, proving that the chambermaid couldn't have hidden the necklace. The inspector, satisfied, continued his search and found the necklace hidden in the maid's bed. Mrs. Opalsen was relieved to have it back, even though Poirot suspected it was an imitation. He decided to keep this information to himself, knowing that the true thief had not been caught. Poirot and his companion left the room, but Poirot's mind was already working on the next steps to solve the case.",1
"As we drove around in the afternoon, a flat tire caused a delay. By the time I returned to the Grand Metropolitan, it was already past 8 o'clock. The first thing I saw was Poirot, looking even smaller than usual, standing between the Opalsens with a look of contentment. ""My dear Hastings!"" he exclaimed, rushing over to greet me. ""Give me a hug, my friend; everything has gone perfectly!"" Fortunately, the hug was only a gesture, something one can never be certain of with Poirot. ""Are you saying"" I started. ""Absolutely marvelous, I must say!"" Mrs. Opalsen chimed in, her chubby face beaming. ""I told you, Ed, that if anyone could recover my pearls, it would be him."" ""You certainly did, my love, you certainly did.""",1
"""I'll be there in a minute, my friend. Just about done. Gotta get rid of this pesky grease spot!"" He gestured with his sponge. I smirked, lighting another cigarette. ""Watching anything interesting?"" I asked a few moments later. ""Helping a 'charlady' track down her missing husband. Tricky situation, requires finesse. I suspect he won't be too happy when we find him. Can't blame him, really. Takes a discerning man to get lost like that."" I chuckled.",1
"""I urge you not to part with it, George,"" she pleaded, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It holds generations of sentimental value."" She paused, anticipating a response, but met only silence which caused her expression to turn steely. With a nonchalant shrug, she remarked, ""I ought to go prepare myself. I suppose it's time to showcase 'the merchandise.'"" Casting a wry glance at Poirot, she added, ""It truly is one of the most atrocious necklaces to ever exist! George always talks of resetting the stones for me, yet it remains a mere promise."" And with that, she exited the room. Thirty minutes later, the trio convened in the grand drawing-room, awaiting her presence.",1
"""I wanted to ask how you knew about those two?"" ""My friend, I understand human nature. When you combine a young boy like Renauld with a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, the outcome is almost certain. And then, the argument! It was either money or a woman, and recalling Léonie's account of the boy's rage, I deduced the latter. So I took a chance and I was correct."" ""So that's why you cautioned me against falling for the lady? You already suspected that she had feelings for young Renauld?"" Poirot grinned. ""At least I noticed that she had worried eyes.""",1
"“Let’s play a little game,” Poirot suggested, fixing Black with a curious stare. “I will say a word, and you respond with the first word that comes to mind. Shall we start?” Black hesitated, but eventually agreed to participate. Poirot instructed Hastings to write down the words as they went along. With his watch set on the table, Poirot began. “Day.” Without much delay, Black replied, “Night.” The game continued with Poirot saying, “Name,” and Black responding with “Place.” As the words flowed, Poirot’s deductions sharpened. “Thank you, Captain Black. Can we speak in thirty minutes?” Black agreed, leaving Poirot to decipher the hidden meanings behind the words.",1
"""Now, based solely on the information we have discussed, I estimate the time of death to be the morning of June 7th."" His words left me in shock. ""How could you possibly be certain?"" I questioned. ""The only way to make sense of the sequence of events is by this conclusion. I have guided you through the facts, can you not see the truth now?"" ""I'm afraid I'm still lost,"" I admitted. Poirot's expression turned melancholic. ""It is truly unfortunate. Your intellect shows promise, yet lacks the necessary structure.""",1
"Poirot and I arrived at the Villa Geneviève to find a chaos of questions surrounding the murder of Mr. Renauld. The body was found in an open grave, a shocking discovery that raised more questions than answers. The servants, including the old housekeeper Françoise, were questioned about the events of the night, but it seemed that there was more to the story than met the eye. The mysterious lady who visited Mr. Renauld on the night of the murder added another layer of intrigue to the case. As we delved deeper into the investigation, it became clear that there were secrets hidden within the walls of the Villa Geneviève, waiting to be uncovered.",1
"Madame Beroldy was a mysterious woman who seemed to have ensnared the hearts of many, including the wealthy Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. However, tragedy struck when Madame Beroldy's husband was found murdered in their apartment. The investigation led to a trial where Madame Beroldy was accused of the crime. Despite the evidence against her, Madame Beroldy's eloquence and charm won the jury over, resulting in her acquittal. Georges Conneau, her lover, was suspected of the crime but never found. The case remained a mystery, with Madame Beroldy eventually leaving Paris with her child to start a new life. The details of the case were carefully examined, revealing the true nature of the characters involved.",1
"“Your Honor,” I began, feeling a weight of guilt on my shoulders, “I must confess to a serious misstep that I deeply regret.” “Please, go on,” the judge urged. “I encountered a young woman, a friend of mine, who expressed a strong curiosity to explore every corner of the crime scene. Against my better judgment, I gave her access to the restricted area,” I admitted. The magistrate's expression hardened. “This is a grave error, Detective Reynolds. Your actions were reckless and completely out of line. Such behavior cannot be tolerated in our line of work.”",1
"Célestine vehemently denied the accusations, claiming she never saw the pearls. The inspector, however, remained suspicious and decided to search her. Despite finding nothing, Poirot proposed a little experiment. Célestine reluctantly agreed and repeated her actions of fetching a reel of cotton and scissors from her room. Poirot observed closely, making notes in his pocket-book. After the experiment, Célestine was cleared of suspicion, leaving the inspector to search the room thoroughly to find the missing pearls.",1
"Softly unbolted the door, he peeked the cat’s head around the edge and let out a loud “Miaow.” The Scotland Yard inspector, along with another man, startled at the noise. “Ah, it’s just Monsieur Poirot and his antics!” the inspector exclaimed. “Let us in, sir.” “You have our friends?” “Yes, we have them. But they didn’t have the goods.” “I see. So you’ve come to search. Well, I’m about to leave with Hastings, but first, let me enlighten you on the history and behavior of the domestic cat.” “For heaven’s sake, have you lost your mind?” “The cat,” Poirot began, “was worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. It is still seen as a sign of good luck if a black cat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path tonight, Japp. To speak of the inside of any animal or person is not considered polite in England. But the inner lining of this cat is quite exquisite.” With a sudden move, the second man grabbed the cat from Poirot’s hand. “Oh, I forgot to introduce you,” said Japp. “Mr. Poirot, this is Mr. Burt of the United States Secret Service.” The American found what he was searching for. “Nice to meet you,” said Mr. Burt. “Perhaps this time, I won't die,” murmured Poirot, expressing his optimism. From a recovering influenza patient, this comment was a sign of hope. Poirot sat up in bed, sipping a noxious tisane and eyeing his medicine bottles. “Yes, yes,” Poirot continued. “Once more, I shall be the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of criminals! I even have a mention in Society Gossip. ‘Go ahead criminals! Hercule Poirot can't get a grip on you. Why? Because he’s got the flu!’” I laughed. “You're becoming quite popular, Poirot. And luckily, you haven’t missed anything during this time.” The landlady interrupted, announcing a visitor downstairs. “Mr. Roger Havering,” I read. Poirot motioned towards the bookcase, where I found “Who’s Who.” After scanning the pages, Poirot briefed me on Roger Havering’s background. I went downstairs to meet him. Roger Havering was anxious, urging Poirot to come to Derbyshire immediately. “I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is sick with the flu.” Havering was dismayed. “My uncle, my closest friend, was murdered last night,” he revealed. “In Derbyshire. I need Poirot to take on the case.” An idea struck me, and I informed Poirot. “I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not? You should know my methods by now. Just keep me updated daily.” An hour later, I was on a train with Mr. Havering, heading to Derbyshire. “We usually rent a flat in town for the season. Hunter’s Lodge, where the tragedy occurred, is a small shooting-box in the Derbyshire moors. My uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace, made his home with us. He was not hard to get along with, despite being exacting. Two days ago, he suggested we visit Derbyshire for a few days. My wife and I went down that same afternoon.”",1
"""They were missing when I returned from dinner."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Absolutely. I debated whether or not to wear them, but ultimately chose the emeralds and returned them to the jewel case."" ""Who had the key to the jewel case?"" ""I did. I always keep the key on a chain around my neck."" She displayed it as she spoke. The detective inspected it and raised an eyebrow. ""The thief likely had a copy of the key. Not a difficult task. The lock is rather basic. What was your next move after locking the jewel case?"" ""I placed it back in the usual bottom drawer."" ""You didn't lock the drawer?"" ""No, I never do.""",1
"He made his way to the boathouse, changed into his disguise that had been cleverly stashed away, disposed of his original clothes in the water, and proceeded with his scheme by selling the ring in a conspicuous manner, then instigating a scuffle with a police officer, ensuring his retreat to the sanctuary of Bow Street, a place no one would think to search for him! ""It's inconceivable,"" Japp muttered. ""Just ask Madame,"" my companion replied with a grin. The following morning, a certified letter awaited Poirot at his spot at the table. Upon opening it, a five-pound note slipped out. A look of concern creased my companion's forehead.",1
"I picked it up. It smelled of moth balls. So did the corpse. The doctor didn’t. So I deduced that the doctor must have removed it from the body. It had two words and some numbers written on it. ""Let’s see it,"" Lord Nasby reached out a careless hand. ""I think not,"" I replied, smiling. ""It’s my discovery, you see."" ""You're smart. Right to hold onto it. No qualms about not giving it to the police?"" ""I tried this morning. They didn't think it was connected to the Marlow case, so I decided to keep it. And the inspector annoyed me."" ""Short-sighted man. Keep working on your lead. If you find something publishable, send it my way. You have potential. But you have to prove yourself first. Understand?"" I thanked him and apologized for my tactics. ""Don’t worry. Cheek from a pretty girl is refreshing. By the way, you said two minutes and it’s been three, accounting for interruptions. Quite impressive for a woman! Must be your scientific background."" Back on the street, I found Lord Nasby tiresome. But I was thrilled. My plan had worked better than expected. Lord Nasby was surprisingly friendly. Now, I had to ""make good,"" as he put it. In my room, I examined the paper closely. What did the numbers mean? ""Seventeen one hundred and twenty-two,"" I whispered. No connection. I added them up. ""One and seven is eight, one is nine, two is eleven, two is thirteen."" Thirteen! Ominous number! Was it a warning to stay away? Possibly. But other than a warning, it seemed useless. The figures were not a clear indication of thirteen. So I subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. Resulting in a hundred and fifty-nine. I tried again and got a hundred and forty-nine. These calculations were futile in solving the mystery. I focused on the words. Kilmorden Castle. Concrete information. A place. Maybe the birthplace of an aristocratic family. Or a picturesque ruin. I leaned towards the buried treasure theory. Numbers often accompany treasure. Right, left, dig. I could figure that out later. The priority was reaching Kilmorden Castle quickly. I gathered reference books and searched. Time passed, annoyance grew. But there was no mention of Kilmorden Castle. A setback. There had to be such a place. Why invent a name and write it down? Absurd! Maybe it was a grandiose suburban home with a fabricated name. But it seemed impossible to find. I pondered how to proceed. The best option was visiting the crime scene. Sleuths always do. And they always discover what the police missed. I had to go to Marlow. But how to get inside the house? I considered various options and settled on simplicity. The house was vacant, I would pose as a potential tenant. I contacted local agents, hoping for fewer options. But I was wrong. The clerk presented a few properties. It was a challenge to find faults. It seemed like a dead end. ""Do you have anything else?"" I asked, desperately. ""There's the Mill House,"" the clerk mentioned. ""Where the murder happened."" ""I wouldn’t mind,"" I replied confidently. ""And maybe I could get a good deal given the circumstances."" A clever move, I believed. ""It’s a possibility. Not easy to rent now with servants and all. If you like it, make an offer. Shall I write you an order?"" ""Please do.""",1
"""I was."" As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. ""You didn't help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?"" I replied coldly, ""M. Poirot has gone to Paris. And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police."" Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. ""They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better.""",1
"He casually signed the receipt, mentioning offhandedly: ""This pen feels different, but I injured my hand in a rush."" The employee just grinned and noted little change. Rolf chuckled and added: ""Just don't mistake me for a criminal this time. Been receiving ominous notes from a Chinese man, and the problem is, I bear a resemblance to one myself, especially in the eyes."" ""I observed him,"" the clerk recounted, ""and immediately understood his point. The eyes angled upwards like those of an Asian. It had never caught my attention previously.""",1
"""Ah, that must be Japp and his crew pulling up."" A loud thud echoed on the door. ""How could you have found this location?"" I inquired as I trailed Poirot into the hallway. ""Ah, yes, you tailed the first Mrs. Robinson after she departed the other apartment."" ""Well done, Hastings. Your brain cells are finally in action. Now, time for a surprise for Japp."" Quietly unlocking the door, he peeked the cat's head around the corner and let out a sharp ""Meow."" The inspector from Scotland Yard, accompanied by another man, flinched involuntarily. ""Ah, it's just Monsieur Poirot up to his usual tricks!"" he exclaimed, while Poirot's head emerged next to the cat's.",1
"""Are you certain about the date of the crime?"" questioned the magistrate. ""Yes, it was the morning of June 8th when we received the news,"" replied the railway official. A second official was summoned to corroborate the testimony. Jack Renauld was then pointed out by the officials. ""These men have positively identified you. What do you have to say for yourself?"" asked the magistrate. Jack simply shrugged in response. M. Hautet shared a knowing look with the greffier before noting down the answer. ""Renauld, does this item look familiar to you?"" The magistrate picked up an object from the table and presented it to the prisoner.",1
"As I strained to hear young Renauld's response, my attention was suddenly captured by an unexpected sight a short distance away from the hedge. There was what appeared to be a brown bush, a peculiar sight indeed for this time of year. Intrigued, I approached for a closer look, only to have the brown bush swiftly retreat and signal for me to remain silent. It was Giraud. Gesturing for caution, he guided me around the shed until we were safely out of earshot. ""What were you up to over there?"" I inquired. ""The same thing you were doing - eavesdropping,"" Giraud replied. ""But I stumbled upon it accidentally!"" ""Ah,"" was all Giraud said in response.",1
"""Here you go! Please deliver this card to the commissary right away,"" she said, handing the man the message. He took it and, beckoning to his colleague, whistled. Within moments, another man arrived and received the card from her. After a brief wait, a stout man with a large moustache hurried over to the gate. The officer saluted and stepped aside. ""Ah, my dear detective,"" exclaimed the newcomer, ""I'm so glad you're here. Your timing couldn't be better."" The detective's face lit up. ""Mr. Smith! What a pleasant surprise."" He then glanced in my direction.",1
"""Ugh, this blasted sand!"" ""Oh come now, Belgium has plenty of sand,"" I pointed out, recalling a vacation in Knocke-sur-mer surrounded by ""les dunes impeccables"" as the guidebook described. ""Not in Brussels,"" Poirot stated firmly. He stared at the Pyramids pensively. ""It's true that they, at least, have a solid and geometrical shape, but their uneven surface is rather displeasing. And those palm trees, I cannot stand them. They don't even plant them in straight rows!"" I interrupted his complaints, proposing that we head to the camp.",1
"Mr. MacAdam was completely unaware of these precautions. Being a fearless man himself, he would likely remove them without a second thought. However, the police had already made their own arrangements. Interestingly, the Premier's chauffeur, O'Murphy, was actually a member of the C.I.D.""""O'Murphy? That sounds like an Irish name, doesn't it?""""Yes, he's indeed Irish.""""Which part of Ireland is he from?""""County Clare, if I'm not mistaken.""""Well, carry on, my lord.""""The Premier departed for London in a closed car, accompanied by Captain Daniels. The second car followed behind, as per usual.""",1
"""Oh, every detail! The location of the incident, the murder weapon, the victim, any fingerprints or other intriguing evidence. I never imagined I would be so close to a murder investigation like this. Will this memory haunt me forever?"" I walked away, feeling disgusted. What had society come to, with women finding excitement in such gruesome events? The girl's morbid enthusiasm made me feel sick to my stomach. I had heard of the crowds of women gathering outside courtrooms during capital trials, but I never understood who these women were until now.",1
"I watched as horror overtook her expression, her once debonair demeanor now extinguished. She had ignored my advice, and now faced the consequences. I was uncharacteristically ruthless towards her. She needed to face the truth. Turning the body over gently, I pointed out, ""He was stabbed in the back."" Her response was barely audible. ""With what?"" I gestured towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Without warning, she staggered and collapsed. I rushed to her side. ""You're faint. Let's get you out of here. This has all been too much for you."" ""Water,"" she whispered.",1
"“The voice on the phone was desperate. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor, they’ve killed me!’ Then it faded, leaving me shaken. ‘Who is this?’ I asked. ‘Who is this?’ A faint whisper replied, ‘Foscatine, Regent’s Court.’” The doctor gasped. “Count Foscatini! He lives in Regent’s Court. I must hurry. What could have transpired?” Poirot inquired, “One of your patients?” The doctor nodded, “I treated him recently for a minor ailment. An Italian, fluent in English.”",1
"Poirot’s expression turned somber as he listened to the grave situation unfolding. The looming threat of the Prime Minister's kidnapping cast a shadow over the upcoming Conference, set to commence at nine o’clock the following night. The absence of the Prime Minister, the key figure with a strong personality, could lead to disastrous consequences, potentially derailing any hopes for a peaceful resolution. The Pacifist propaganda orchestrated by German agents added another layer of complexity to the already tense atmosphere. Time was running out, and there seemed to be no suitable replacement who could effectively represent England in such a crucial moment.",1
"Poirot glanced at me with a raised eyebrow. ""Here we go!"" he whispered. ""You've already spotted a goddess!"" ""But, come on, wasn't she?"" I pressed. ""Possibly. I didn't take notice,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""You must have seen her?"" I insisted. ""My friend, two people hardly ever perceive the same thing. You, for example, saw a goddess. I,"" he paused. ""Yes?"" ""I only saw a girl with worried eyes,"" Poirot stated seriously. Just then, we arrived at a large green gate, and both of us gasped in unison. Standing before it was an imposing police officer. He signaled us to stop. ""You can't go through, gentlemen.",1
"""Léonie informed me that the thieves had rifled through our belongings and taken the money, but it was clear that they did not find what they were looking for. I overheard the tall man ordering my husband to get dressed, followed by some noise in the house that seemed to startle them. They hurried him into my room, only half dressed,"" Eloise recounted.Poirot interrupted, ""Is there no other way out of the dressing-room?""""No, there is only the door that leads to my room. The short man led my husband through, with the tall man following closely behind, still holding the dagger. My husband tried to reach me, his eyes filled with agony. 'I need to speak with her,' he pleaded. Standing by the bed, he reassured me, 'Don't worry, Eloise. Everything will be fine. I'll be back before morning.' Despite his attempt to sound confident, I could see the fear in his eyes. They then took him away, warning him that any noise would result in his death,"" Eloise continued.""After that, I must have passed out. The next thing I remember is Léonie trying to revive me with some brandy,"" she added.The magistrate turned to Eloise, ""Did you have any idea what the assailants were searching for?""""No, none at all,"" she replied.""Did you notice any change in your husband's behavior recently?"" the magistrate inquired.""Yes, about ten days ago,"" Eloise recalled. ""Did you ask him about it?""""I did, but he avoided the topic. I could tell he was hiding something from me,"" she admitted.""Did you know that he had hired a detective, M. Hercule Poirot?"" the magistrate asked.Surprised, Eloise responded, ""No, I had no idea.""Poirot then handed her the letter from her husband, explaining, ""He called for my services today.""As the interrogation continued, the magistrate asked, ""Can you recall what time this incident occurred?""Eloise answered, ""I heard the clock strike two.""Pointing to a broken wristwatch, the magistrate observed, ""This watch indicates seven o'clock. It seems the assassins did not realize it was still ticking.""Poirot, examining the watch, revealed, ""The glass is broken, but the watch is still functioning.""The magistrate, puzzled, asked, ""But it is not seven o'clock now?""""No, it's a little after five,"" Poirot clarified. Turning back to Eloise, the magistrate questioned, ""The front door was found unlocked. Any explanation?""""It's possible my husband forgot to latch it after going out for a walk,"" she suggested.The commissary interjected, ""The fact that the thieves made M. Renauld dress before taking him suggests that the location they were headed to, where 'the secret' was hidden, was quite some distance away.""The magistrate nodded in agreement, considering the possibility of a motor waiting for them.",1
"""The woman's early discovery of the theft disrupted her carefully laid plans. No doubt, the culprits are present. One of them must have concealed the stolen items, and it seems highly improbable that the chambermaid would be involved."" ""More than improbable, downright impossible!"" Poirot interjected calmly. The inspector looked puzzled. Poirot smiled modestly. ""Allow me to demonstrate. Hastings, my dear friend, please hold my watch carefully. It is a precious family heirloom! I meticulously timed Mademoiselle's movements - her first absence lasted twelve seconds, while her second lasted fifteen. Now, observe my movements. Madam, would you kindly provide me with the key to the jewel case.""",1
"""I think it's one of the most exquisite necklaces in the world, the pearls are perfectly matched and the color is flawless. I really need to go and fetch it!"" ""Oh, madame,"" objected Poirot, ""you are too kind. Please don't trouble yourself!"" ""But I want to share it with you."" The plump woman hurried over to the elevator. Her husband, who had been conversing with me, glanced at Poirot with curiosity. ""Your wife is so kind to want to show me her pearl necklace,"" Poirot clarified. ""Ah, the pearls!"" Opalsen grinned contentedly.",1
"“But, my goodness! What will happen to Bella?” “If I were in your shoes,” Poirot advised, “I wouldn't worry too much. The French legal system tends to be forgiving towards young and beautiful individuals involved in crimes of passion. A skilled attorney could argue for mitigating circumstances. It won't be easy for you” “I'm not concerned about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a sense I do feel responsible for my father's death. If not for me and my relationship with this woman, he would still be alive. And then my foolish mistake in taking the wrong coat.",1
"Had my obsession with the smell of moth balls gone too far? I thought I was imagining things when I detected the familiar scent on the roll of films as well. Holding them up to my nose only confirmed my suspicions. There was definitely a strong smell of moth balls lingering on them. But upon closer inspection, I discovered a tiny piece of cloth stuck on a rough edge of the film reel, saturated with the unpleasant odor. It became clear that the films had once been in the overcoat pocket of the man who met his end in the Tube. But how did they end up here? It couldn't have been him - his every move had been traced and documented.",1
"I was immediately suspicious and discovered that he was actually sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle. I transformed myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age to avoid detection. Following him to London, he met Anita Grünberg, whom I hated for ruining my life. She left the agent's office with an order for the Mill House in Marlow. I trailed them to Knightsbridge, where she went to the Hyde Park Hotel. I followed Carton into the Tube station and tried to confront him, leading to a fatal accident. Realizing the danger I was in, I attached myself to Sir Eustace Pedler as his secretary. The identity of the 'Colonel' remained a mystery, but the search for the truth continued.",1
"… The love she felt for him was undeniable! Could she bear the thought of being the one responsible for his demise? While she had been tangled in her fair share of wrongdoing, the heinous crime she was accused of was not one of them. Regardless, her charisma and charm carried the day. Madame Beroldy, in the midst of a frenzy of emotions, was pronounced not guilty. Despite the relentless efforts of law enforcement, Georges Conneau remained elusive. As for Madame Beroldy, she vanished without a trace. With the child in tow, she departed Paris to embark on a fresh chapter. The case of Beroldy has been meticulously documented. While not all the specifics were immediately recalled, the essence of the case was captured with precision. The case had captured widespread attention and had been extensively covered by the English press, making it easy for me to recollect the key elements. In that moment of excitement, everything seemed to fall into place. I must admit, I can be impulsive at times, much to Poirot’s dismay. Nevertheless, in this particular instance, I believe my haste was justified. The revelation perfectly aligned with Poirot’s perspective, a fact that did not escape my notice. “Poirot,” I exclaimed, “I now see it all clearly.” “If that is indeed the case, I commend you. Your ability to see things clearly is not one of your most prominent traits, is it not?” Poirot remarked, a hint of teasing in his tone. Slightly irritated, I retorted, “Don’t be so cryptic. Your subtle hints and seemingly insignificant details made it challenging to grasp your intentions.” Poirot meticulously lit one of his slender cigarettes before responding. “Now that you see everything, my dear friend, what is your conclusion?” “It was Madame Daubreuil Beroldy who committed the murder of Mr. Renauld. The striking resemblance between the two cases leaves no room for doubt.” “So, you believe that Madame Beroldy was wrongfully acquitted? That she was, in fact, complicit in her husband’s murder?” I widened my eyes in surprise. “Absolutely! Don’t you?” Poirot paced to the other end of the room, adjusted a chair absentmindedly, and then spoke thoughtfully. “Indeed, that is my belief. However, it is not as straightforward as you think, my friend. Legally speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.” “Perhaps of that particular crime. But not this one.” Poirot resumed his seat, his contemplative expression more pronounced. “So, you are convinced, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil was the one who killed Mr. Renauld?” “Yes.” “Why do you think so?” He posed the question abruptly, catching me off guard. “Why?” I faltered. “Why? Oh, because…” My words trailed off. Poirot nodded knowingly. “You see, you stumble upon a hurdle immediately. What could have been Madame Daubreuil’s motive for murdering Mr. Renauld? We find no trace of a reason. A murder without a motive is unheard of.",1
"""The cabin must have held some secrets,"" I suggested. ""That would make sense of why my belongings were thrown about the following day. Yet, I scoured every inch and found nothing hidden."" ""Do you think the young man could have planted something in a drawer while you were distracted?"" Suzanne proposed. I dismissed the idea. ""I would have noticed."" ""Perhaps they were after your important document?"" she pondered. ""It's possible, but it had already served its purpose. The time and date had come and gone."" Suzanne concurred, ""True, of course.""",1
"I’d much prefer to have emerald green eyes than dark blue ones with silver flecks! Still, blue is a good color for adventurers. I wrapped a navy garment loosely around me, exposing my arms and shoulders. Then I tied my hair back and gathered it in a bun over my ears again. I applied a moderate amount of powder to my face, so that the skin appeared slightly paler than usual. I rummaged until I found some ancient lip balm, and I applied plenty of it to my lips. Then I shaded under my eyes with charcoal. Lastly, I draped a blue scarf over my naked shoulder, placed a crimson flower in my hair, and held a cigar in one corner of my mouth. The overall look satisfied me greatly. “Emily the Explorer,” I murmured, gazing at my reflection. “Emily the Explorer. Episode I, ‘The Cottage in Chelsea’!” Women are foolish creatures. In the following weeks, I was quite bored. Mrs. Flemming and her acquaintances struck me as exceedingly dull. They chatted endlessly about themselves and their offspring, the challenges of finding good milk for their children, and the confrontations with the Dairy over subpar milk. Then they moved on to domestic staff, and the struggles of finding competent servants, along with the discussions with the woman at the Registry Office and the responses received. They seemed disinterested in current events and the world at large. They despised traveling, finding everything too dissimilar to England. The Riviera was acceptable, naturally, as it was a meeting place for all their friends. I listened with great effort to contain my impatience. Most of these women were wealthy. They had the opportunity to explore the vast and beautiful world, yet chose to remain in grimy, dull London, discussing milkmen and housekeepers! Reflecting back now, I realize I may have been a tad intolerant. But they were insipid, incompetent even in their chosen vocation: many of them maintained remarkably inadequate and chaotic household accounts. My situation did not progress rapidly. The residence and furnishings had been sold, and the proceeds barely covered our debts. Thus far, I had not secured employment. Not that I truly desired one! I firmly believed that if I sought adventure, it would find me. It is my belief that one always obtains what they seek. My belief was about to be confirmed. It was early in January, the 8th to be precise. I was returning from an unsuccessful meeting with a lady seeking a secretary-companion, who actually seemed to require a robust cleaning lady willing to work twelve hours a day for £25 per year. After parting ways with veiled discourtesies, I strolled down Edgware Road (the meeting was held in a residence in St. John’s Wood) and across Hyde Park to St. George’s Hospital. Entering Hyde Park Corner Tube Station, I purchased a ticket to Gloucester Road. Upon reaching the platform, I walked to the far end. Curiosity drove me to confirm the existence of points and an opening between the two tunnels just past the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly delighted to be proven correct. There were few individuals on the platform, and at the very end stood only myself and a man. As I passed by, I wrinkled my nose in disdain. The scent of mothballs was unbearable to me! This man's heavy coat reeked of them. Yet most individuals began wearing winter coats before January, so the scent should have dissipated by then. The man was ahead of me, standing near the tunnel edge. Lost in thought, he paid me no attention, allowing me to observe him closely. He was a petite, lean man with a tanned face, light blue eyes, and a small dark beard. “Just returned from abroad,” I surmised. “That explains the smell of his coat. He's arrived from India. Not a military officer, or he would not sport a beard. Perhaps a tea planter.” At that moment, the man pivoted as if to retreat along the platform. His gaze shifted from me to something behind me, and his expression altered drastically. Fear, almost panic, distorted his features. Stepping backward involuntarily, as if recoiling from an unseen threat, he lost his footing and tumbled over the edge. A bright flash emanated from the tracks, accompanied by a crackling noise. I screamed. Onlookers rushed to the scene. Two station officials materialized out of thin air and took charge. I remained rooted to the spot, held by a horrific fascination. Part of me recoiled at the abrupt tragedy, while another part observed with detached interest the efforts to rescue the man from the electrified rail and return him to the platform. “Please step aside. I am a physician.” A tall man with a brown beard pushed past me and bent over the motionless body. A peculiar sense of unreality enveloped me as he examined the man. It all felt surreal. Finally, the doctor straightened up and shook his head. “Deceased. There's nothing more to be done.” The crowd drew nearer, and an annoyed porter raised his voice. “Back up, will you? What’s the point of crowding around.” Nausea washed over me, and I turned and fled blindly, racing up the stairs towards the lift. It was too ghastly. I needed to escape into the open air. The doctor who had inspected the body was just ahead of me. The lift was on the verge of ascending, another had descended, and he broke into a run. In his haste, he dropped a piece of paper. I halted, picked it up, and rushed after him. However, the lift doors shut in my face, leaving me clutching the paper. By the time the lift reached street level, the doctor had vanished. I prayed the lost item was inconsequential, and for the first time, I examined it closely. It was a blank half-sheet of notepaper scrawled with some figures and words in pencil. The handwriting was illegible: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: "". 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] Initially, it seemed unimportant. Yet, I hesitated to discard it. Pinching my nose in annoyance at the scent of mothballs, I gingerly held the paper to my face. Detecting a strong odor, I carefully folded the paper and stowed it in my bag. I made my way home slowly, lost in thought. I informed Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a dreadful incident in the Tube and felt unsettled, retiring to my room to rest. The kind woman insisted on serving me tea. Once left to my own devices, I set my plan in motion. I aimed to unravel the peculiar sensation of unreality I experienced while observing the doctor examine the deceased. Initially, I lay on the floor mimicking the position of the corpse, then substituted a bolster, meticulously replicating every gesture and movement of the doctor to the best of my recollection. Upon completion, I sat back and frowned at the opposite wall. The evening papers contained a brief snippet about a fatality in the Tube, questioning whether it was suicide or accident. To me, it was clear what needed to be done, and Mr. Flemming concurred upon hearing my account. “Certainly, you will be required at the inquest. You claim no one else was in close proximity to witness what occurred?” “I sensed someone approaching from behind, but I cannot confirm, and in any case, they would not have been as near as I was.” The inquest convened. Mr. Flemming made the necessary arrangements and accompanied me. He seemed apprehensive about the ordeal I would face, unaware of my composed demeanor. The deceased was identified as L. B. Carton. His pockets contained solely a note from a house agent to view a property near Marlow on the river. The bureau clerk from the hotel confirmed the man's arrival the previous day, registering under the name L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He appeared to have disembarked directly from a steamer. I was the sole witness to the incident. “You believe it was accidental?” inquired the coroner. “I am certain of it. Something startled him, causing him to step backward without thought.” “But what could have caused this alarm?” “That remains a mystery. However, he was undeniably frightened. He appeared panicked.” A juryman suggested some men had an irrational fear of cats, proposing the deceased might have encountered one. I found his theory lacking brilliance, though it seemed to placate the jury eager to adjourn and inclined to declare the incident an accident rather than suicide. “I find it puzzling,” remarked the coroner, “that the initial examining doctor did not come forward. His details should have been recorded at the time. It was highly irregular not to do so.” I smiled inwardly. I harbored my own suspicions regarding the doctor. In line with my theory, I resolved to visit Scotland Yard promptly. However, the following morning brought an unexpected turn of events. The Flemmings subscribed to the Daily Budget, and the publication was reveling in its latest scoop. EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWING TUBE TRAGEDY. WOMAN DISCOVERED SLAIN IN ISOLATED DWELLING. I avidly perused the article. “A shocking revelation unfolded yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, owned by Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is available for rent unfurnished. An order to view this property was found in the possession of the man initially believed to have committed suicide by throwing himself onto the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. In an upper chamber of the Mill House, the lifeless body of a striking young woman was unearthed, strangled. She is presumed to be a foreigner, yet remains unidentified. Law enforcement allegedly possesses a lead. Sir Eustace Pedler, the proprietor of the Mill House, is spending the winter on the Riviera.” None came forth to identify the deceased lady. The inquest revealed the following particulars. Around one o'clock on January 8th, a fashionable woman with a faint foreign accent arrived at the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, real-estate agents, in Knightsbridge. She expressed interest in leasing or purchasing a residence on the Thames within close proximity to London. Several options were presented to her, including the Mill House. She identified herself as Mrs. de Castina, listing her address as the Ritz. However, no guest bearing that name was registered, and the hotel staff failed to recognize the deceased. Mrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler's gardener and caretaker for the Mill House, provided testimony. At approximately three o'clock that afternoon, a woman arrived to inspect the property. Presenting an order from the agents, she was given the keys by Mrs. James, as was customary. The residence was located a distance from Mrs. James's residence, and she did not typically accompany prospective tenants. Shortly afterward, a young man appeared. Described as tall, broad-shouldered, with a bronzed complexion and light gray eyes, he was clean-shaven and attired in a brown suit. He informed Mrs. James he was a friend of the woman examining the house but had paused at the post office to dispatch a telegram. She directed him to the property and dismissed the matter. Five minutes later, he returned the keys to her, explaining the house did not meet their requirements. Mrs. James never glimpsed the lady, assuming she had already entered. She did note the young man appeared perturbed. “He resembled a man who had seen a ghost. I thought he was taken ill.” The subsequent day, another couple toured the premises, discovering the body in an upstairs chamber. Mrs. James identified the deceased as the lady from the prior day. The real-estate agents also confirmed her as “Mrs. de Castina.” The police surgeon estimated the woman had expired approximately twenty-four hours earlier. The Daily Budget hastily surmised that the Tube victim had murdered the woman before taking his own life. However, given the man in the Tube was deceased by two o'clock, while the woman was alive and well at three o'clock, the only reasonable conclusion was that the two events were unrelated, and the order to view the Marlow residence retrieved from the deceased man's possession was merely a fortuitous occurrence. A verdict of “Premeditated Murder by an unidentified individual or individuals” was rendered. The police (and the Daily Budget) embarked on the quest to locate “the man in the brown suit.” Mrs. James was certain no one was present in the house when the woman entered, and the sole individual to access the residence until the ensuing afternoon was the young man in question, thus pointing to him as the perpetrator of Mrs. de Castina's demise. Strangled with a stout black cord, she had been caught unawares, unable to raise an alarm. Her black silk purse contained a well-stocked wallet, loose coins, an elegant lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return portion of a first-class train ticket to London. Little evidence to pursue. These were the facts disseminated by the Daily Budget, rallying the public to “Uncover the Man in the Brown Suit.” On average, around five hundred correspondents wrote in daily to claim they had identified the culprit, while tall young men with sun-kissed complexions lamented the decision to don a brown suit. The Tube accident, dismissed as coincidental, faded from public memory. But was it truly a coincidence? I harbored doubts. Undoubtedly, my partiality stemmed from the Tube incident, my personal enigma, yet a connection between the two fatalities appeared apparent to me. In both instances, an Englishman residing abroad with a tanned visage was present, among other similarities. It was the contemplation of these parallels that impelled me to take what I deemed a bold step. I made my way to Scotland Yard and demanded an audience with the individual overseeing the Mill House investigation. My request was initially misunderstood, as I inadvertently entered the department for misplaced umbrellas. Nonetheless, I was eventually ushered into a small room and introduced to Detective Inspector Meadows.",1
"I believed I was being clever as I followed him through the swaying portières. Suzanne put up a fight, but eventually agreed to carry out my plan. I arrived at my destination early the next morning and was met by a Dutchman with a car. As we drove, the sound of guns grew closer. Eventually, we arrived at a rundown building and I was ushered in to see Mr. Harry Rayburn, who seemed to recognize me. He questioned why I had fallen into the trap again, but I remained composed. Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew tried to get down to business, but I insisted on speaking with Sir Eustace Pedler. After a brief exchange, I was led to Sir Eustace, who greeted me warmly and admitted to being the 'Colonel'.",1
"""But what about the gun found at Ealing? It couldn't have been Mrs. Havering, right?"" ""No, that was Roger Havering's job, but it was a mistake on their part. It actually helped me figure things out. A man who used a gun found at the scene would have gotten rid of it immediately, not carried it all the way to London. The motive was clear - they wanted to divert the police's attention away from Derbyshire and Hunter's Lodge. The gun found at Ealing wasn't the one used to shoot Mr. Pace. Roger fired a shot with it, rushed to his club for an alibi, then quickly went to Ealing to place the parcel where it was found, and returned to town. His wife, the charming Mrs. Havering, shot Mr. Pace after dinner, reloaded the gun, and put it back, then started their little act. It's unbelievable,"" I whispered, intrigued, ""and yet..."" ""And yet it's true. Unfortunately, bringing them to justice is another story. Japp has all the details, but I'm afraid, Hastings, we might have to let Fate take care of them,"" Poirot said regretfully. ""The wicked may prosper, but always at a cost, believe me!"" Poirot's predictions came true. Japp couldn't gather enough evidence for a conviction, and Mr. Pace's fortune ended up with his murderers. However, they didn't escape justice, as news of their deaths in the Air Mail crash to Paris meant that Justice was served. ""There have been so many thefts lately,"" I noted one morning, setting down the paper. ""Poirot, maybe we should switch from detection to crime!"" ""Planning to get rich quick, are you, my friend?"" Poirot teased. ""Look at this latest heist - the million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds that vanished from the Olympia while en route to New York."" ""If only I didn't get seasick, I would love to travel on those big liners,"" Poirot mused dreamily. ""Yes, indeed,"" I agreed enthusiastically. ""They must be like floating palaces; the pools, lounges, restaurants, palm courts - it's hard to believe you're at sea."" ""I always know when I'm at sea,"" Poirot said sadly. ""But think about the geniuses traveling incognito on those ships! One would meet the criminal elite,"" he added. ""So that's what excites you! You wish you could have caught the thief who took the Liberty Bonds?"" I laughed. Our conversation was interrupted by the landlady. ""A Miss Esmée Farquhar is here to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here's her card."" Miss Farquhar, a charming young lady with big brown eyes and a perfect figure, entered the room. ""Please sit down, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who helps me with my cases,"" Poirot said. ""I have a serious problem for you, Monsieur Poirot,"" Miss Farquhar began. ""It's about the stolen Liberty Bonds on the Olympia."" Poirot's surprise was evident, prompting her to explain further. ""You're probably wondering what a girl like me has to do with the London and Scottish Bank. Well, I'm engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway."" ""Ah, and Mr. Ridgeway?"" ""He was responsible for the bonds when they were taken. It's not his fault, but it's causing him distress. His uncle, Mr. Vavasour, believes he must have mentioned having them, which has damaged his career."" ""Who is Mr. Vavasour?"" ""He's the joint general manager of the Bank. Let me tell you the whole story. The Bank wanted to expand in America, so they sent a million dollars in Liberty Bonds with Philip, who knew the New York operations well. The bonds were handed to him by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, sealed in his presence, and locked in his bag.""",1
"Nadina, a captivating Russian performer who had captivated the audience in Paris, gracefully acknowledged the applause with a bow.

Dressed in flowing blue and orange fabrics, the dancer exited the stage. A man with a beard eagerly embraced her - the Manager.",1
"At six, my father passed away. Eight years later, my mother joined him in the grave. The only kin left was my Uncle Andrew, who acquired Crabtree Manor after returning from Australia. Despite his kindness, he had firm beliefs in women's education, opposing 'book knowledge.' Our arguments were endless, especially when I won a scholarship to Girton. His will left me a year to prove my wits, challenging me to unravel the mystery of the manor. With Poirot's help, the hunt began, uncovering hidden secrets in the old house.",1
"I believe the threat is close at hand, so I urge you to swiftly travel to France. Notify me of your arrival time and I will arrange for a car to pick you up in Calais.

Your assistance will likely be needed for an extended duration, including a potential trip to Santiago, where I resided for many years. Your fee is entirely up to you.",1
"""However, the question remained - why the sudden silence from him on such a crucial issue? It was clear that Marthe had been aware from the start, explaining her anxiety and persistent inquiries to Poirot regarding any suspects. Lost in thought, I was brought back to reality by the sound of the approaching train, and soon enough Poirot was before me. His face was aglow with excitement, his joy palpable as he embraced me warmly, disregarding my typical English reserve. 'My dear friend, I have triumphed beyond measure!' he exclaimed. 'Really? That's wonderful news,' I replied, genuinely pleased.""",1
"We returned to Crabtree Manor during the early hours of the morning. Ignoring the puzzled expressions of the Bakers, Poirot headed straight to the study. ""I may have been mistaken multiple times, but now I see clearly,"" he declared. Without hesitation, he unlocked the desk and removed an envelope. I watched in disbelief, wondering how a substantial will could fit inside such a small package. Methodically, he opened the envelope and spread out its contents.",1
"""But who was he?"" Poirot asked. ""The man with the duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who miraculously recovered from severe bronchitis. Yes, that 'stodgy' old man, Mr. Shaw! Sometimes, my friend, criminals lurk in high places. Ah, we have arrived. Mademoiselle, success is mine! May I?"" Poirot beamed as he lightly kissed the astonished girl on both cheeks. Among the many adventures shared with Poirot, one of the most thrilling and dramatic was our investigation into the mysterious deaths following the opening of King Men-her-Ra's Tomb.",1
"Giraud smiled, then, shifting his position slightly, remarked: “That will be all. I believe you would rather continue the questioning, M. le juge.” “Indeed, that is correct,” replied M. Hautet. “And what led to the disagreement between you?” “I refuse to disclose,” stated M. Renauld firmly. M. Hautet sat upright in his seat. “M. Renauld, it is not acceptable to play games with the law!” he declared. “What was the cause of the argument?” Young Renauld remained quiet, his youthful countenance moody and dark. But another voice intervened, composed and collected, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I can provide the information, if you wish, M.",1
"""During a fleeting moment, Giraud's visage was veiled by an intense, almost murderous fury. Advancing two paces towards his antagonist, he was abruptly interrupted as Marchaud swung open the salon door and inquired, ""M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?"" The newcomer who crossed the threshold exuded a commanding presence. Towering in height, with a sturdy athletic build, and a deeply tanned complexion, he effortlessly captivated the room. Even Giraud appeared pallid in comparison. It wasn't long before I discerned that Gabriel Stonor possessed a truly remarkable persona.""",1
"""Lucas!” He grabbed my arm, his grip so strong that it made me flinch. “Where did you hear that name?” he asked hoarsely. “Is it yours?” I asked sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called 'The Man in the Brown Suit'?” He was taken aback. He let go of my arm and stepped back. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he whispered. “I'm a friend,” I said, taking a step towards him. “I offered you help once, I offer it again. Will you accept it?” His response was fierce. “No. I want nothing to do with you or any woman. Do your worst.” My temper flared up. “Maybe you don't realize how much power I have over you? A word to the Captain” “Say it,” he sneered. Then, stepping closer: “And while we're at it, my dear, do you realize you're in my power right now? I could grab you by the throat like this.” With a quick motion, he demonstrated. I felt his hands on my throat, applying just a little pressure. “Like this, and squeeze the life out of you! And then, like our friend here, but with more success, toss your dead body to the sharks. What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet, I knew the danger was real. In that moment, he despised me. But I reveled in the danger, in the feeling of his hands on my throat. I wouldn't trade that moment for anything in the world. With a short laugh, he let go. “What's your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does anything scare you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I replied, pretending to be calm. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He chuckled. Then, he nudged Pagett's unconscious body with his foot. “What should we do with this mess? Toss it overboard?” he asked casually. “If you want,” I replied calmly. “I admire your bloodthirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we'll leave him to recover at his own pace. He's not seriously injured.” “You shy away from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked puzzled. “The woman in Marlow,” I reminded him. An ugly expression crossed his face. He seemed to have forgotten I was there. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I think I meant to kill her.” A surge of hatred for the dead woman washed over me. I could have killed her in that moment, if she were there. For he must have loved her once, he must have, to feel that way! I regained control and spoke normally: “I think we've said all there is to say. Good night.” “Good night and goodbye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Until we meet again, Mr. Lucas.” He winced at the name. He came closer. “Why do you say 'until we meet again'?” “Because I have a feeling we will,” I said, unable to explain why. “I never want to see you again,” he said suddenly and forcefully. It was rude, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, then stop, and a word drifted down the deck. I think it was ""witch""!",1
"""Sir Laurence Eardsley wielded great power. He managed to have the charges dropped, but it resulted in the ruin of two young men who now bore the shame of being labeled as thieves. It was a heavy blow for the elderly man, his heart shattered by the outcome. A bitter confrontation ensued between father and son, where harsh words were exchanged. Despite Sir Laurence's efforts to protect the family reputation, his son was forever estranged. The young man, full of pride and stubbornness, chose to remain silent, refusing to defend himself against his father's accusations.""",1
"After listing off dates, prices, and names of unfamiliar places, they finally finished checking and counting. ""Excellent,"" declared Chichester, the scraping of his chair indicating his departure. ""I will bring these to show the 'Colonel'."" ""When are you leaving?"" ""Ten o'clock tomorrow morning works for me."" ""Do you wish to visit the girl before your departure?"" ""No. It's strictly forbidden for anyone to see her until the 'Colonel' arrives. Is she doing well?"" ""I peeked in on her during dinner. I believe she was fast asleep.""",1
"""I hesitated to linger at the Falls, worried he may have taken you nearby, but was unsure how to handle the diamonds. I was too scared to hold onto them,"" Suzanne glanced nervously around, checking for eavesdroppers, then leaned in close to whisper urgently. ""A wise decision,"" I agreed. ""At the moment, anyway. It's complicated now. Where did Sir Eustace send the cases?"" ""The large ones were shipped off to Cape Town. Pagett informed me before I departed the Falls, and he included the storage receipt.""",1
"""Can you estimate his height? Maybe around six feet?"" ""I believe so."" ""He was completely clean-shaven, correct?"" ""Yes, not a trace of a moustache."" ""Did his chin have a shiny appearance?"" I inquired suddenly. Mrs. James gazed at me in astonishment. ""Come to think of it, miss, it did. How did you know?"" ""Interestingly, murderers often have shiny chins,"" I declared excitedly. Mrs. James took my word seriously. ""Is that so, miss? I had no idea."" ""Did you notice anything distinctive about his head?"" ""Just a regular head, miss.""",1
"As the Revolution finally subsided, Colonel Race arrived in Cape Town. Following his suggestion, we all moved into the grand villa in Muizenberg once owned by Sir Lawrence Eardsley. Plans were made for my return to England with Suzanne, where we would marry at her London home. The trousseau was to be purchased in Paris, a task that Suzanne took great pleasure in organizing. Despite the excitement, the future appeared strangely distant. At times, a suffocating sensation gripped me, leaving me breathless. On the eve of our departure, sleep eluded me.",1
"""But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy."" Mrs. Maltravers allowed him to guide her to a chair. Despite her red, tear-stained eyes, her exceptional beauty remained undisguised. A woman of around twenty-seven or twenty-eight, fair-skinned with striking blue eyes and a charming pout. ""Is this about my husband's insurance, then? Must I deal with this so soon?"" ""Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband had a substantial life insurance policy, and in such cases, the Company needs to verify a few details. They have authorized me to represent them. Rest assured, I will make this process as painless as possible for you. Can you tell me briefly what happened on Wednesday?"" ""I was getting ready for tea when my maid informed me that one of the gardeners had rushed to the house. He found..."" Her voice trailed off. Poirot squeezed her hand sympathetically. ""I understand. Enough! Did you see your husband earlier that afternoon?"" ""Not since lunch. I went down to the village for stamps, and I believe he was out in the grounds."" ""Shooting rooks, was he?"" ""Yes, he usually took his rook rifle with him, and I heard a couple of shots in the distance."" ""Where is this rook rifle now?"" ""I believe it's in the hall."" She led Poirot to the weapon, which he quickly examined. ""Two shots fired, I see,"" he remarked before handing it back. ""And now, madame, if I may see..."" He paused tactfully. ""The maid will show you,"" she whispered, turning away. The parlourmaid led Poirot upstairs, leaving me with the beautiful but unfortunate woman. It was difficult to decide whether to speak or remain silent. I attempted a few general remarks, to which she responded absentmindedly, until Poirot returned to us shortly after. ""Thank you for your cooperation, madame. I believe you needn't worry about this matter any longer. By the way, do you know anything about your husband's finances?"" She shook her head. ""I'm not very knowledgeable about business matters."" ""I see. So you can't shed any light on why he suddenly decided to take out a life insurance policy? He hadn't done so before, correct?"" ""We had only been married for a little over a year. But he took out the policy because he was convinced he wouldn't live long. He had a strong feeling he was going to die soon. He had already had one hemorrhage, and he was certain another would be fatal. I tried to reassure him, but it was in vain. Unfortunately, he was right."" With tears in her eyes, she bid us a graceful farewell. As we walked down the driveway together, Poirot made a characteristic gesture. ""Well, that's that! Back to London, my friend, it seems there's no mystery to solve here. And yet..."" ""And yet what?"" ""A small discrepancy, that's all! Did you notice it? No? Nevertheless, life is full of inconsistencies, and surely the man couldn't have taken his own life - there's no poison that would cause him to bleed from the mouth.""",1
"""I understand,” conceded his companion. “However, they could not have accomplished this without leaving marks in the flower-bed.” I grasped the validity of his statement. Two large oval flower-beds filled with scarlet geraniums were situated on either side of the staircase leading to the front entrance. The tree in question had its roots directly behind the bed, making it impossible to approach without stepping on it. “You see,” the inspector continued, “due to the dry conditions, no prints would be visible on the driveway or paths; but on the soft soil of the flower-bed, it would be a different story.” Poirot approached the bed and examined it closely. As Bex had mentioned, the soil was completely smooth. There was not a single indentation to be found. Poirot nodded in apparent agreement, and we moved away, but suddenly he veered off and started inspecting the other flower-bed. “M. Bex!” he called out. “Come here. There are plenty of tracks for you to see.” The inspector joined him and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are undoubtedly the footprints of the gardener's large boots. In any case, it would not matter, as on this side there is no tree, and thus no way to access the upper floor.” “Indeed,” Poirot muttered, looking disappointed. “So you believe these footprints are insignificant?” “Not at all.” Then, to my surprise, Poirot declared: “I beg to differ. I have a small suspicion that these footprints are the most crucial things we have encountered so far.” M. Bex remained silent, merely shrugging his shoulders. He was too polite to express his true opinion. “Shall we continue?” he inquired instead. “Of course. I can look into the matter of the footprints later,” Poirot said cheerfully. Rather than following the driveway to the gate, M. Bex turned onto a path that branched off at a right angle. It wound up a gentle slope, curving to the right of the residence, and was flanked on both sides by a type of shrubbery. Suddenly, it opened up into a small clearing with a view of the sea. A bench had been placed there, and not far off stood a somewhat dilapidated shed. A few steps ahead, a neat row of small bushes marked the edge of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed through them, and we found ourselves on a vast expanse of open downs. I glanced around and spotted something that filled me with surprise. “This is a golf course,” I exclaimed. Bex nodded. “The boundaries are not finished yet,” he clarified. “It is hoped that they will be ready to open next month. Some of the workers who were busy with the construction found the body early this morning.” I gasped. A little to my left, where I had momentarily overlooked it, was a long narrow trench, and beside it, face down, lay the body of a man! For a moment, my heart skipped a beat, and I had a fleeting fear that the tragedy had been repeated. But the inspector dispelled my notion by moving forward with an annoyed exclamation: “What have my officers been doing? They were strictly instructed not to allow anyone near the area without proper authorization!” The man on the ground turned his head. “But I do have the appropriate credentials,” he remarked, rising slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” exclaimed the inspector. “I was not aware that you had arrived. The examining magistrate has been eagerly awaiting your presence.” While he spoke, I observed the newcomer with great curiosity. The renowned detective from the Paris Sûreté was someone I knew of by reputation, and I was fascinated to see him in person. He was quite tall, around thirty years old, with auburn hair and a moustache, carrying himself in a military manner. There was a hint of haughtiness in his demeanor, indicating his awareness of his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a fellow investigator. A glint of interest appeared in the detective's eye. “I recognize your name, M. Poirot,” he remarked. “You were quite prominent in the past, weren't you? However, methods have evolved significantly since then.” “Crimes, on the other hand, remain largely the same,” Poirot remarked gently. It was evident to me that Giraud was prepared to be antagonistic. He was displeased at the association with the other investigator, and I sensed that if he came across a crucial clue, he would likely keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate,” Bex began. But Giraud rudely interjected: “The examining magistrate is irrelevant! The lighting is what matters. In half an hour or so, it will be gone for practical purposes. I am well-versed in the details of the case, and the individuals at the house can manage until tomorrow, but if we are to uncover a lead on the perpetrators, this is where we will find it. Have your officers been trampling all over the place? I assumed they were more competent nowadays.” “Certainly they are. The marks you are objecting to were made by the workers who discovered the body.” The other detective grunted in frustration. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge, but they were clever. You can just about make out the central footprints as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been deliberately erased. Not that there would be much to see on this hard ground anyway, but they were taking no chances.” “The external sign,” Poirot remarked. “That is what you are searching for, correct?” The detective stared. “Exactly.” A faint smile played on Poirot's lips. He seemed about to speak, but held back. He bent down to where a shovel lay. “That is what was used to dig the grave, undoubtedly,” Giraud remarked. “But you will not glean anything from it.",1
"I jumped up. Harry was waiting on the veranda outside. ""Get dressed, Anne, and come out. I need to talk to you."" I quickly threw on some clothes and stepped into the crisp night air, calm and fragrant, with its smooth texture. Harry motioned for me to follow him away from the house. His face was pale, his eyes intense. ""Anne, do you remember telling me once that women do things they dislike for someone they care about?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, curious about what was coming next. He pulled me close. ""Anne, come with me tonight. Back to Rhodesia, back to the island. I can't handle all this nonsense anymore. I can't wait for you any longer."" I pulled away for a moment. ""What about my French dresses?"" I teased. Harry never knew when I was joking or serious. ""Forget the dresses. I don't want to dress you up. I'm more likely to want to undress you. I can't let you go. You're mine. If I let you leave, I might lose you. You're coming with me tonight, no matter what."" He embraced me tightly, kissing me fiercely. ""I can't be without you any longer, Anne. I can't. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let's go."" ""My toothbrush?"" I hesitated. ""You can buy one. I know I'm crazy, but please, come!"" He stormed off, with me following quietly like the Barotsi woman I once saw at the Falls. Except, I wasn't balancing a frying pan on my head. He walked so fast that I struggled to keep up. ""Harry,"" I finally said, meekly, ""are we walking all the way to Rhodesia?"" He turned abruptly, laughing loudly as he scooped me up in his arms. ""I'm mad, my love, I know. But I adore you so much."" ""We're both insane. And, oh, Harry, you never asked, but I'm not making a sacrifice at all! I wanted to come!"" And that was two years ago. We still reside on the island. In front of me, on the rugged wooden table, lies the letter Suzanne sent me. Dear Babes in the Wood Dear Lunatics in Love, I'm not surprised at all. As we chatted about Paris and dresses, I sensed that it wasn't real, that you'd one day vanish to get married in the gypsy tradition. But you're both lunatics! This idea of giving up a vast fortune is ridiculous. Colonel Race wanted to debate, but I convinced him to let time settle it. He can manage the estate for Harry perfectly. Honeymoons don't last forever, you're not here, Anne, so I can say that without you pouncing on me Love in the wild will last a long time, but eventually you'll start dreaming of mansions in Park Lane, luxurious furs, Parisian gowns, top-notch cars, and fancy baby carriages! Oh, you will! Enjoy your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and may it be a long one. And think of me occasionally, gaining weight amidst the indulgences! Your dear friend, Suzanne Blair. P.S. I'm sending you a variety of frying pans as a wedding gift, and a large terrine of pâté de foie gras to remind you of me. Another letter occasionally catches my eye. It arrived long after the first, accompanied by a large package. It seemed to be sent from somewhere in Bolivia. My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I couldn't resist writing to you, not because I enjoy writing, but because I know it will bring you great joy. Our friend Race wasn't as smart as he believed, was he? I think I'll make you my literary executor. I'm sending you my diary. There's nothing in it that would interest Race and his group, but I suspect there are bits that will amuse you. Feel free to use it as you wish. I recommend an article for the Daily Budget, ""Criminals I have met."" I only request to be the central figure. By now, you're probably not Anne Beddingfeld anymore, but Lady Eardsley, living it up in Park Lane. I just want to say that I hold no grudge against you. It's hard, of course, to start over at my age, but, between us, I had a little nest egg saved for such a time. It has been very helpful, and I'm building a nice little business. By the way, if you ever run into your funny friend, Arthur Minks, let him know I haven't forgotten about him, will you? That should shake him up. Overall, I think I have shown a very forgiving spirit. Even towards Pagett. I heard that he, or rather Mrs. Pagett, had a sixth child recently. Soon, England will be filled with Pagetts. I sent the child a silver mug, and, on a postcard, offered to be the godfather. I can imagine Pagett taking both the mug and postcard straight to Scotland Yard with a straight face! Bless you, my dear. One day, you'll see what a mistake you made by not marrying me. Yours always, Eustace Pedler. Harry was livid. It's the one thing we don't agree on. To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to kill me and is responsible for his friend's death. Sir Eustace's attempts on my life always puzzled me. They didn't fit the picture, so to speak. I'm convinced he always had kind feelings towards me. So why did he try to kill me twice? Harry says ""because he's a scoundrel,"" and thinks that solves it. Suzanne was more insightful. We discussed it, and she attributed it to a ""fear complex."" Suzanne is into psychoanalysis. She explained that Sir Eustace's life was driven by a desire for safety and comfort. He had a strong sense of self-preservation. The murder of Nadina removed certain inhibitions. His actions didn't reflect his feelings for me, but were driven by fears for his own safety. I believe Suzanne is correct. As for Nadina, she was the type of woman who deserved to die. Men do questionable things to get rich, but women shouldn't pretend to be in love for hidden motives. I can forgive Sir Eustace easily, but I'll never forgive Nadina. Never, never, never! The other day, I was unpacking some tins wrapped in old Daily Budget scraps, and I stumbled upon the words, ""The Man in the Brown Suit."" It felt like eons ago! I had cut ties with the Daily Budget long before it cut ties with me. My Romantic Wedding got plenty of attention. My son is playing in the sun, kicking his legs. There's a ""man in a brown suit"" if you like. He's dressed minimally, which suits Africa best, and is as tanned as can be. He's always digging in the earth. He must take after Papa. Suzanne sent a cable when he was born: ""Congratulations and love to the newest arrival on Lunatics' Island. Is his head long or short?"" I wasn't going to let that slide. I sent her a one-word reply: ""Flat-headed!"" I've heard a tale about a young writer who started his story with an attention-grabbing sentence: ""'Hell!' said the Duchess."" Oddly enough, my story begins similarly. Except the lady who uttered that exclamation wasn't a Duchess! It was a day in early June. I had been dealing with some business in Paris and was on my way back to London on the morning train. The Calais express was unusually empty my compartment had just one other passenger. I was hastily checking my belongings as the train started, not paying much attention to my companion. But she caught my eye in a startling way. Rising from her seat, she opened the window and exclaimed ""Hell!"" before pulling her head back in.",1
"""Yet the letter from Mr. Renauld? It clearly alludes to a hidden truth involving Santiago?"" ""Certainly, a concealed aspect of M. Renauld's past seems evident. However, I believe the mention of Santiago is merely a diversion, a tactic to mislead us. Perhaps it was intentionally used to divert M. Renauld's suspicions away from a closer threat. Rest assured, Hastings, the danger looming over him did not originate in Santiago, but rather much closer, within France."" His words carried a weight of seriousness and certainty that left me no room for doubt.",1
"Not forgetting the mysterious visitor from the previous night, I made a mental note to locate him on the ship before the day was out. My attention was drawn to the following individuals as they seemed significant: (1) Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of Mill House, whose appearance on the Kilmorden Castle was quite unexpected. (2) Mr. Pagett, the secretary with a sinister demeanor, who had shown great interest in securing Cabin 17. Note: Investigate his connection to Sir Eustace's journey to Cannes. (3) Reverend Edward Chichester.",1
"""We chatted casually for a while. “Miss Beddingfeld, it seems I crossed paths with your father before. He was quite a fascinating man, and his area of expertise is something I find particularly intriguing. I've dabbled in a similar field myself. Back when I was in Dordogne” Our conversation shifted to a more specialized tone. Colonel Race's knowledge was impressive. Yet, he unexpectedly made a couple of errors in his explanations, almost as if they were intentional slip-ups.""",1
"""And with what audacity, carrying on an affair in such a manner? No caution, no secrecy. Clearly English style!” I fumed silently in my chair, while the magistrate proceeded with his interrogation, unfazed by my reaction. ""So, M. Renauld did not escort Madame Daubreuil out? Did she leave on her own?"" ""Yes, sir. I heard them exit the study and head towards the door. Monsieur bid her good night and closed the door behind her."" ""At what time did this occur?"" ""Around twenty-five minutes past ten, sir."" ""Do you know when M. Renauld retired for the night?"" ""I heard him go up about ten minutes after us. The stairs creak so loud, one can hear every movement."" ""Did you hear any disturbances during the night?"" ""Absolutely nothing, sir."" ""Which servant descended first in the morning?"" ""It was me, sir. Immediately I noticed the door ajar."" ""Were the other downstairs windows secured?"" ""All of them. Nothing seemed amiss or suspicious."" ""Very well, Françoise, you may leave."" The elderly woman shuffled towards the exit. Before departing, she glanced back. ""I will reveal something to you, sir. That Madame Daubreuil is a wicked one! Oh, yes, women know about other women. She is wicked, mark my words."" With a knowing nod, Françoise exited the room. ""Léonie Oulard,"" summoned the magistrate. Léonie entered, weeping and on the verge of hysteria. M. Hautet handled her delicately. Her testimony centered on the discovery of her bound and gagged mistress, with some exaggeration. Like Françoise, she heard no sounds during the night. Her sister, Denise, followed. She concurred that her employer had been noticeably different as of late. ""Each day he grew more sullen. He ate less. He was always melancholic."" Yet Denise had her own theory. ""Certainly, it was the Mafia who pursued him! Two masked men, who else could it be? A dreadful organization!"" ""It is a possibility,"" smoothly replied the magistrate. ""Now, my dear, were you the one who let Madame Daubreuil into the house last night?"" ""Not last night, sir, the night before."" ""But Françoise just stated that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?"" ""No, sir. A lady did visit M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil."" Surprised, the magistrate probed further, but the girl stood firm. She was familiar with Madame Daubreuil's appearance. This woman was dark as well, but shorter and much younger. Her statement remained unshaken. ""Had you ever seen this woman before?"" ""Never, sir."" Then, hesitantly, she added: ""But I believe she was English."" ""English?"" ""Yes, sir. She inquired for M. Renauld in perfectly good French, but one can always detect the accent, isn't that so? Besides, when they emerged from the study, they conversed in English."" ""Did you catch any of their conversation? Were you able to understand it?"" ""I am fluent in English,"" declared Denise proudly.",1
"Inadvertently, Mademoiselle Marthe revealed the truth about another matter, contradicting Jack Renauld in the process. His noticeable pause when questioned about seeing Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime raised suspicions of deceit. To confirm my doubts, I needed to speak with Mademoiselle Marthe before Jack could warn her. Just three simple words from her provided the crucial information I sought. When I inquired if she was aware of Jack Renauld's presence that night, her response was simply, ""He informed me.""",1
"Dressed identically to his attire in London, he always kept a small clothes-brush in his pocket to combat the dust that clung to his dark clothing. “And my boots,” he lamented. “Look at them, Hastings. My boots, usually gleaming patent leather, now filled with sand both inside and out, a painful sight. In addition, this heat is causing my once impeccable moustaches to droop in defeat!” “But look at the Sphinx,” I suggested. “Even I can sense the enigmatic allure it emits.” Poirot gazed at it disapprovingly. “It appears quite unhappy,” he observed. “Partially buried in sand in such a disorderly manner, how could it not be?”",1
"""That’s what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen.” Graves finished his story. He had gone out around 8.30, meeting a friend and together they went to the Metropolitan Music Hall in Edgware Road. No one saw them leave, but the time of the murder was confirmed at 8.47. A clock on the writing-table had been knocked over by Foscatini's arm, stopping at that hour, in line with Miss Rider's phone call. The police surgeon had examined the body, now resting on the couch. I observed the face for the first time the olive skin, the long nose, the thick black mustache, and the full red lips revealing white teeth. Not a pleasant face at all. ""Well,"" said the inspector, closing his notebook. ""The case seems clear. The only challenge will be to find Signor Ascanio. I assume his address is not in the dead man's pocket-book?"" As Poirot had mentioned, Foscatini was organized. Neatly written was the inscription, ""Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel."" The inspector used the telephone, then turned to us with a smile. ""Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continent. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. It’s a grim situation, but fairly straightforward. Likely one of those Italian vendetta matters."" Dismissed casually, we headed downstairs. Dr. Hawker was thrilled. ""Like the start of a novel, right? Real gripping stuff. Hard to believe unless you read about it."" Poirot stayed silent. Throughout the evening, he barely spoke. ""What does the master detective say, eh?"" asked Hawker, patting him on the back. ""Nothing to get your brain working this time."" ""You think not?"" ""What could there be?"" ""Well, for example, there is the window."" ""The window? But it was locked. No one could have entered or exited that way. I made sure of it."" ""And why were you able to make sure?"" The doctor looked puzzled. Poirot clarified, ""I refer to the curtains. They were not drawn. A little peculiar, isn't it? And then there was the coffee. It was very dark coffee."" ""Well, what of it?"" ""Very dark,"" repeated Poirot. ""In conjunction with the fact that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, what do we have?"" ""Nonsense,"" laughed the doctor. ""You're joking."" ""I never joke. Hastings here knows I am dead serious."" ""I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,"" I admitted. ""You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been involved and spiked the coffee. I suppose they'll check his alibi?"" ""Certainly, my friend; but it's Signor Ascanio’s alibi that intrigues me."" ""You think he has an alibi?"" ""That is precisely what concerns me. I'm sure we will soon find out.""",1
"Lowen was completely unaware that he would have the opportunity to access the safe. His visit was for a job interview. Unbeknownst to him, Mr. Davenheim was out posting a letter, leaving Lowen alone in the study. ""He could have taken advantage of the situation,"" I proposed. ""But how would he have the tools to break into the safe? City men don't typically carry burglary tools around. And a penknife wouldn't do the job."" ""What about the second point?"" ""You mentioned that Lowen held a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. That implies he had bested him in the past. And any transactions between them were likely for Lowen's benefit. You don't usually hold a grudge against someone you've outsmarted. If anything, the grudge would be on Mr. Davenheim's side."" ""But he did lie about never leaving the study, didn't he?"" ""True. But he may have been scared. Especially considering the discovery of the missing man's clothes in the lake. Still, honesty would have been the better choice."" ""And the final point?"" ""I agree. If Kellett's account is accurate, Lowen is definitely involved. That's what makes this case so intriguing."" ""So, I did grasp a crucial detail?"" ""Perhaps, but you've missed the two most significant points that hold the key to this mystery."" ""And what are they?"" ""First, Mr. Davenheim's recent obsession with buying jewelry. And second, his trip to Buenos Ayres last fall."" ""Surely you can't be serious, Poirot!"" ""I am indeed. Ah, by the heavens, let's hope Japp doesn't forget my little request."" And with that, the detective's joke led to a telegram arriving the following day. It read: ""'Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.'"" ""Aha!"" exclaimed Poirot. ""Now everything falls into place!"" As I looked at him in astonishment, he warned me, ""Do you not have money in Davenheim and Salmon's bank, my friend?"" ""No,"" I replied, puzzled. ""Why do you ask?"" ""Because I suggest you withdraw it before it's too late."" ""Why? What do you foresee?"" ""A significant collapse in a few days, perhaps sooner. Let's send a message to Japp as well. A pencil and paper, please. There we go! 'Advise you to withdraw any funds deposited with the firm in question.' That will pique his interest, the good Japp! He won't understand until tomorrow, or the day after!"" Despite my doubts, the next day proved Poirot's incredible foresight. The newspapers were filled with headlines about the dramatic downfall of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the renowned financier now took on a whole new meaning with the exposure of the bank's financial troubles.",1
"""Anne, it appears you've encountered your match. But remember, the path of righteousness doesn't always lead to victory."" Suddenly, the sound of splintering wood filled the air as footsteps thundered up the staircase. Harry swiftly unlocked the door. Colonel Race burst into the room, a look of relief washing over his features. ""You're safe, Anne. I was worried,"" he reassured her before turning his gaze to Sir Eustace. ""I've been on your trail for a while, Pedler, and now I've finally caught up with you."" Sir Eustace chuckled lightly, ""It seems everyone has lost their minds. These youngsters have been waving guns at me and hurling the most absurd accusations.""",1
"It was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. Only” “Yes?” “Eh bien, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to make up as himself again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right. He went to the boathouse, donned his ‘tramp’ clothes, which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped the others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a policeman, getting himself safely into the haven of Bow Street, where nobody would ever dream of looking for him!” “It’s impossible,” murmured Japp. “Ask Madame,” said my friend, smiling. The next day a registered letter lay beside Poirot’s plate. He opened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friend’s brow puckered. “Ah, sacré! But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse! Ce pauvre Japp! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we three! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I, who would not rob a child mille tonnerres! Mon ami, what have you, that you laugh so heartily?” Poirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near neighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. It was the genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer. The doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree, admired the talents so far removed from his own. On one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. It must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room. “Oh, doctor, you’re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a turn, it did indeed.” I recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker’s housekeeper, Miss Rider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence. “What terrible voice? Who is it, and what’s the trouble?” “It was the telephone, doctor. I answered it and a voice spoke. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor help. They’ve killed me!’ Then it sort of tailed away. ‘Who’s speaking?’ I said. ‘Who’s speaking?’ Then I got a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘Foscatine’ something like that ‘Regent’s Court.’” The doctor uttered an exclamation. “Count Foscatini. He has a flat in Regent’s Court. I must go at once. What can have happened?” “A patient of yours?” asked Poirot. “I attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian, but he speaks English perfectly. Well, I must wish you good night, Monsieur Poirot, unless” He hesitated. “I perceive the thought in your mind,” said Poirot, smiling. “I shall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get hold of a taxi.” Taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon bowling along in the direction of Regent’s Park. Regent’s Court was a new block of flats, situated just off St. John’s Wood Road. They had only recently been built, and contained the latest service devices. There was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell impatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply. “Flat II. Count Foscatini. There’s been an accident there, I understand.” The man stared at him. “First I’ve heard of it. Mr. Graves that’s Count Foscatini’s man went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.” “Is the Count alone in the flat?” “No, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.” “What are they like?” I asked eagerly. We were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on which Flat II was situated. “I didn’t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were foreign gentlemen.” He pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing. No. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell. There was no reply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang again and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no sign of life rewarded us. “This is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. He turned to the lift attendant. “Is there any pass-key to this door?” “There is one in the porter’s office downstairs.” “Get it, then, and, look here, I think you’d better send for the police.” Poirot approved with a nod of the head. The man returned shortly; with him came the manager. “Will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?” “Certainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying. You can understand that we must lose no time if we are not already too late.” The manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered the flat. We passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the right of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod. “The dining-room.” Dr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we entered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though their occupants had just risen. In the corner, to the right of the fire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man or what had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the telephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the base of it stained with blood. The doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “Stone dead. Must have been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to telephone.",1
"I was taken aback to discover that she truly cared for me. I had assumed I was just a passing fancy, but she embraced me warmly and wept when we reunited. After composing ourselves, I sat down and recounted the entire story to her. ""You always suspected Colonel Race,"" she mused once I had finished. ""I didn't until the night you vanished. I had always liked him and thought he would be a good match for you. Oh, Anne, dear, how can you be sure that your young man is telling the truth? You believe everything he says."" ""I trust him completely,"" I retorted. ""But what is it about him that draws you in? All I see is his daring good looks and his modern approach to romance."" I vented my frustrations at Suzanne for a few moments. ""You seem to have forgotten about romance since you got married and gained weight,"" I concluded. ""Oh, I'm not gaining weight, Anne. The worry about you has worn me down,"" Suzanne replied sadly. ""You look quite well-fed,"" I remarked coolly. ""And I'm not sure I'm as content in my marriage as you think."" As Suzanne lamented her marital issues, I couldn't help but feel indifferent. She would handle Clarence just fine. Shifting the conversation to the diamonds, Suzanne explained her concerns. ""I was afraid to keep them in my possession,"" she whispered to me anxiously. ""A wise decision,"" I agreed. ""But what did Sir Eustace do with the cases?"" As Suzanne answered, I considered the situation carefully. ""It's inconvenient but secure. Let's not act for now,"" I concluded. Suzanne smiled at my reluctance to remain idle. ""You dislike inactivity, don't you, Anne?"" she observed. ""Not particularly,"" I admitted. The only action I could take was to check the train timetable to find Guy Pagett's arrival time in Kimberley. His train was due at 5.40 the next day. The situation in the Rand was dire, and I needed to speak with Pagett soon. The arrival of a telegram from Johannesburg provided a brief distraction. It read: ""Arrived safely. All is well. Eric is here, as is Eustace, but not Guy. Stay put for now. Andy."" The message indicated that I had to wait until I could meet Pagett. Suzanne busied herself sending a comforting cable to Clarence. She grew sentimental towards him, expressing her longing for his presence. As she applied face cream, Suzanne mentioned her desire for more from Paris. ""You'll tire of South Africa and adventure soon,"" I predicted. ""I wish for a nice hat,"" Suzanne admitted. ""Shall I join you in meeting Guy Pagett tomorrow?"" I declined, opting to meet him alone. And so, the next day, I found myself at the hotel entrance struggling with a stubborn parasol, while Suzanne relaxed in her room. The train arrived slightly late, and I spotted Pagett among the passengers. Approaching him, I asked about his whereabouts on January 8th.",1
"""Unfortunately, the Prime Minister’s vehicle inexplicably veered off the main road,” Poirot interjected. “Around a bend in the road?” “Yes, but how did you surmise that?” “Oh, it’s obvious! Please, go on.” Lord Estair continued, “Without explanation, the Prime Minister’s car departed from the main road. Meanwhile, the police vehicle, oblivious to the detour, stayed on the main route. Further along the deserted path, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly halted by a group of masked individuals. The driver” Poirot mused, “That courageous O’Murphy!”",1
"""However, she found solace in his lack of dismissal towards her fears. Surprisingly, I had never imagined Poirot to possess such a strong belief in superstitions. Bringing up the topic on our way back, his demeanor was serious. 'Indeed, Hastings. I have faith in these matters. Superstition holds significant power.' 'So, what's our next move?' 'Always practical, dear Hastings! Well, first things first, we will send a cable to New York for more information on the death of young Mr. Bleibner.' With that, he promptly dispatched the cable. The response was detailed and to the point, revealing that young Rupert Bleibner had been struggling for years.""",1
"""It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, n’est-ce pas? What it is to be young! O jeunesse, jeunesse!” And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.” “That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least ” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M. le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “Eh bien! I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M. Hautet addressed us: “Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air. “Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “Parbleu! to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “After all, it does not matter now.” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections. “What is it that intrigues you so?” I told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully. “You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure that she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not of inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.” “You suspected her?” I cried. “But certainly! She benefits enormously in fact, by this new will, she is the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out for attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of examining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. Eh bien, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’ I had heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.” “Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly. “So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? Eh bien, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a cause célèbre unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after ” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind. “But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced. But I essayed one final objection: “And the match and cigarette end found near the body? What of them.” A light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot’s face. “Planted! Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to find! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good retriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has crawled on his stomach. ‘See what I have found,’ he says. And then again to me: ‘What do you see here?’ Me, I answer, with profound and deep truth, ‘Nothing.’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he thinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ But we shall see.…” But my mind had reverted to the main facts. “Then all this story of the masked men ?” “Is false.” “What really happened?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “One person could tell us Madame Renauld. But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my opinion.” “What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body. I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.” “Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.” “I beg your pardon, my friend one can always be mistaken. Regard a great actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment possibly with the murderer leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery.",1
"“We should bring him home, to Villa Marguerite. My mother and I will take care of him. Poor Jack!” With great effort, we managed to transport the boy to the Villa, where he collapsed into a chair, looking disoriented. Poirot checked his temperature and pulse. “He's running a fever. The stress is catching up with him. Let's get him to bed, while Hastings and I call for a doctor.” A doctor arrived promptly. Following a thorough examination, he concluded that it was just a matter of nerve strain.",1
"Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings were announced by the butler, entering to find Lady Yardly and her two children in a picturesque scene. Lady Yardly, with her dark head proudly bent over her fair children, looked up in surprise as her husband sought guidance from Poirot. The detective quickly explained his presence, apologizing for his ongoing investigation into Miss Marvell's affair. Checking on the security of the premises before Miss Marvell's arrival on Friday was his primary objective. Lord Yardly stood nearby, smiling down on his family, as the butler made the introductions.",1
"""The evidence in both cases clearly points to the same conclusion."" ""So, you're suggesting that Madame Beroldy escaped justice? That she was, in fact, involved in her husband's murder?"" I gazed at him in disbelief. ""Absolutely! Don't you agree?"" Poirot paced to the far end of the room, absentmindedly adjusting a chair before speaking slowly. ""Indeed, that is my belief. However, it's not a certainty, my dear friend. Legally speaking, Madame Beroldy is not guilty."" ""Of that specific crime, maybe. But not of others.""",1
"""And what about Carton?""""Never mind him. He caught us with Nadina in Kimberley that one evening, but he couldn't tell us apart. I convinced him I was Lucas, and Nadina fell for it too. She never feared Lucas, he was too quiet and reserved. But I, I had a fiery temper. If she knew I was back, she would've been terrified.""""Harry, if Colonel Race hadn't intervened, what was your plan?""""To stay silent. Keep up the charade as Lucas.""""And the inheritance from your father?""""Let Race have it. He would put it to better use than I ever could.""",1
"""But why the delay? What is holding you back?” “I am awaiting the arrival of the Olympia. She is scheduled to return from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you already know the identity of the bond thief, why the hesitation? He might elude capture.” “Escape to a remote South Sea island with no extradition laws? No, my friend, life would be far from pleasant for him there. As for the reason behind my waiting, well, to the keen intellect of Hercule Poirot the solution is crystal clear, but for those less astute like Inspector McNeil, it may be prudent to conduct some inquiries to confirm the details. It is important to show compassion for those who lack the same level of insight.”",1
"Poirot examined the spade and gloves that belonged to Renauld, the victim of the crime. He noted the attention to detail in the planning of the murder, with the killer using Renauld's own dagger and spade to avoid leaving traces. Giraud, the Paris detective, was focused on the ground while Poirot took interest in a piece of lead-piping nearby. Despite Giraud's dismissal, Poirot found it intriguing. As they continued their investigation, Poirot questioned the significance of a whitewashed line around the grave, revealing his unique approach to solving the case.",1
"""Remember, not a word of this to Giraud,"" I cautioned Poirot. ""He seems to dismiss me as inconsequential. But we'll see about that. I did drop a hint to him, out of common decency. If he chooses to ignore it, that's on him."" Poirot nodded, trusting in my discretion. ""Very well then, let's engage our little grey cells. Do you have an estimate of when the tragedy occurred?"" I replied, ""Around two o'clock, I believe."" Poirot raised an eyebrow in surprise. ""Yes, Mrs. Renauld mentioned hearing the clock chime while the men were present in the room.""",1
"""There was clearly going to be tension between the examining magistrate and the detective leading the case. They clashed from the beginning. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were incompetent, while M. Hautet, who was very serious, took offense at the laid-back attitude of the Paris detective. “Well, M. Giraud,” the magistrate said sharply. “I assume you have made great progress? You already know who the killers are, correct? And you also know exactly where they are hiding now?” Unfazed by the sarcasm, Giraud answered: “I at least know where they originated from.""",1
"""I regret to inform you, Monsieur, that Poirot is indisposed with influenza,"" I informed him. His countenance darkened. ""Good Lord, this is a devastating blow to me."" ""Is the matter you wish to discuss with him of grave importance?"" ""Absolutely! My uncle, my closest friend, was brutally murdered last night."" ""Here in London?"" ""No, in Derbyshire. Upon receiving a telegram from my wife this morning, I hastened to seek Monsieur Poirot's assistance with the case."" ""Allow me a moment,"" I interjected, struck by a sudden thought. I hurried upstairs to brief Poirot on the situation in a few concise words. He cut me off. ""Understood. You wish to investigate yourself, is that correct? Well, why not? You are familiar with my methods. I only ask that you provide me with detailed daily reports and strictly follow any instructions I may send."" I readily agreed. An hour later, I found myself seated across from Mr. Havering in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, swiftly departing from London. ""To start, Captain Hastings, Hunter's Lodge, the scene of the tragedy, is a small shooting-box nestled in the Derbyshire moors. Our main residence is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town. Hunter's Lodge is managed by a capable housekeeper, with our own Newmarket servants joining us during the shooting season. My uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace, has resided with us for three years. While he and my father and brother did not see eye to eye, my uncle and I got along well. He was demanding but not difficult, and we lived harmoniously. Two days ago, my uncle suggested we visit Derbyshire for a brief respite. I had to return to London yesterday, leaving my wife and uncle behind. This morning, I received a telegram."" He passed it to me: ""Come at once uncle Harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do come Zoe."" ""You are not yet aware of the details?"" ""No, but I expect the evening papers to have information. The authorities are likely involved."" When we reached Elmer's Dale station around three o'clock, we proceeded to a small grey stone building amidst the rugged moors. ""A desolate place,"" I remarked, feeling a chill. Havering nodded. ""I intend to rid myself of it. I could never reside here again."" As we approached the gate, a familiar figure emerged to greet us. ""Japp!"" I exclaimed. The Scotland Yard inspector greeted me amiably before turning to Mr. Havering. ""Mr. Havering, correct? I've been sent from London to take charge of this case. Might I have a word with you, sir?"" ""My wife"" ""I've spoken with your wife and the housekeeper. I won't detain you long, but I would appreciate your insights. Captain Hastings here knows me, and he will inform the household of your arrival. By the way, where is the little man, Captain Hastings?"" ""He's unwell with influenza."" ""Is that so? A case of the cart without the horse, you being here without him, isn't it?"" With that, Japp ushered me into the house. After a brief wait, a middle-aged woman in black opened the door. ""Mr. Havering will join us shortly,"" I explained. ""I have come from London with him to investigate the case. Could you give me a brief account of last night's events?"" ""Please come inside, sir,"" she replied, leading me into the dimly-lit hall. ""It was after dinner when the man arrived, sir. He inquired to see Mr. Pace, and, as he spoke similarly to Mr. Pace, I assumed he was an American acquaintance and directed him to the gun-room. Shortly after, I informed Mr. Pace, who went to meet him. The man did not provide a name, which, in hindsight, struck me as odd. Mr. Pace appeared puzzled but proceeded to the gun-room. I returned to the kitchen but soon heard raised voices, as though an argument ensued. I rushed to the hall, coinciding with Mrs. Havering's arrival. A gunshot followed, and an eerie silence descended. We both hurried to the gun-room door, finding it locked. We circled the house to reach the window, which was ajar. Inside, we discovered Mr. Pace, shot and bleeding."" ""Where did the man go?"" ""He must have escaped through the window before we arrived."" ""And then?"" ""Mrs. Havering dispatched me to summon the police, a five-mile journey by foot. They arrived, and a London police officer came this morning."" ""Can you describe the man who visited Mr. Pace?"" After pondering, she replied, ""He had a black beard, appeared middle-aged, and wore a light overcoat. Aside from his American accent, I did not notice much else."" ""I understand. Might I speak with Mrs. Havering?"" ""She is upstairs, sir. Shall I inform her?"" ""Please do. Let her know that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that I, the gentleman accompanying him from London, wish to speak with her promptly."" ""Very well, sir."" Impatient to uncover the truth, I eagerly awaited Mrs. Havering's arrival. A short while later, a striking young woman descended the stairs. Clad in a vibrant jumper and a leather hat, she exuded vitality despite the tragic circumstances. After our introductions, she expressed her readiness to answer any questions. ""What time did the man arrive?"" I inquired. ""Just before nine o'clock. We had finished dinner and were enjoying coffee and cigarettes."" ""Your husband had already departed for London?"" ""Indeed. He left for the 6.15 train."" ""Did he travel to the station by car or on foot?"" ""Our car was not present. A vehicle from Elmer's Dale garage fetched him for the train."" ""Was Mr. Pace behaving normally?"" ""Completely. He showed no signs of distress."" ""Can you provide any description of the visitor?"" ""I'm afraid I cannot. Mrs. Middleton escorted him to the gun-room, and I did not see him."" ""How did Mr. Pace react?"" ""He appeared irritated but went to meet the man. Shortly after, we heard raised voices. Upon reaching the gun-room, we found it locked. By the time we reached the window, the assailant had fled. My uncle had been shot in the head. I ensured the room remained undisturbed."" Impressed by her attention to detail, I commended her actions. ""Regarding the weapon?"" ""I can hazard a guess, Captain Hastings. Two revolvers belonging to my husband were displayed on the wall. One is missing. I notified the police, who confiscated the remaining one. They will examine the bullet to confirm."" ""May I visit the gun-room?"" ""Certainly. The police have concluded their investigation. However, the body has been removed."" She accompanied me to the crime scene. As Havering entered the hall, his wife rushed to him. Left alone, I conducted a thorough search but found no substantial leads apart from a bloodstain on the carpet. Disappointed, I took a few photographs and examined the area outside the window, but the trampled ground yielded nothing of significance. My exploration of Hunter's Lodge concluded, and I made my way back to Elmer's Dale to meet with Japp. At the Matlock Arms, Japp and I proceeded to view the body of Harrington Pace, a lean, clean-shaven man with typical American features. Shot at close range in the back of the head, it was evident he had been taken by surprise. As we departed, Japp shared his suspicions about Havering's past transgressions. We discussed the case further, analyzing the revolver found near the crime scene. With additional details to report, I penned a thorough account to Poirot before receiving a wire advising Middleton's arrest. Unfortunately, she had vanished, leaving behind only mundane belongings.",1
"There was a sudden rap at the door, and before I could even utter a word of acknowledgement, it swung open. I was taken aback by the unexpected visitor. My mind raced with images of Mr. Pagett wielding a gun, or my missionary acquaintance armed with a sandbag. However, what stood before me was a night stewardess, her face displaying curiosity and an air of respectability. ""Excuse me, miss, I thought I heard you call out,"" she remarked. ""No,"" I replied firmly. ""I did not."" ""I apologize for the intrusion."" ""It's quite alright,"" I reassured her. ""I couldn't sleep. A wash seemed like a good idea."" The words felt unfamiliar, as if self-care was a rare occurrence for me. ""I'm sorry, miss,"" the stewardess repeated, her tone apologetic.",1
"""Have you noticed Pagett's shiner? I'm done with secretaries unless I find a nice girl with liquid eyes. What about you, Miss Anne? Will you come with me to Rhodesia?"" Sir Eustace asked. ""Thank you, but I must leave for Durban tonight,"" I replied. Despite my refusal, Sir Eustace insisted, mentioning lions in Rhodesia. As he called for Pagett, I hurried Suzanne to make plans. Suzanne expressed disappointment at not being able to go to Rhodesia, but I assured her she was still going. We discussed keeping an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race, with Suzanne even suggesting confiding in the latter. I objected, wary of the consequences of involving others in our adventure.",1
"""Poirot wasted no time in confronting Captain Black as soon as he arrived at the inn. Without delay, he brought him up to our room, where we had been waiting. ""I have informed Captain Black of our purpose here,"" Poirot stated. ""I am eager to understand Mr. Maltravers' state of mind before his death, without causing unnecessary distress to Mrs. Maltravers. You were present just before the incident occurred, providing valuable insight that we seek.""",1
"Colonel Race stood up. “Good morning Lucas,” he greeted. Harry suddenly blushed deeply. “Yes, I suppose it’s time to use your true name,” I joked. But Harry's attention remained fixed on Colonel Race. “You recognize me, sir,” he finally admitted. “I have a good memory for faces. I remember seeing you when I was a child.” Confused, I interjected, trying to understand the tension between them. Colonel Race prevailed. Harry shifted his gaze. “I guess you’re right, sir. Go ahead and tell her my real name.” “Anne, this man is not Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas died during the War.”",1
"“You knew Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Maybe you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links. I saw the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon. “I fancy his back was to you but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat. You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely. “And you love me? Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which way to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!” Again I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could. “Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it and the wonder, I shall not forget no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl.",1
"And the inns suggest subtly that once the provisions run out, they will toss you onto the doorstep! Last evening, I encountered Reeves, my comrade from the Kilmorden. His nerves are shot worse than any other man I've come across. Like the rest of them, he delivers fiery speeches of great length, purely for political gain, only to regret it later. He's now running around claiming he never meant it. When I saw him, he was heading to Cape Town, where he plans to deliver a three-day speech in Dutch, defending himself and insisting that his previous statements had a completely different meaning. I am grateful that I'm not a member of the Legislative Assembly of South Africa.",1
"Monsieur Hautet turned to us and spoke, ""Our task here is completed. Monsieur Renauld, I invite you to review the evidence as it is presented to you. I have intentionally kept the proceedings informal. While some may call my methods original, I firmly believe in the value of thinking outside the box. The investigation is now in the capable hands of the esteemed Monsieur Giraud. I have full confidence that he will excel in his pursuit of justice. Madame, please accept my sincere condolences. Gentlemen, I bid you farewell.""",1
"I received instructions and approval by cable at Bulawayo. I was on the staff of the Daily Budget and had a private word of congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn. But let the world think that it was him for now. We arrived in Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. The place was disappointing and I hated the hotel. Sir Eustace was thoroughly sulky. Our wooden animals annoyed him, especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye, and a dejected tail. It had character and charm. A controversy arose as to whom it belonged me or Suzanne. We had each contributed to its purchase. Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, while I stuck to the position that I had been the first to behold its beauty. In the meantime, it occupied a good deal of our three-dimensional space. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals, and one dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off. Suzanne and I carried what we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Miss Pettigrew did not escape; a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn’t like me. Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy. She avoided me as much as she could. Her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. At the last moment, Sir Eustace backed out. He cursed the porters, the waiters at breakfast, and the whole hotel management. He would have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew, but I don’t think even he would have dared to. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I rescued our giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. After Sir Eustace backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would stay at home in case he might want her. And at the last minute, Suzanne sent a message to say she had a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone. He is a strange man. One doesn’t notice it so much in a crowd. But when one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do. That day, we drove to the Matoppos through the soft yellow-brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent except our car, which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man. The upholstery was torn, and all was not as it should be in its interior. The country changed, and great boulders appeared, piled into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I had gotten into a primitive era. Neanderthal men seemed quite real. I turned to Colonel Race and said dreamily, “There must have been giants once.” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” Colonel Race said gravely. “Simple, primitive, big that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long well, it makes one what you would call cruel. One comes to hold life and death very lightly.” “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” “No, I don’t think I do though they are, I suppose. That is, they are nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning, men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength like lions and tigers.” “And giraffes?” Colonel Race said slyly.",1
"With a stroke of brilliance, I gave it a swift kick, followed by two punches, leaving a dent on the crown and attaching a bizarre ornament reminiscent of a cubist's interpretation of a jazz vegetable. The outcome was undeniably stylish. The vegetable ornament was promptly removed, and I set out to reverse the rest of my modifications. The ""Mary"" hat reverted back to its original state, now sporting a worn-out look that only added to its dismal charm. I decided to fully embrace the image of an orphan as best as I could. As I prepared to face Mrs. Flemming, I was slightly anxious about her reaction, but I hoped my appearance would serve as a disarming distraction. Mr. Flemming appeared to share my unease.",1
"I first encountered her in the town, a woman with a sharp sense of humor that sets her apart. Despite my enjoyment of our conversations, they are often interrupted by a long-legged, stoic individual who clings to her side like a barnacle. Colonel Race, as he is known, does not strike me as someone who truly entertains her. Handsome, yes, but about as interesting as a wet rag. He fits the mold of those strong, silent types that seem to captivate female writers and young girls alike. As we departed from Madeira, Guy Pagett emerged on deck, his voice hollow as he began discussing matters of work.",1
"“Miss Beddingfeld, I was indeed there,” Pagett confessed. “I had my own reasons for being in the neighborhood.” “Sir Eustace hasn’t already told you?” “I believe he may have known for years,” Pagett continued. “He seems to take pleasure in keeping me in suspense.”As the whistle blew and passengers returned to the train, Miss Beddingfeld pressed for answers. “Why did you go to Marlow?” Pagett hesitated, then reluctantly shared his secret. Walking back to the hotel, Miss Beddingfeld received a wire with instructions to go to Johannesburg, signed by Harry. Deep in thought, she couldn’t shake off the mystery surrounding Pagett's behavior.",1
"""But I couldn't help but raise one final concern: “What about the match and cigarette end discovered near the victim's body? How do you explain that?” Poirot's face instantly brightened with amusement. “Planted! Clearly planted there as a deliberate ploy for Giraud or one of his associates to stumble upon! Giraud may be cunning, but he's no match for my intellect. He struts in, proud of his discovery. After hours of crawling on his belly, he presents his findings. ‘Look what I have uncovered,’ he boasts. And then he turns to me, eagerly awaiting my response: ‘What do you make of this scene?’ And I, with unwavering honesty, reply, ‘Nothing.’""",1
"“Who was it that Madame Renauld loved so deeply that upon discovering his lifeless body, she succumbed to a faint?” I was taken aback. “Her spouse?” I uttered. Poirot confirmed. “Her spouse, or Georges Conneau, as you wish to refer to him.” I composed myself. “But that seems highly unlikely.” “Why so ‘unlikely?’ Did we not just establish that Madame Daubreuil had leverage over Georges Conneau?” “Indeed, but” “And did she not successfully use that leverage against Mr. Renauld?” “That may be the case, however” “And do we not lack any information about M.",1
"""After indulging in soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of beef, and a rice soufflé, the time was just around eight o’clock. Unfortunately, the plates and dishes had already been washed up. The question of finger-prints did not concern Poirot, rather, he was intrigued by Count Foscatini's appetite. Did the Count consume every dish? The answer was affirmative, although the quantity remained unknown. The plates were dirty and the dishes empty, except for the rice soufflé, of which a considerable portion remained.""",1
"”I gave a slight nod. However, this enigmatic woman scowled and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the 'dignified disapproval' act. Oh, your expression! 'Not one of us,' it conveyed. And you were spot on, even though, it's quite difficult to discern these days. Not everyone can differentiate between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I've startled you once more! You've clearly been plucked from the wilderness. Not that I mind that. We could use more individuals like you. I simply detest a man who becomes impertinent. It makes me furious.” She vigorously shook her head. “What are you like when you're furious?” I asked with a grin. “A complete little demon! I don't care what I say, or what I do, for that matter! I nearly assaulted a man once. Yes, truly. He would have deserved it too. I have Italian blood. I shall land myself in trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I pleaded, “don't get angry with me.” “I won't. I liked you from the very first moment I laid eyes on you. But you appeared so disapproving that I never expected us to become friends.” “Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I'm an actress. No, not the type you're imagining, dining at the Savoy adorned with jewels, and with their photo in every paper declaring how much they adore Madame So and So's face cream. I've been performing on stage since I was a child of six tumbling.” “I apologize,” I said, confused. “Haven't you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I see.” “I'm American born, but I've spent most of my life in England. We have a new show now ” “We?” “My sister and I. A combination of song and dance, along with a bit of banter, and a touch of the old business mixed in. It's quite an innovative concept, and it impresses the audience every time. There's money to be made in it.” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and spoke rapidly, using many terms that were completely unintelligible to me. Yet, I discovered myself becoming increasingly intrigued by her. She appeared to be a peculiar blend of child and woman. Although completely worldly-wise, and capable, as she put it, of taking care of herself, there was still something remarkably genuine in her straightforward approach towards life, and her wholehearted determination to 'make good.' This peek into an unfamiliar world was not without its allure, and I relished seeing her lively little face light up as she spoke. We passed through Amiens. The name stirred up numerous memories. My companion seemed to have an intuitive understanding of what was on my mind. “Thinking of the War?” I nodded. “You experienced it, I presume?” “Pretty extensively. I was injured once, and after the Somme they discharged me completely. I had a half-baked Army job for a while. I'm now a sort of private secretary to an M. P.” “My! That's clever!” “No, it's not. There's actually very little to do. Usually a couple of hours each day suffices. It's also quite boring work. In fact, I don't know what I would do if I didn't have something to fall back on.” “Don't tell me you collect bugs!” “No. I share a flat with a very fascinating man. He's a Belgian, a former detective. He's established himself as a private detective in London, and he's doing remarkably well. He's truly a remarkable individual. Time and again he has been proven right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn't that fascinating, now? I just adore crime. I watch all the mysteries on the movies. And when there's a murder, I devour the newspapers.” “Do you recall the Styles Case?” I inquired. “Let me think, was that the elderly lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot's first major case. Undoubtedly, if not for him, the murderer would have gotten away unpunished. It was a remarkable piece of detective work.” Getting more engrossed in my topic, I recounted the details of the incident, leading up to the triumphant and unexpected resolution. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train pulled into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” exclaimed my companion. “Where's my powder-puff?” She proceeded to apply makeup liberally on her face, and then used a lip salve on her lips, examining the effect in a small mirror, displaying no hint of self-consciousness. “I say,” I hesitated. “I know it may seem presumptuous, but why go through all that trouble?” The girl paused in her actions, and stared at me with overt surprise. “It's not as if you aren't so pretty that you can do without it,” I said haltingly. “My dear boy! I have to do it. All the girls do. Do you think I want to appear like a frumpy country bumpkin?” She took a final look in the mirror, smiled in approval, and stowed it and her vanity box away in her bag. “That's better. Keeping up appearances can be a bit of a chore, I admit, but if a girl respects herself, it's her responsibility not to let herself go.” To this fundamentally moral sentiment, I had no response. A differing perspective makes a significant impact. I enlisted a couple of porters, and we disembarked on the platform. My companion extended her hand. “Goodbye, and I'll watch my language better in the future.” “Oh, but surely you'll allow me to accompany you on the boat?” “I may not be on the boat. I have to verify if my sister managed to board after all. But thank you nonetheless.” “Oh, but we're bound to meet again, right? I ” I hesitated. “I want to meet your sister.” We both chuckled. “That's very kind of you. I'll convey your message to her. But I doubt we'll cross paths again. You've been very kind to me on this journey, particularly after my impudence.”",1
"As I made my way to Villa Geneviève, my mood soured by the unsatisfactory turn of events, I opted for the solitude of the small bench near the shed. Lost in my thoughts, I was suddenly startled by the sound of approaching voices. It was not until the voices drew closer that I realized they were not from the garden I sat in, but from the neighboring Villa Marguerite. Amongst the voices, I distinguished the melodious tone of Marthe, the beautiful girl I knew all too well.",1
"He grasped my arm tightly. ""I've made a fool of myself, my dear friend! I could hear the love and sorrow in her voice, my little theory was completely off. Well, I must rethink everything!"" The doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman inside. The police inspector watched them, sighing. ""Poor woman,"" he muttered. ""The trauma was too overwhelming for her. There's nothing we can do now. Shall we go to the crime scene, M. Poirot?"" ""Yes, let's, M. Bex."" We made our way through the house and exited through the front entrance.",1
"""Indeed, she certainly has a past! Though not as young as before, I have observed men turning their heads as she passes by. Recently, she seems to have more money to spare, a fact well-known in town. The days of penny-pinching are over."" With an air of absolute conviction, Françoise shook her head. M. Hautet pondered, stroking his beard. ""And what of Madame Renauld's reaction to this companionship?"" he inquired. Françoise simply shrugged. ""She has always been pleasant and polite. It's as if she is completely unaware.""",1
"Mrs. Davenheim is described as a pleasant but not very bright woman, and it is mentioned that Mr. Davenheim had many financial rivals who may bear ill will towards him. A gardener saw a figure near the rose-garden, and there is speculation about suicide or foul play. Poirot examines a photograph of the missing man and finds the case to be quite obscure. Japp later reveals that Mr. Davenheim's clothes were found near the lake, and Lowen, a suspect, was seen near the study around the time of the disappearance. A pawned ring belonging to Mr. Davenheim further complicates the case. The narrative ends with the introduction of Billy Kellett, who provides a strange account of his activities on the day of the disappearance.",1
"""As we drove back from the Matoppos that day, I made a decision. And now, I can confidently say that I have followed through. The man you care for is no longer under any shadow of doubt."" ""So that was your intention all along?"" ""Yes, it was."" I felt a wave of guilt for ever suspecting otherwise. He continued, his voice filled with reflection: ""In my youth, I loved a woman who left me heartbroken. I dedicated myself to my profession after that. But when I met you, Anne, everything changed.""",1
"""I demanded, 'How could you?' Our eyes met, filled with animosity as if we were sworn enemies. It was the first time I truly observed his features: the dark, closely cropped hair, the angular jawline, the scar on his tan cheek, and the piercing light grey eyes that held a hint of daring mockery. There was an undeniable danger about him. 'You haven't even thanked me for saving your life,' I remarked, feigning sweetness. When my words struck a nerve, I relished in his visible reaction. I knew deep down that he despised being reminded of his debt to me, but I didn't care. 'I wish you hadn't,' he erupted. 'I'd rather be dead.' 'You can't deny the obligation. I saved you, and I'm waiting for your gratitude,' I countered. If looks could kill, I would have been dead on the spot. He pushed past me roughly and, before leaving, declared, 'I won't thank you now or ever. But I will repay the debt one day.' With clenched fists and a racing heart, I was left in his wake. The night passed without further incident. The next morning, I had a late breakfast in bed and ventured onto the deck. Mrs. Blair greeted me, 'Good morning, Gipsy girl. Sit with me. You look like you didn't sleep well.' 'Why do you call me that?' I inquired, taking a seat. 'Does it bother you? It suits you somehow. Ever since we met, I've thought of you that way. It's the gipsy spirit in you that sets you apart. I decided that you and Colonel Race were the only ones worth talking to on this ship.' 'That's amusing,' I replied. 'I had the same thought about you, although your charm makes it more understandable. You're quite the refined lady.' 'Well said,' Mrs. Blair acknowledged. 'Now, tell me about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you headed to South Africa?' I shared some details about my father's work. 'So you're Charles Beddingfeld's daughter? I knew you weren't just a typical girl from the countryside! Off to dig up more artifacts in Broken Hill, are you?' 'Possibly,' I answered cautiously. 'I have other plans as well.' 'You're such a mysterious creature,' Mrs. Blair mused. 'But you do look exhausted this morning. Couldn't you sleep? I can never rest on a boat. They say ten hours is plenty for a fool! I could use twenty!' As she yawned, resembling a sleepy kitten, she recounted an amusing encounter with a steward in the middle of the night. 'He woke me up to return a roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it so dramatically, sticking his arm through the ventilator and nearly dropping them on me. I thought it was a bomb!' 'Look, here comes Colonel Race,' I pointed out as the tall, soldierly man approached. 'He's not specifically my Colonel. Actually, he quite admires you, Gipsy girl. So don't escape,' Mrs. Blair teased. 'I need to tie something around my head. It's more comfortable than a hat,' I excused myself, slipping away swiftly.""",1
"“When I saw the lifeless body, resembling Jack, and dressed in his elegant overcoat, I instantly knew the truth. The same paper-knife that Jack had gifted Bella was there, with her fingerprints likely still on it. The sheer horror of that moment engulfed me, leaving me with one clear thought - I had to obtain that dagger and flee before it was discovered missing. So, I faked a fainting spell, seized the weapon while you fetched water, and concealed it in my dress. I had claimed to be lodging at the Hôtel du Phare, but in reality, I made a swift return to Calais and then sailed to England without delay. During our Channel crossing, I disposed of the dagger in the sea, finally feeling a sense of relief. Bella was at our London residence, her appearance a far cry from her usual self. After confessing my actions to her, she responded with unsettling laughter. Sensing the urgency to keep her mind occupied, we secured a new engagement promptly. Upon spotting you and your companion observing us that night, panic consumed me. Your pursuit hinted at suspicions, leading me to tail you in search of answers. To my dismay, I realized that you suspected me, not Bella, assuming I was her due to the stolen dagger. I longed for you to understand the fear and desperation I experienced at that moment. I was torn between saving myself and protecting Bella, my twin. The fear of your potential betrayal drove me to continue deceiving you, a choice that still weighs heavily on me. I should have trusted you from the start. As soon as the news broke of Jack Renauld's arrest, Bella wasted no time in fleeing. I am weary now, unable to continue writing. She initially signed the letter as Cinderella but opted for ""Dulcie Duveen"" instead. Poirot was present when I read it, his knowledge of the truth evident. The letter slipped from my grasp, prompting me to pass it to him for review. After reading it, Poirot asked what troubled me. His caring demeanor marked a change from his usual tone. Expressing my concerns was easier in this instance. The absence of a declaration of affection from her troubled me. Poirot reassured me that her feelings were evident in every line of the letter. Where to find her remained a mystery, the French stamp on the letter offering no clues. Poirot, however, promised to locate her with ease. Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, warmly greeting the young man upon his release. Jack's relief was palpable, although his weariness hinted at a looming breakdown. His sacrifice had been futile, a fact he acknowledged with sorrow. The impending legal proceedings weighed heavily on Jack's conscience as he grappled with his father’s murder and the aftermath of his actions. Poirot offered reassurance, hinting at the leniency of the French courts towards cases like his. But Jack's guilt and remorse persisted, overshadowing any potential legal consequences.",1
"“You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this attachment, madame.” “I feared it,” she replied simply. “Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is beautiful. What can you have against her?”",1
"He was a young man with a determined look in his eyes. We locked gazes, and he didn't back down. ""Okay,"" I muttered weakly. ""Just keep quiet about me coming along."" I hesitated, feeling a sense of foreboding about the situation. It seemed like a good idea to have him by my side, but I couldn't shake the feeling that trouble was on the horizon. Just when I thought things were finally settling down! As he turned to leave, I called out to stop him.",1
"""Come, my friend.” He entered the crude wooden contraption and I cautiously followed. “Are we going to gain entry to the flat?” I questioned uncertainly. Poirot’s response was not very reassuring: “Not exactly today,” he stated. Tugging on the rope, we descended slowly until we arrived at the second level. Poirot exclaimed in satisfaction when he noticed that the wooden door leading to the scullery was unlocked. “Do you see? They never secure these doors during the day. Yet anyone could climb or descend as we have. At night, yes, but not always then, and it’s against that which we are going to prepare for.” He extracted some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and immediately began working skillfully, aiming to adjust the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The process took only about three minutes. Poirot then returned the tools to his pocket, and we ascended once more to our own realm. On Monday, Poirot was absent all day, but upon his return in the evening, he sank into his chair with a contented sigh. “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little tale? A story to your liking and which will bring to mind your preferred cinema?” “Go on,” I chuckled. “I assume it’s a true story, not one of your imaginative creations.” “It is quite true. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard can attest to its accuracy, as it was through his assistance that I learned of it. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago, some crucial Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They revealed the location of some of the most vital Harbor defenses, and would hold great value to any foreign Government, such as Japan. Suspicion fell upon a young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who worked in a minor role in the Department and who was missing at the same time as the documents. Whether Luigi Valdarno was the culprit or not, he was discovered two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not found on him. Now, for some time, Luigi Valdarno had been seen with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently emerged and resided with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Little was known about the background of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she vanished abruptly around the time of Valdarno’s demise. There are suspicions that she was actually a skilled international spy who had engaged in much illicit activity under various aliases. While the American Secret Service tried to track her down, they also kept watch on certain insignificant Japanese men living in Washington. They were confident that, once Elsa Hardt had sufficiently covered her tracks, she would approach the men in question. One of them left for England suddenly a fortnight ago. So, it seems likely that Elsa Hardt is in England.” Poirot paused, then whispered: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.” “Mrs. Robinson!” I exclaimed. “Well, there is a possibility, at least,” Poirot corrected.",1
"""I'm about to share a different side of the story,"" I declared confidently. Harry's attention was unwavering as I detailed the same sequence of events chronicled in this book. The most shocking revelation for him was the revelation that the diamonds had been in Suzanne's possession all this time, a fact that had completely eluded him. After hearing his version of events, I finally understood the purpose behind Carton's clever scheme, or rather Nadina's, as I was convinced it was her ingenious plan all along. It became clear that no surprise attacks against her or her husband would lead to the recovery of the diamonds.",1
"""Why did you take the dagger?” I inquired curiously. She responded with the innocence of a child: “I was worried about fingerprints being left on it.” “But didn’t you wear gloves?” She shook her head in confusion, then whispered hesitantly: “Are you planning to turn me over to the authorities?” “Never in a million years.” Her gaze met mine, filled with uncertainty, and she timidly asked: “Why?” It was an unexpected moment for a confession of affection, and I had never envisioned love finding its way to me in such circumstances. Yet, I replied sincerely and without hesitation: “Because, my dear Cinderella, I love you.”",1
"""Baker was sent to the neighboring town to get two printed will-forms by Mr. Marsh. They signed one, but he made a mistake and had them sign again later that day. After signing the second time, Mr. Marsh went out to pay tradesmen's books. There were workmen from a Plymouth firm who had been in the house two years ago for repairs, but they couldn't remember the details. Poirot suspected a second will and a hiding place, so they decided to go to Plymouth to investigate further.""",1
"I overheard an interesting conversation between Sir Eustace and another man about cabin allocations. Sir Eustace was adamant about not sharing his cabin, which led to a heated dispute with other passengers. In the end, the purser confirmed that Cabin 17 was mine, and the others had to choose between Nos. 13 and 28. I settled in, only to be greeted by a terrible smell in the cabin - asafœtida. It seemed someone was desperate to get me out of there, but why? The mystery of Cabin 17 continued to intrigue me.",1
"""And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no such person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says."" ""It was Dickens,"" I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. ""But what do you mean, Poirot?"" ""I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.""",1
"""Your lack of manners is truly appalling,"" I remarked icily. ""I'm afraid I must bid you farewell."" He made a move towards the exit, stumbling along the way. Reacting quickly, I guided him to the sofa with a firm hand. ""Stop being foolish,"" I scolded bluntly. ""You wouldn't want to leave a trail of blood throughout the entire ship, would you?"" He appeared to grasp the logic behind my words, sitting still as I tended to his wound as well as I could. ""There,"" I declared, giving my handiwork a satisfied pat. ""That will have to suffice for now.""",1
"Anne Beddingfeld was tired of the monotony of her life. Her father, Professor Beddingfeld, was completely engrossed in studying Primitive Man, leaving Anne to handle the practicalities of everyday life. She despised anything related to Palaeolithic Man, despite her involvement in typing and revising her father's work on Neanderthal Man. The absence of her mother since childhood added to the sense of sameness in her life. But Anne always longed for some excitement, a break from the mundane routine that consumed her days.",1
"""And once again, there was nothing to be found. No balcony in sight."" ""Even if there was,"" the inspector remarked impatiently, ""I fail to see how that would be of any use to us, given that the maid claims she never left the room."" ""Of course,"" Poirot responded calmly, unfazed. ""If Mademoiselle is certain she did not exit the room."" Before he could continue, the chambermaid and the police searcher reappeared. ""Nothing,"" the searcher stated bluntly. ""Well, I should hope not,"" the chambermaid declared indignantly. ""And that French woman should be ashamed for tarnishing an innocent girl's reputation!"" ""There, there, my dear; it's all right,"" the inspector reassured, as he opened the door. ""No one suspects you.""",1
"""Obviously,” Giraud began, “I quickly uncovered the true nature of that Chilian deception. Two individuals were involved, but they were not enigmatic foreigners! It was all a smokescreen.” “Impressive work so far, my dear Giraud,” Poirot murmured. “Especially after their clever ploy with the match and cigarette butt.” Giraud glared, then continued: “Someone must have been implicated in the crime to have dug the grave. No one actually gains from the crime, but someone believed they would. I learned of Jack Renauld’s dispute with his father, and the threats he made. The motive was clear.”",1
"Pagett abruptly left the table midway through dinner, leaving me slightly irritated since I had intended to bid him farewell. However, I assumed Sir Eustace could serve the same purpose. After finishing my meal, I approached Sir Eustace. ""Farewell, Sir Eustace,"" I declared. ""I depart for Durban tonight."" Sir Eustace let out a weary sigh. ""Yes, I heard about your plans. Would you prefer some company on your journey?"" ""I would appreciate it."" ""Lovely girl. Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather join me in searching for lions in Rhodesia?"" ""Absolutely."" ""The man must be quite dashing,"" Sir Eustace remarked with a hint of sadness.",1
"Rayburn was leaning over him. ""Did you hit him again?"" I asked breathlessly. ""There was no need,"" he replied grimly. ""I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn't get it open and is shamming. We'll soon see about that. And we'll see who he is too."" With a racing heart, I approached. I had immediately realized that my attacker was a larger man than Chichester. In any case, Chichester was a flabby individual who might resort to a knife, but would have little physical strength. Rayburn lit a match. We both gasped. The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn seemed completely stunned by the revelation. ""Pagett,"" he mumbled. ""My God, Pagett."" I felt a slight sense of superiority. ""You seem surprised."" ""I am,"" he said heavily. ""I never suspected."" He suddenly turned towards me. ""And you? You're not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?"" ""No, I didn't. Nevertheless, I'm not so shocked."" He looked at me suspiciously. ""Where do you fit in, I wonder? And how much do you know?"" I smiled. ""A lot, Mr. er Lucas!"" He grabbed my arm, the force of his grip causing me to flinch. ""Where did you hear that name?"" he asked hoarsely. ""Isn't it yours?"" I asked sweetly. ""Or do you prefer to be called 'The Man in the Brown Suit'?"" That caught him off guard. He let go of my arm and stepped back. ""Are you a girl or a witch?"" he whispered. ""I'm a friend."" I took a step closer. ""I offered you my help once, I offer it again. Will you take it?"" His fierce response surprised me. ""No. I want nothing to do with you or any woman. Do your worst."" Just like before, my own temper began to rise. ""Perhaps,"" I retorted, ""you don't realize how much power I have over you? A word from me to the Captain."" ""Say it,"" he sneered. Then, stepping forward quickly: ""And while we're coming to terms, my dear, do you realize that you're at my mercy right now? I could grab you by the throat like this."" With a swift movement, he demonstrated. I felt his hands around my throat, applying slight pressure. ""Like this and squeeze the life out of you! And then, like our unconscious friend here, but with more success, toss your lifeless body to the sharks. What do you think of that?"" I said nothing. I laughed. And yet, I knew the danger was real. At that moment, he despised me. But I knew that I craved the danger, relished the feeling of his hands on my throat. I wouldn't have traded that moment for anything else in the world. With a short laugh, he let go. ""What's your name?"" he asked suddenly. ""Anne Beddingfeld."" ""Does nothing scare you, Anne Beddingfeld?"" ""Oh, yes,"" I replied, feigning composure I didn't possess. ""Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and snooty shop assistants."" He chuckled, as he nudged the unconscious Pagett with his foot.",1
"""No, Anne, you're making a grave mistake. You can't go through with this."" ""I can. It's the only way out."" ""I couldn't face Race after this. I'll take my chances, but I won't let that sly old fox escape. It's useless, Anne. I won't do it."" Sir Eustace chuckled, accepting defeat calmly. ""Well, well,"" he said. ""It seems you've met your match, Anne. But I can assure you that morality doesn't always win."" A loud crash interrupted them, followed by footsteps ascending the stairs. Harry unlocked the door, allowing Colonel Race to enter first. Relief washed over his face as he saw Anne unharmed. ""Anne, you're safe. I was worried,"" he said before turning to Sir Eustace. ""I've been tailing you for a while, Pedler, and finally, I've caught you."" ""It appears everyone has lost their minds,"" Sir Eustace remarked casually. ""These youngsters have been threatening me with guns and accusing me of absurdities. I'm clueless about it all."" ""Is that so? Because I've found the 'Colonel.' I know you weren't in Cannes on January 8th, but in Marlow. I know your plans for Nadina and now we'll prove you're guilty,"" Colonel Race declared. Sir Eustace raised an eyebrow in surprise as Colonel Race gestured towards Arthur Minks, alias Rev. Edward Chichester, who stepped forward to testify against him. Minks recounted his encounter with Nadina in Paris and how he became entangled in Sir Eustace's web of deceit. As the truth unfolded, Sir Eustace simply smirked, dismissing the accusations. ""One thing, Sir Eustace,"" I interjected. ""The tin you threw out the window didn't have the diamonds. They're hidden in the giraffe statue's stomach, safe and sound."" Sir Eustace eyed me for a moment before responding, ""I always despised that giraffe. It must have been my intuition."" The night was spent at a farm, far from the chaos of Johannesburg. I was exhausted, the recent events taking a toll on me. Despite the relief of being reunited with Harry, a sense of unease lingered between us. The next morning, I sat on the stoop lost in thought until Colonel Race approached me, breaking the silence. ""Good morning, Anne,"" he greeted me. ""Oh, it's you,"" I responded, a tinge of embarrassment coloring my cheeks. As we sat together, I couldn't shake the mixture of fear and fascination he always evoked in me. ""Any news?"" I inquired. ""Smuts will be in Johannesburg tomorrow. This rebellion won't last much longer,"" he replied. ""I wish only the instigators suffered, not the innocent caught in the crossfire,"" I mused. ""I have some other news for you,"" he continued. ""Pedler has escaped."" Despite the gravity of the situation, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of fondness for Sir Eustace, a sentiment I couldn't shake off.",1
"I trembled at the sight of Rayburn, the man with the scar who had just saved me from a dangerous attacker on the ship. As he turned to me with concern, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of relief that he was there to protect me. His presence was both comforting and intimidating, a stark contrast to the chaos that had just unfolded. My heart raced as I watched him deal with the fallen enemy, his actions swift and decisive. In that moment, I knew that I was in the presence of someone who would stop at nothing to keep me safe. And as we stood there on the deck, surrounded by darkness and uncertainty, I felt a sense of gratitude towards Rayburn, the unlikely hero who had come to my rescue.",1
"""I apologize for the inconvenience, madam. To make this process easier for you, I will ask questions and you may simply respond. When did you retire for the night yesterday?” “Around 9:30 pm, sir. I was quite fatigued.” “And your spouse?” “I believe he followed suit an hour later.” “Was he agitated or unsettled in any way?” “No, not noticeably.” “What transpired next?” “I was awoken by a hand covering my mouth. Despite my efforts to scream, it was futile. Two masked intruders were present.” “Can you provide a description of the suspects, madam?” “One was tall with a lengthy black beard, while the other was shorter and stout, with a reddish beard.”",1
"""You understand the nature of women. She's enthusiastic about the film stunt."" ""I see,"" replied Poirot. After a moment of contemplation, he quickly stood up. ""Are you heading back to Yardly Chase immediately? Good! Don't inform anyone except for expecting us there this evening. We will be there shortly after five."" ""Okay, but I'm not sure"" ""It doesn't matter,"" said Poirot kindly. ""You want me to keep your diamond safe, right?"" ""Yes, but"" ""Then just follow my instructions."" A confused nobleman exited the room. We reached Yardly Chase at five-thirty, and were led by the dignified butler to the antique panelled hall with its crackling fire.",1
"""Well,” I asked eagerly, “what are your thoughts on this, Mrs. Blair?” “I find it absolutely enthralling! First things first, please stop with the Mrs. Blair. Suzanne is much more preferable. Agreed?” “I would be delighted, Suzanne.” “Excellent. Now, let’s focus on the task at hand. You mentioned that in Sir Eustace’s secretary, not the somber Pagett, but the other one, you recognized the man who was stabbed and sought refuge in your cabin?” I confirmed. “This connects Sir Eustace to the web in two ways. The woman was killed in his residence, and his secretary was attacked at one o’clock.",1
"""They are merely new acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t suspect for a moment” Poirot gestured with his hand. “Hold on, my friend. Have I made any assumptions? All I am saying is it's an intriguing tale. And there is no clue to unravel it; except maybe the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said firmly, “but I fail to see” Poirot cut me off with a hearty laugh. Something appeared to be greatly amusing him. “And Stella means a star, correct? Brilliant!” “What in the world” “And stars provide illumination! There you have it! Relax, Hastings. Spare me the wounded pride. Come, let us head to Montagu Mansions and conduct a few investigations.""",1
"""But how did he manage to manipulate Sir Eustace? It seems like he had some leverage over him."" ""Or over Pagett,"" I proposed involuntarily. ""You don't seem to have a fondness for Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace insists that he's a highly capable and diligent young man. And, truthfully, he may be supporting him for all we know. Now, let's continue with my theories. Rayburn is the mysterious 'Man in the Brown Suit.' He had seen the paper he dropped. Therefore, deceived by the dot just as you were, he tries to reach Cabin 17 at one o'clock on the 22nd, after attempting to secure the cabin through Pagett. On his way there, someone fatally stabs him."" ""Who?"" I interrupted. ""Chichester. Yes, it all makes sense. Send a message to Lord Nasby that you have discovered 'The Man in the Brown Suit,' and your future is secured, Anne!"" ""There are a few details you've neglected."" ""What details? Rayburn has a scar, I am aware, but scars can be easily fabricated. He matches the correct height and build. What was the description of a skull that you provided to them at Scotland Yard?"" I shuddered. Suzanne was an educated woman, but I hoped she wasn't familiar with the technical terms of anthropology. ""Dolichocephalic,"" I casually replied. Suzanne appeared uncertain. ""Is that correct?"" ""Yes. Long-headed, you know. A skull where the width is less than 75 percent of its length,"" I explained smoothly. There was a moment of silence. Just as I began to relax, Suzanne suddenly asked, ""What's the opposite?"" ""What do you mean, the opposite?"" ""There must be an opposite. What do you call skulls where the breadth is more than 75 percent of their length?"" ""Brachycephalic,"" I reluctantly murmured. ""That's right. I thought that's what you said."" ""Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,"" I confidently stated. Suzanne gazed at me intently. Then she chuckled. ""You're quite the adept liar, Gipsy girl. But it would be easier if you just tell me everything now."" ""There's really nothing to say,"" I responded unwillingly. ""Isn't there?"" Suzanne said softly. ""I suppose I'll have to confess,"" I said slowly. ""I'm not ashamed of it. You can't be ashamed of something that just happens to you. That's what he did. He was disgustingly rude and unappreciative, but I think I understand. It's like a mistreated or chained-up dog; it'll bite anyone. That's what he was like - bitter and snarling. I don't know why I care, but I do. I care deeply. Just seeing him has completely upended my life. I love him. I desire him. I'll traverse all of Africa barefoot until I find him, and I'll make him love me. I'd sacrifice everything for him. I'd toil for him, serve him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him! There, now you know!"" Suzanne stared at me for a long moment. ""You're not very English, Gipsy girl,"" she finally remarked. ""There's not a trace of sentimentality in you. I've never encountered anyone who is simultaneously so pragmatic and so passionate. I'll never love anyone like that, thankfully for me, yet I envy you, Gipsy girl. It's a gift to be capable of caring. Most people cannot. But it's fortunate for your little doctor that you didn't marry him. He doesn't sound like the type who would appreciate having high explosives in the house! So, there won't be any message sent to Lord Nasby?"" I shook my head.",1
"Slowly descending the staircase, supported by Léonie's arm, Mrs. Renauld appeared with her head bandaged. The French girl was in tears, pleading with her mistress to go back to bed. ""Madame, you will harm yourself. It goes against the doctor's orders!"" Despite the pleas, Mrs. Renauld continued forward. ""Mother,"" Jack cried out, moving towards her. But she pushed him away. ""I am not your mother! You are not my son! Today, I disown you."" ""Mother,"" the boy exclaimed, shocked. There was a moment of hesitation, a hint of regret in her voice. Poirot tried to intervene, but she quickly composed herself. ""You bear the responsibility for your father's death. Your actions led to his demise. Leave my house. Tomorrow, I will ensure you never inherit a penny of his money. Make your own way in the world with the help of the daughter of your father's enemy."" With that, she slowly made her way back upstairs. We were all taken aback by this unexpected outburst. Jack Renauld, exhausted from all that had transpired, stumbled and almost fell. Poirot and I rushed to his side. ""He is overwhelmed,"" Poirot told Marthe. ""Where can we take him?"" ""Back home! To Villa Marguerite. My mother and I will care for him. Poor Jack!"" We brought the boy to the Villa, where he collapsed into a chair in a daze. Poirot checked his temperature. ""He has a fever. The stress is catching up to him. And now this added shock. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will call a doctor."" A doctor was summoned and after examining him, concluded it was just nerve strain. With rest and peace, he could recover by the next day, but any excitement could lead to brain fever. Someone should stay with him through the night. With nothing more we could do, we left him in the care of Marthe and her mother, and headed to town. It was late, and we were hungry. The first restaurant we found satisfied our hunger with an omelette and a steak. ""Now, to find a place to stay for the night,"" Poirot said after finishing the meal with coffee. We made our way to the Hôtel des Bains. Rooms were available with a view of the sea. Poirot surprised me by inquiring about Miss Robinson. ""Yes, she's in the small salon,"" we were told. Poirot smiled at me. ""I've arranged a marriage for you, Hastings."" ""What?"" ""Don't you think I want to keep the name Duveen quiet in Merlinville?"" Cinderella was waiting for us. I took her hands, silently expressing my feelings. Poirot interrupted, reminding us of the task at hand. Cinderella handed him a wrapped object she had retrieved. It was the aeroplane dagger she had thrown into the sea. ""Well done, my child,"" Poirot praised her. ""Rest now. Hastings and I have work to do. You'll see him tomorrow."" ""Where are you going?"" Cinderella asked, eager to join. ""You'll find out tomorrow,"" Poirot replied. Despite her insistence, she accompanied us. Twenty minutes later, we set off towards the Villa Geneviève. But Poirot paused at Villa Marguerite. ""I want to check on Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Cinderella, you should wait outside,"" he decided. As we approached, I pointed out Marthe Daubreuil's silhouette in a window. Madame Daubreuil welcomed us and took us to Jack's room. He was sleeping restlessly, his face flushed. Poirot inquired about the doctor. Madame Daubreuil assured us he was resting and offered us a drink. She seemed more intriguing to me now that I knew her history.",1
"""Did Renauld confide in you at all?""""Why would you assume he would confide in me?"" ""Because, madame,"" M. Hautet said with a hint of cruelty. ""A man often tells his mistress what he hides from his wife.""""How dare you!"" she exclaimed, moving closer with anger in her eyes. ""Sir, you offend me! I have nothing to say. Please leave my residence!""The lady clearly had the upper hand. We departed Villa Marguerite feeling like chastised schoolboys. The magistrate muttered to himself in frustration. Poirot appeared deep in thought. Abruptly, he snapped out of his contemplation and turned to M.",1
"January, a month filled with fog and detestable memories! ""It's all about the profit, right?"" She stood up, her graceful figure exuding arrogance and pride. ""You mentioned earlier that none of us had anything on the chief. Well, you were mistaken. I do. I, a woman, had the wit and courage - yes, it takes courage - to deceive him. Remember the De Beer diamonds?"" ""Yes, I do. At Kimberley, just before the war? I wasn't involved, and I never got the full story. It was all hushed up for some reason, wasn't it? A valuable haul."" ""Worth a hundred thousand pounds in stones. Two of us carried out the plan under the 'Colonel's' orders, of course. But that's when I saw my opportunity. The idea was to switch some of the De Beer diamonds with sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors in Kimberley at the time. Suspicions would naturally turn to them."" ""Quite clever,"" the Count remarked. ""The 'Colonel' is always one step ahead. I played my role, but I also did something he didn't anticipate. I held onto some of the South American stones, a couple of them are unique and could easily prove that they never passed through De Beer's possession. With these diamonds in hand, I have leverage over my esteemed chief. When the two young men are cleared, his involvement will be under scrutiny. I kept quiet all these years, content with the knowledge that I held this card, but now things have changed. I want my reward, and it won't come cheap - it will be substantial, I might even say overwhelming."" ""Remarkable,"" the Count said. ""And I assume you carry these diamonds with you at all times?"" His eyes scanned the room. Nadina chuckled softly. ""There's no need to assume that. I'm not foolish. The diamonds are in a secure location where nobody would think to look."" ""I never doubted your intelligence, my dear lady, but may I suggest that you're taking a risk? The 'Colonel' won't react well to being blackmailed."" ""I'm not afraid of him,"" she laughed. ""There's only one man I've ever been afraid of, and he's gone."" The man observed her intently. ""Let's hope he stays that way,"" he joked. ""What do you mean?"" the dancer demanded. The Count appeared puzzled. ""I just meant that a resurrection would complicate things for you,"" he clarified. ""Just a silly remark."" She breathed a sigh of relief. ""Oh, he's definitely dead. Killed in the war. He was someone who once loved me."" ""In South Africa?"" the Count asked casually. ""Yes, in my homeland, South Africa."" ""That's where you're from, right?"" She nodded. The visitor stood up, grabbing his hat. ""Well,"" he said, ""you know your situation better than anyone, but if I were you, I'd fear the 'Colonel' more than any jilted lover. Underestimating him is a dangerous mistake."" She scoffed. ""After all these years, do you really think I don't know him?"" ""I wonder if you truly do,"" he murmured. ""I seriously wonder."" ""I'm not a fool! And I'm not alone in this.""",1
"I approached the counter, my voice steady this time. ""Kilmorden Castle?"" I inquired. The attendant informed me that the ship was departing on the 17th from Southampton to Cape Town. ""First or second class?"" he asked. Without hesitation, I asked about the cost. ""First class, eighty-seven pounds,"" he replied. The exact amount of my inheritance! I made up my mind. ""First class,"" I confirmed, sealing my fate. The adventure awaited me. (Excerpts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)It's curious how peace always eludes me. I am a man who craves tranquility.",1
"The hallway was deserted. Without hesitation, I swiftly made my way to the door, opened it, and stepped out into the bright sunlight. I sprinted down the driveway with a sense of urgency. Once I reached the open road, I slowed my pace to a casual stroll. Onlookers gazed at me with curiosity, undoubtedly noting the layer of dust that clung to my face and clothes, evidence of my recent escapade in the attic. Eventually, I arrived at a nearby garage and entered. ""I've been in a bit of a mishap,"" I informed the attendant. ""I require a vehicle to transport me to Cape Town immediately. I have a ship to catch in Durban."" It wasn't long before my request was fulfilled.",1
"“Have you calmed down now and are you ready to share what's really going on?” I inquired. He hesitated, then replied, “I'm afraid I can't indulge your curiosity at the moment.” Disappointed, I pressed, “And why is that?” He smirked sardonically. “If you want something spread around, just tell a woman. Otherwise, keep quiet.” Feeling slighted, I retorted, “Are you implying I can't keep a secret?” His response was noncommittal. Rising from his seat, he remarked, “In any case, you'll likely have plenty to say about tonight's events.” Outraged, I exclaimed, “How dare you!”",1
"""I always knew this day would come,"" she said with a hint of sadness in her voice. ""Mother,"" pleaded the boy. ""Please, give her a chance. Marthe is not only beautiful, but kind-hearted as well. What more could you ask for?"" ""I have no personal vendetta against Miss Daubreuil,"" she replied coldly. ""But I would much rather see you with an English bride. Or, if she must be French, then not from a family with such questionable background."" The bitterness in her tone was unmistakable, revealing the deep animosity she held towards the woman who threatened to steal her son's heart. It was clear that the idea of her son falling for the daughter of her enemy was a hard pill to swallow.",1
"""Given the timing of the crime, suspicion will not fall on him. His irritation when Bella unexpectedly arrives is clear. He quickly gets rid of her to focus on his plans. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, ensuring she sticks to their story. He carefully covers his tracks, leaving clues that point back to him. He meets a grim fate on the golf links. The murder of M. Renauld has been solved, but a deeper mystery remains. Poirot's brilliance shines as he unravels the truth behind the crime. Madame Renauld's strength and sacrifice are commendable. The lead piping was meant to conceal the victim's identity. Now, the focus shifts to finding the real killer.""",1
"""You will head to Beira.” “I refuse to go to Beira,” I interjected. “You will. You will head to Beira even if I must personally escort you there and force you onto the ship. Do you believe I am made of steel? Do you believe I will endure sleepless nights, dreading they have captured you? One cannot rely on miracles forever. You need to return to England, Anne, marry, and find happiness.” “With a reliable man who will provide me with a stable home!” “It is better than facing complete ruin.” “And what about you?” His expression turned stern. “I have my tasks at the ready. Do not inquire further about them.”",1
"“Feel free to inquire about anything, Monsieur Poirot,” Willard stated. “We are completely bewildered by this odd string of events, but we truly believe it is simply a series of coincidences.” Despite his words, there was a noticeable nervousness in his demeanor. Poirot carefully observed him. “Are you truly dedicated to this task, Sir Guy?” “Absolutely. Regardless of what may occur, the work will continue. Rest assured of that.” Poirot turned to the doctor. “And what is your stance on the matter, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” the doctor drawled, “I have no intention of giving up.” Poirot responded with one of his characteristic expressive grimaces.",1
"""The possibility of Ridgeway being the thief crossed my mind,"" Poirot mused aloud. ""It would have added a touch of elegance to the case, a display of meticulous planning. However, it may not have been as delightful for Miss Farquhar."" I interjected, unable to contain my curiosity any longer. Poirot, sensing my eagerness, proceeded to analyze the situation. The sealed package had mysteriously disappeared from the trunk, leaving no trace behind, much to Miss Farquhar's dismay.",1
"After having tea, he mentioned to his wife that he needed to walk down to the village to mail some letters. He also informed her that a Mr. Lowen was expected for business. In case Mr. Lowen arrived before his return, he should be directed to the study to wait. Mr. Davenheim left the house through the front entrance, strolled down the driveway, exited through the gate, and mysteriously disappeared. He was never spotted again after that moment. ""Quite intriguing, a delightful little mystery,"" whispered Poirot. ""Please continue, my dear friend.""",1
"The accused's relations were purely platonic, which only fueled suspicions against her. Unable to become his mistress due to the man's upstanding character, Jeanne Beroldy plotted to rid herself of her husband and marry the wealthy American. Madame Beroldy remained composed and confident in the face of her interrogators. She maintained her story, insisting she was of noble lineage and a victim of a childhood switch with a fruit seller's daughter.",1
"""The master detective has not failed us yet,"" Hawker remarked, patting him on the back. ""There is always something to ponder."" ""Indeed, there is,"" he replied. ""Take, for instance, the door."" ""The door? But it was locked. No one could have entered or exited through it. I made sure of it."" ""And why were you so certain?"" The doctor appeared confused. Poirot quickly clarified. ""I am referring to the keyhole. It was not covered. Quite peculiar. And then there was the tea. It was exceptionally bitter."" ""So what?"" ""Exceptionally bitter,"" Poirot emphasized.",1
"""I will see you later,"" he said before quickly leaving the theatre. I made my way to the hotel, heading straight to the sitting-room. Ordering a whisky and soda, I sat down and stared into the empty grate, lost in thought. The door creaked open, and I turned, expecting Poirot. But to my surprise, it was Cinderella who entered. She spoke in a shaky voice, struggling to catch her breath. ""I saw you earlier with your companion. I followed you from outside. Why are you in Coventry? What were you doing tonight? Is he the detective?"" Her cloak slipped off her shoulders, revealing her stage dress underneath.",1
"There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! ""My God, Poirot!"" I cried. ""Look at her hand, her right hand. It's all red!"" Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. ""Blood,"" she cried hysterically. ""Yes, it's blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he's come back!"" Her voice died away in a gurgle. ""Lights,"" said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic.",1
"He stared at me with a smile, suggesting I had erred. I denied it vehemently. “This roll is unexposed,” he pointed out. I left with a shred of dignity. It’s a humbling experience to realize one’s own foolishness. Yet no one savors that revelation. Suddenly, a model of the “Kenilworth Castle” caught my eye at the shipping office. An idea struck. I entered and inquired about the “Kilmorden Castle.” The ticket was exactly the amount of my inheritance. I opted for first class, sealing my fate on this adventure.",1
"Jack rushed to catch his train in Paris after a heated argument. Léonie, who witnessed his departure, couldn't understand the cause of the dispute due to the language barrier. Poirot decided to wait in the salon while I went to investigate Giraud's activities. As I made my way through the shrubbery, I unexpectedly collided with a young lady, who turned out to be Cinderella. She confessed to being intrigued by the murder at Villa Geneviève and begged me to show her the crime scene. Shocked by her morbid curiosity, I hesitated, unsure of what to do next.",1
"""Oh, what a beauty she is, cellela!” The elderly woman exclaimed with a hint of disdain. “Madame Daubreuil,” whispered the police commissioner in disbelief. “Inconceivable.” “Well, there you have it,” grumbled Françoise. “That's what happens when you speak the truth.” “Not necessarily,” the judge interjected calmly. “It was unexpected, that's all. So, Madame Daubreuil and Monsieur Renauld, they were...” he paused tactfully. “Ah? Was it truly them?” “Who's to say? But what can you do? Monsieur was a very wealthy English lord and Madame Daubreuil, despite her humble lifestyle, was quite elegant,” expressed the examining magistrate thoughtfully.",1
"“Detecting two gunshots fired,” he remarked, returning the weapon. “Now, madam, if I could inspect,” he delicately paused. “The maid will guide you,” she whispered, turning away. The parlourmaid led Poirot upstairs. I stayed behind with the elegant yet unfortunate woman. Unsure whether to speak, I attempted a few casual remarks to which she responded absentmindedly. After a brief moment, Poirot rejoined us. “Thank you for your cooperation, madam. I believe you need not worry further about this incident. By the way, are you familiar with your husband’s financial situation?” She shook her head.",1
"""The contents of her letter truly revealed her feelings of love, making any offer of money an insult. Eventually, he managed to dismiss her, and the choice of his words was telling."" ""'Please, leave now,' I urged. His words seemed forceful, but necessary."" ""He was eager for her to depart, not just due to the discomfort of the meeting. No, it was the ticking clock that mattered, time held significance for some unknown reason."" ""Why the rush?"" I inquired, puzzled. ""This is the question we ponder.""",1
"And then there was the coffee. It was very strong coffee.” “Well, what of it?” “Very strong,” repeated Poirot. “In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we get what?” “Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.” “Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.” “I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed. “You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll test his alibi?” “Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.” “You think he has an alibi?” “That is just what worries me. I have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point.” The Daily Newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events. Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed. Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up. Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless, I was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that that visitor was none other than Ascanio himself. “He wishes to consult you?” “Du tout, Hastings. I wish to consult him.” “What about?” “The Regent’s Court murder.” “You are going to prove that he did it?” “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to have the common sense. Ah, that is our friend’s ring.” A few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered in a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained standing, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us. “Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You in company with a friend visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th” The Italian made an angry gesture. “I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court” “Précisément and I have a little idea that you have sworn falsely.” “You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.” “Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do not like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little ideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your only chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came for the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.” “He was not a count,” growled the Italian. “I have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the Almanach de Gotha. Never mind, the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing.” “I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.” “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning that is so, is it not?” “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.” “Pardon, how was it paid?” “In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.” “Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?” “In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with the man.” “And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?” “I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.” Poirot looked at him and shook his head. “Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.” After bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me. “Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?” “Well, I suppose Ascanio is right somebody impersonated him.” “Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. Ça vous dit quelque chose? I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very strong. Count Foscatini’s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?” I shook my head, utterly bewildered. “Come, I will help you. What evidence have we that Ascanio and his friend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that night? Nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. We have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.” “You mean?” “I mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. Ah, but it was a clever idea! Graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a man of method! He overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning, enough to realize that Ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself. The following evening, about eight o’clock, he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone. Foscatini sits down, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind Graves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to the service telephone dinner for three! It comes, he lays the table, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to get rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a resolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos, the rice soufflé is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion. Ah, but it was magnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry. So successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from Flat II at that time.” “Except Hercule Poirot, I suppose?” I said sarcastically. “Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.” Poirot was right. He always is, confound him! The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the following day. She arrived punctually a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour. “My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,” she began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.” “If you please, mademoiselle.” “I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county. He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter. “Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these ‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted on that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’ “That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died. “I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death ‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.” “That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.” “I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.” “Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?” “No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.” “There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?” “I would not even attempt to do such a thing.” “You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle?” “That is exactly how I look upon it.” “It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.” “Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?” “Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.” “Have you the will or a copy of it with you?” Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it, nodding to himself. “Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also 11 a.m. that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for.",1
"""Imagine this scenario: he wakes up and catches a glimpse of me vanishing into the distance. Wouldn't he automatically assume that I was the one who attacked him? Especially since he already suspected me of following him?” “It’s a possibility,” I responded thoughtfully. “But it changes our entire perspective. And there are other factors to consider.” “Most of them have logical explanations. The individual who trailed you in Cape Town interacted with Pagett, who then checked his watch. Perhaps the man simply wanted to know the time.” “So, it was just a random occurrence?” “Not quite. There seems to be a calculated strategy at play here, linking Pagett to the whole incident.""",1
"He was a villain, but a pleasant one. Sir Eustace's escape was not surprising. Colonel Race knew his real name was Harry Lucas, but he was actually John Harold Eardsley. Harry deceived Anne, but eventually confessed the truth to her. Anne realized the discrepancies in his story and struggled with her feelings towards him. Harry wanted to live a simple life with Anne, away from his father's wealth. In the end, he revealed his true identity to Anne, feeling jealous of Colonel Race.",1
"The incident on the Underground, brushed off as mere chance, slipped from the public consciousness. But was it truly random? I harbored doubts. While the Tube mishap held a personal intrigue for me, there appeared to be a link between the two deaths. Both victims sported a sun-kissed complexion, indicating they were English expatriates, among other curious similarities. Intrigued by these peculiarities, I made a bold move. I marched into Scotland Yard, insisting on an audience with the lead investigator of the Mill House investigation.",1
"“Good Lord! You have a heart that is easily swayed!” “Hastings,” I said, “do you recall the aftermath of the Styles Case when ” “When you were entangled with feelings for two delightful women simultaneously, yet neither reciprocated? Yes, I recall.” “You comforted me by suggesting that one day we would collaborate on a case once more, and that then ” “And then?” “Here we are, collaborating again, and ” I hesitated, chuckling somewhat awkwardly. To my astonishment, Poirot vehemently shook his head. “Ah, my friend, do not become attached to Marthe Daubreuil.",1
"""So, based on your knowledge, he didn't have any enemies, and you have no idea about any secrets that might have led to his murder?"" ""That's correct."" ""M. Stonor, have you ever come across the name Duveen in relation to M. Renauld?"" ""Duveen. Duveen."" He pondered the name for a moment. ""I don't believe so. Although it does ring a bell."" ""Are you familiar with a woman, a friend of M. Renauld's named Bella?"" Once again, Mr. Stonor shook his head. ""Bella Duveen? Is that her full name? It's strange! I feel like I've heard it before. But I can't recall the context at the moment.""",1
"I sensed Harry's gaze before he even spoke. ""You resemble a witch, Anne,"" he finally uttered, his tone carrying an unfamiliar weight. His hand extended, barely brushing my hair, sending a shiver down my spine. Abruptly, he stood up with a curse. ""You need to depart by tomorrow, do you understand?"" he exclaimed. ""I can't endure this any longer. I am merely human. You have to go, Anne. It's imperative. You're no simpleton. Deep down, you realize this is unsustainable."" ""I guess not,"" I replied, deliberating each word.",1
"I avoided Carton carefully on board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under the pretence of illness. “I had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London. He went straight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day. He left the hotel shortly before one o’clock. I was behind him. He went straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying. It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House. I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton. I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner. He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films which I must have dropped somewhere later and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room God! It was horrible. Dead and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in. By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country. “I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.” “Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.” “He was supposed to be in Florence but he certainly never went there. I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved.”",1
"What was Poirot's true motive in searching for Bella Duveen? Was it related to the murder of Jack Renauld? The girl seemed to have no reason to wish for his death, but perhaps there was a deeper connection between them. Why did she keep returning to Merlinville? These questions circled in my mind as Poirot and I arrived in London, ready to uncover the truth. Time was of the essence, and Poirot was determined to act swiftly. Our next move was to seek out Joseph Aarons, a theatrical agent with connections that might lead us to the elusive Bella Duveen.",1
"We conducted a thorough assessment of the situation during our initial evening together. Our conversation lasted for hours. It was evident to me that a combination of defensive and aggressive strategies would be essential. I felt secure traveling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his group. With both him and Colonel Race by my side, I knew I had strong protection. I assumed my adversaries would be reluctant to provoke a confrontation. Furthermore, being close to Sir Eustace meant I was also connected to Guy Pagett, who was at the center of the enigma. I questioned Suzanne about the possibility of Pagett himself being the elusive “Colonel.""",1

Jack struggled with the idea of asking the girl who loved him to join him, but Poirot encouraged him to be honest and see what she would say. In the end, Jack found the courage to approach her as a man ready for a new beginning. As for Captain Hastings, he preferred to reminisce about a morning in the garden rather than join the Renaulds on their journey.",1
""" A dramatic gesture was made by her. “Undoubtedly, M. Stonor, the secretary, assisted her. They are closely connected, those two.

To begin, I have a question for you.""",1

Mrs. Havering, her employer, had hired her through Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street, but it turned out that no such woman had ever been registered with the agency. Poirot, the astute detective, quickly realized that Mrs. Middleton was just a clever disguise used by Mrs. Havering, an actress, to provide herself with an alibi during the murder of Mr. Harrington Pace. The truth unraveled as Poirot meticulously explained the sequence of events, revealing the hidden connections and deceptions that led to the crime.",1
"I waited for what felt like an eternity before I could finally feel the warmth returning to my hands. Rubbing my wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag that silenced me. Taking a few deep breaths, I managed to loosen the last knot, though it took some time before I could stand. Finally on my feet, I swung my arms to restore circulation, longing for a meal. After waiting to ensure my strength had returned, I silently made my way to the door. To my relief, it was only latched, not locked. I carefully unlatched it and peered out, making sure not to make a sound.",1
"""The concept of suicide is no longer a concern. However, if she manages to quiet Madame Renauld by force, escape using her silk ladder while we distract the further door, and return to Villa Marguerite before we do, it will be difficult to incriminate her. Hercule Poirot did not outsmart her, but rather she was outplayed by the petite acrobat with her strong wrists."" Reflecting on the situation, I questioned Poirot, ""When did you first suspect Marthe Daubreuil? Was it when she claimed to have overheard the argument in the garden?"" Poirot responded with a smile.",1
"I know what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still,” I began, and stopped. “Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella, yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my conscience horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be acquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he was not.… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son, who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily. So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear. We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Eh bien, speaking frankly in confidence, c’est entendu can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with empressement. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot. “It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows. They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my er experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “Pardon! But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “Toqué!” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “Toqué!” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting. Eh bien, once or twice, your manner has annoyed me.” “I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.” “He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “Dear M. Poirot: “If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn to, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees to help us. “MARTHE DAUBREUIL.” I handed it back, moved. “You will go?” “At once. We will command an auto.” Half an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the door to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of his. “Ah, you have come it is good of you. I have been in despair, not knowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even. I suffer horribly, I am nearly mad. Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down like that.” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he, but what do men care if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.” “Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, petite, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound. When he had finished, she drew a long breath. “But you are wonderful magnificent! You are the greatest detective in the world.” With a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French. “Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so.”",1
"“No,” Poirot declared with a firm shake of his head, “the culprit must be Dr. Ames.” The doctor gaped at him in disbelief, then echoed Dr. Tosswill’s words, exclaiming: “Someone is playing a trick on us. Let’s go, we’ll apprehend the perpetrator soon.” With determination, he sprinted after the elusive figure. I trailed behind, yet despite our thorough search, we discovered no signs of any individual passing through. Upon our return, Poirot was already busy implementing his unique methods to guarantee his own protection.",1
"“The rug by the fireplace is out of place,” he pointed out, pausing to adjust it. Suddenly, he straightened up with a gasp. Clutched in his hand was a tiny torn piece of paper. “Seems the French, much like the English, tend to neglect sweeping beneath the rugs!” Bex handed me the scrap, prompting me to take a closer look. “Does this ring a bell, Hastings?” I shook my head, feeling a sense of déjà vu with the pink hue of the paper. The inspector was quick to connect the dots. “A torn piece of a check,” he declared. The scrap was roughly two inches square, with the word “Duveen” inked onto it. “Good,” remarked Bex.",1
"He restrains and silences Madame Renauld, rectifying his error from two decades earlier, ensuring the tightness of the restraints this time to avoid implicating his partner. Despite this, he ensures she is equipped with the identical tale he fabricated previously, illustrating the mind's aversion to deviation. The evening air is cold, prompting him to don an additional coat over his garments, planning to discard it alongside the deceased in the burial site. Exiting through the window, he meticulously smooths the soil in the garden, inadvertently providing damning proof of his involvement.",1
"Poirot felt sympathy for the unfortunate lady, but his loyalty lay with the Insurance Company. As he prepared to depart, he whispered to Mrs. Maltravers: “Madame, you must understand, there are no true endings.” “What are you implying?” she asked, her gaze filled with fear. “Have you ever delved into the world of spiritualism? You possess a unique gift.” “I have been told as much. But surely you do not believe in such things?” “Madame, I have witnessed the inexplicable. Rumor has it that this house is plagued by spirits.” She nodded in agreement, just as the parlourmaid appeared to announce that dinner was served.",1
"I doubt she'll ever give me an explanation. No one ever does. I'm always left to figure it out on my own. It gets old pretty quick. I guess it's all part of the journalist game. “Navigating the rapids,” according to our Special Correspondent. After putting away the telegram, I politely excused myself from my Government contact. While I'm not thrilled about the idea of going hungry, I'm not concerned for my safety. Smuts is more than equipped to handle any uprising.",1
"I'll find the scoundrel and clear my name, or die trying. He tried to murder you cleverly, but I saw through his plan. Let me tell you the whole story, from the beginning. My real name is Harry Lucas and my father was a soldier in Rhodesia. Fate brought me to Young Eardsley, and together we found diamonds in British Guiana. Anita Grünberg came between us, a mystery we fell for. She betrayed us, and we lost everything. Now, I will seek justice for us both.",1
"“Hey, Bex!” he shouted. “Come take a look at this. There’s plenty of clues here for you.” The commissary approached and grinned. “Poirot, my friend, those footprints clearly belong to the gardener’s big hobnailed boots. And besides, it doesn’t matter much since there are no trees on this side, hence no way to access the upper floor.” “Fair point,” Poirot replied, looking disappointed. “So you believe these footprints are insignificant?” “Absolutely not.” To my surprise, Poirot then uttered: “I beg to differ with you.",1
"""And you were correct."" I gazed helplessly at Poirot, and he acknowledged my look. ""My dear Hastings is, as you Brits say, enjoying the seaside. Have a seat, and I will detail the entire case that has concluded so satisfactorily."" ""Concluded?"" ""Indeed. They have been apprehended."" ""Who has been apprehended?"" ""The chambermaid and the valet, of course! Did you not suspect? Especially after my mention of French chalk?"" ""You mentioned it was used by cabinet-makers."" ""Indeed, to help drawers slide smoothly. Someone wanted that drawer to move in silence. Who else but the chambermaid? The plan was so clever that it eluded even Hercule Poirot at first glance.""",1
"""The sea, oh the sea!"" he cried, his voice filled with lament. A week had passed since then, the golden sand of the desert beneath our feet. The blazing sun beat down relentlessly. Poirot, looking utterly miserable, withered by my side. Travel was not his forte, the four-day voyage from Marseilles had been pure torment for him. Upon landing in Alexandria, he was but a shadow of his former self, even his usual impeccable appearance had faded. Our destination was Cairo, and we immediately made our way to the Mena House Hotel, nestled in the shadow of the Pyramids. Egypt's allure captivated me, but Poirot remained unaffected.",1
"""Six months."" ""You sure it's her? The woman I saw was tall, fair, with reddish-gold hair."" ""That's her,"" confirmed the porter. ""They arrived in the Michaelmas quarter, precisely six months back."" He lost interest and walked away. I followed Poirot outside. ""Well, Hastings?"" my friend asked with a smirk. ""Still think charming women are always honest?"" I stayed silent. As we walked down Brompton Road, I finally asked Poirot about his plan and our destination.",1
"""The length of a clue, my friend, holds significance regardless of its size - a two-foot clue is just as crucial as one that measures two millimeters! It is a misconception that only tiny clues are important. As for the lead-piping, dismissing its relevance simply because Giraud said so is a mistake. Let us not discuss this further. Let Giraud continue his investigation, while I pursue my own thoughts. The case appears to be clear-cut, and yet, my friend, I am not convinced. Do you know why? It all comes back to the wristwatch that is two hours ahead. Additionally, there are a number of peculiar details that do not quite align.""",1
"""The man had gone off to fight in the war, showing courage and valor. He was declared missing, wounded, and presumed dead. I didn't press for further information, but I couldn't help but wonder about Colonel Race's involvement. To gather more insights, I decided to have a conversation with the night steward. After some persuasion, he revealed that the lady in question seemed unafraid, suggesting it was all part of a harmless prank or bet. Slowly but surely, I extracted all the details from him.""",1
"Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.” Black was straightforward enough over the matter. “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what” “What has it got to do with Mr.",1
"""She should have known better than to put it in writing, but I refrained from pointing that out. You carried out her instructions, visited the antique store, were led through the concealed passage from the rear chamber, and suddenly found yourself at the mercy of your foes!” Harry shot me a glance. I caught his meaning and subtly moved closer to Sir Eustace. “Indeed,” Sir Eustace murmured, “it seems luck is not on your side! Let me think, this marks, the third confrontation.” “You're correct,” Harry acknowledged. “This marks the third confrontation. Twice you have outsmarted me - have you not heard that luck changes on the third attempt? Now it's my turn - protect him, Anne.” I was prepared.""",1
"The precious Star of the East had vanished without a trace! ""This changes everything,"" I murmured. ""These were no ordinary criminals. They were after this one specific gem."" ""But how did the intruder gain entry?"" ""Through here."" ""But this door is always secured."" I disagreed. ""Not anymore. Look."" I swung it ajar while speaking. A piece of fabric drifted to the floor as I did so. I retrieved it. The silk was intricately embroidered, clearly ripped from a Chinese garment. ""It got caught in the door in his hurry,"" I deduced. ""Quick, let's go. He couldn't have gotten far."" Yet despite our efforts, our search yielded no results.",1
"I had leaped to my feet and was standing eye to eye with the stranger in the center of the room. There weren't many places to hide in that room for a man of his stature. I swiftly dragged out my heavy trunk, forcing him to crouch behind it and slip beneath the bed. I opened the lid of the trunk, all the while reaching for the wash-basin with my other hand. In one fluid motion, I twisted my hair into a tight bun on top of my head. It might not have been a sophisticated look, but it served its purpose. A woman, with her hair haphazardly tied up and reaching for a bar of soap to wash her neck, would never raise suspicion of aiding a fugitive.",1
"Despite the excruciating pain and my inability to shield my face, I struggled to maintain a specific course. I found myself spinning in all directions except the one I desired. Eventually, I reached my target, nearly brushing it with my tied hands. Yet, the task was far from simple. It required an eternity to maneuver the glass into a suitable position against the wall to rub against my restraints. The painstaking process nearly broke my spirit, but I persevered until I finally managed to cut through the ropes binding my wrists.",1
"I collected all the necessary information from Mrs. Havering and we quickly discovered that the mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton, had connections to the crime. She seemed to have disappeared after the murder. It was evident that she had played a crucial role in providing an alibi for Mrs. Havering during the time of the crime. The murderer had arrived and escaped in a car, which also brought Mrs. Middleton to her new position. The revolver found at Ealing was a diversion tactic, and the true culprits managed to evade justice. It was a complex and well-executed plan, leaving us no choice but to accept the hand of Fate in this matter.",1
"” Upon arriving at our hotel, he signaled for silence and we proceeded to have lunch with great appetite. It was clear to me that Poirot preferred not to discuss the recent tragedy in a public setting. Despite this, the topic weighed heavily on my mind, leaving no room for other conversation. We sat in silence for some time until Poirot slyly remarked, “Well! What about your little slip-ups? Care to share?” My face grew warm as I tried to downplay the morning's events with casual indifference.”",1
"It remains uncertain how long the girl has been in that place, but it is quite evident that she is not Anne. There is a certain level of discretion when it comes to meddling in the affairs of others. If I were in his shoes, I would not hesitate to remove Race from the island if he dared to pry into my personal matters. The decision has been made, I will depart for Jo'burg tomorrow. Race is adamant that I do so. The situation there is deteriorating, according to reports, so it is best to leave before it escalates further. I am prepared to face the possibility of being shot by a striker. Initially, Mrs. Blair was supposed to accompany me, yet she had a change of heart at the last moment and opted to remain at the Falls.",1
"Poirot carefully surveyed the room, running his hand over the furniture and inspecting the cleanliness with approval. Suddenly, he straightened a crooked hearth-rug and discovered a small piece of paper hidden beneath it. Upon closer examination, it was revealed to be a torn fragment of a cheque, signed by M. Renauld to someone named Duveen. The commissary, flustered by his oversight, quickly turned to Madame Renauld for answers. With a renewed sense of determination, they left the room, leaving behind the mystery of the unexpected guest from the night before.",1
"His corpse was discovered in the shed adjacent to the crime scene, having succumbed at least two days prior. It is highly likely that he suffered a stabbing wound akin to M. Renauld, although not necessarily to the rear."" I was taken aback and taken aback I was. Throughout my experience with Poirot, he had never executed something as astonishing as this. And, almost inevitably, a suspicion crept into my thoughts. ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""you're teasing me. You must have already been informed."" He fixed his sincere gaze on me disapprovingly. ""Would I stoop to such deceit? I can assure you that I am completely uninformed.""",1
"""The work can wait,"" he stated firmly. Suddenly, his attention shifted to the issue of an additional cabin. ""There's no space for work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It's overflowing with trunks,"" he exclaimed. His disdain for the trunks was palpable, as if they were unwanted pests. I tried to lighten the mood by reminding him of the necessity of packing extra clothing when traveling. He responded with his usual weak smile, brushing off my attempt at humor and returning to the task at hand.",1
"“But what is it about him that draws you in? I fail to see any appeal in him, aside from his daring good looks and his modern-day caveman approach to love.” I vented my frustration towards Suzanne for a few moments. “Just because you’re happily married and letting yourself go, you seem to have forgotten about the existence of romance,” I concluded. “Oh, I’m not letting myself go, Anne. The stress of worrying about you lately must have taken a toll on me.” “You appear to be in good shape,” I remarked coolly. “I’d venture to guess you’ve gained at least five pounds.”",1
"""Youth calls to youth, but my work still beckons,"" I said quietly. It felt impossible to love two men simultaneously, yet the allure of this man was undeniable. Looking into his eyes, I whispered, ""Your future is destined for greatness. You will leave a mark on the world."" It was as if I was foreseeing his path. ""I will be alone,"" he mused. ""That's the price of greatness,"" I assured him. With a gentle grasp of my hand, he confessed, ""I wish it was the other way."" Just then, Harry appeared from around the house, interrupting our moment.",1
"""I truly believe so.” “They might have eloped,” I said, trying to calm the situation, even though I knew it was a foolish suggestion. But in a place like this, where would they go? I kept rambling, unsure of how much longer I could keep it up, until Race suddenly entered the room. I had been somewhat correct - he had been out for a walk, but Anne was not with him. My approach to the situation was completely off. Race quickly had the entire hotel in chaos within minutes.",1
"""Given the circumstances, I decided to postpone my trip. But when I read the distressing news in the newspaper, I rushed to offer my assistance. Perhaps you could use some help in managing things for a while."" Just then, they noticed our presence. Poirot took a step forward and, after apologizing profusely, mentioned that he had left his cane in the hallway. Somewhat reluctantly, it appeared to me, Mrs. Maltravers performed the necessary introductions. ""Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black."" A brief conversation followed, during which Poirot discovered that Captain Black was staying at the Anchor Inn.",1
"” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well. I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did not know how intensely respectable he is I should suspect him of some disreputable amou. I wonder now! Even the most respectable menIt would cheer me up enormously if it was so. Pagett with a guilty secret! Splendid! It has been a curious evening. The only costume that fitted me in the barber’s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear. I don’t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter’s evening in England but it’s hardly an ideal costume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business from both sides. Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair, who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably. Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me. A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but at last they managed it, and a start was made. The mules raced along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.” This, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come from my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious. “My God!” he said anxiously.",1
"Did her smile vanish, her heart gripped by nameless fear? Or did she ascend the stairs, still smiling, unaware of the impending doom? My heart quickened. Was the house truly deserted? Was doom lurking for me as well? For the first time, I grasped the significance of the oft-used term, ""atmosphere."" There was a sense in this house, a sense of malice, of threat, of malevolence. Pushing aside the oppressive emotions, I ascended the stairs swiftly. Finding the room of the tragedy posed no challenge. On the day the body was found, a heavy rain had fallen, leaving behind large muddy footprints on the bare floor in all directions.",1
"""It's a beautiful and consoling thought, isn't it? You can go now, but be cautious. Ah, he's left! My friend Hastings stares at me with reproachful eyes. It was all so simple! It was evident right from the start that out of the numerous applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions, only the Robinsons were deemed appropriate. Why? What was it that made them stand out from the others almost immediately? Their appearance? Maybe, but it wasn't that unique. Their name, then!"" ""But the name Robinson is quite common,"" I exclaimed.",1
"""You're a woman."" ""Your idea of a woman is someone who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That's all prehistoric. But you will show me around, won't you? You see, it might make a big difference to me."" ""In what way?"" ""They're keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don't know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff."" I hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine. ""Please, there's a dear."" I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably, he regarded her as vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet anyone. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud, ""in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs."" I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again. Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon. From within came the murmur of voices. ""Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise."" ""No,"" I said hastily, ""I don't want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations."" ""But certainly, monsieur."" He produced it. ""Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all."" ""Of course."" I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud's eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. ""You've got it then?"" ""Of course,"" I said coolly. ""All the same, you know, what I'm doing is highly irregular."" ""You've been a perfect duck, and I shan't forget it. Come along. They can't see us from the house, can they?"" ""Wait a minute."" I arrested her eager advance. ""I won't stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You've seen the grave, and the grounds, and you've heard all the details of the affair. Isn't that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant."" She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. ""Me for the horrors,"" she said. ""Come along."" In silence, we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl's lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. ""You see,"" I said, ""he was stabbed in the back."" Her voice was almost soundless. ""With what?"" I nodded towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. ""You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you."" ""Water,"" she murmured. ""Quick. Water...."" I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately, none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes, I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvelous manner. ""Take me out of here oh, quickly, quickly!"" she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm, I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. ""That's better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?"" I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile. Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all, she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. ""I did my best to stop you, you know,"" I said gently. ""I suppose you did. Well, good-bye."" ""Look here, you can't start off like that all alone. You're not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville."" ""Nonsense. I'm quite all right now."" ""Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you."" But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour onto the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. ""Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me."" ""Are you sure you're all right now?"" ""Quite, thanks. I hope you won't get into any trouble over showing me things?"" I disclaimed the idea lightly. ""Well, good-bye."" ""Au revoir,"" I corrected. ""If you're staying here, we shall meet again."" She flashed a smile at me. ""That's so. Au revoir, then."" ""Wait a second, you haven't told me your address?"" ""Oh, I'm staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It's a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow."" ""I will,"" I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary empressement. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed. Fortunately, no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the sergent de ville. And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon, I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed. Was it locked? Of course, it was locked. Where was the key kept? Parbleu, it was in the door, of course! There was nothing of value to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of assassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse's time. M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man withdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot's unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. ""Pardon M. Hautet,"" I cried, ""but will you permit me to ask him one question?"" ""But certainly, monsieur."" Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. ""Where do you keep your boots?"" ""Sac à papier!"" growled the old man. ""On my feet. Where else?"" ""But when you go to bed at night?"" ""Under my bed."" ""But who cleans them?"" ""Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise!"" he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. ""Well, well,"" said the magistrate. ""We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has anyone seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and "" ""You will not have to send far, M. le juge."" The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window. He leaped lightly into the room and advanced to the table. ""Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner."" ""Not at all. Not at all,"" said the magistrate, rather confused. ""Of course, I am only a detective,"" continued the other. ""I know nothing of interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do so without an open window. Anyone standing outside can so easily hear all that passes. But no matter."" M. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously, the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offense. ""Eh bien, M. Giraud,"" said the magistrate rather sharply. ""Without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names of the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where they find themselves now?"" Unmoved by this irony, Giraud replied: ""I know at least where they have come from."" ""Comment?"" Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded around. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. ""What do you see there?"" he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. ""A cigarette end, and a match."" ""And what does that tell you?"" Poirot spread out his hands. ""It tells me nothing."" ""Ah!"" said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. ""You haven't made a study of these things. That's not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It's common enough in South America. Luckily it's unlighted. I mightn't have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so."" ""And the other match?"" asked Poirot. ""Which match?"" ""The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?"" ""No."" ""Perhaps you didn't search very thoroughly."" ""Not search thoroughly "" For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. ""I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper."" Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: ""The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America."" ""No,"" replied the other confidently. ""I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different."" ""You do not think it odd,"" asked Poirot, ""that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?"" Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. ""Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable."" ""Aha!"" said M. Hautet. ""An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!"" ""Or outside it,"" said Giraud with a peculiar smile. ""But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?"" ""D'accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key."" ""But who did possess a key?"" Giraud shrugged his shoulders. ""As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping."" ""Who is that?"" ""Madame Daubreuil,"" said the detective dryly. ""Eh, eh!"" said the magistrate, his face falling a little, ""so you have heard about that, have you?"" ""I hear everything,"" said Giraud imperturbably. ""There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,"" said M. Hautet, delighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado, he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He also touched on the check made out to ""Duveen,"" and finally handed Giraud the letter signed ""Bella."" Giraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then handed it back. ""All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected."" ""And your theory is?"" ""For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations."" ""Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,"" said Poirot suddenly. ""Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once."" ""Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you."" Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: ""I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain."" We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment.",1
"“That’s what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen.” That finished Graves’s story. He had gone out about 8.30, and, meeting a friend, had accompanied him to the Metropolitan Music Hall in Edgware Road. Nobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at 8.47. A small clock on the writing-table had been swept off by Foscatini’s arm, and had stopped at that hour, which agreed with Miss Rider’s telephone summons. The police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it was now lying on the couch. I saw the face for the first time the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face. “Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any chance?” As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.” The inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us with a grin. “Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. It’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these Italian vendetta things, as likely as not.” Thus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was full of excitement. “Like the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn’t believe it if you read about it.” Poirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he had hardly opened his lips. “What says the master detective, eh?” asked Hawker, clapping him on the back. “Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.” “You think not?” “What could there be?” “Well, for example, there is the window.” “The window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in that way. I noticed it specially.” “And why were you able to notice it?” The doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain. “It is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd, that. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.” “Well, what of it?” “Very black,” repeated Poirot. “In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we get what?” “Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.” “Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.” “I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed. “You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll test his alibi?” “Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.” “You think he has an alibi?” “That is just what worries me. I have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point.” The Daily Newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events. Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed. Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up. Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless, I was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that that visitor was none other than Ascanio himself. “He wishes to consult you?” “Du tout, Hastings. I wish to consult him.” “What about?” “The Regent’s Court murder.” “You are going to prove that he did it?” “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to have the common sense. Ah, that is our friend’s ring.” A few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered in a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained standing, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us. “Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You in company with a friend visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th” The Italian made an angry gesture. “I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court” “Précisément and I have a little idea that you have sworn falsely.” “You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.” “Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do not like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little ideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your only chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came for the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.” “He was not a count,” growled the Italian. “I have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the Almanach de Gotha. Never mind, the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing.” “I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.” “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning that is so, is it not?” “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need.",1
"""Listen to the Professor's daughter,"" Suzanne interjected as I presented my argument. ""It may be true. However, Pagett could be seen as the Grand Vizier, in a sense, of the All Highest."" I paused for a moment, deep in thought. ""I wonder how Sir Eustace accumulated his wealth."" ""Are you suspecting him once more?"" ""Suzanne, I've reached a point where suspicion comes naturally! I'm not truly suspecting him, but he is Pagett's boss, and he was the previous owner of the Mill House.""",1
"Renauld will fly to Paris, where he will lie low until the time comes for him to join his wife in a foreign country under assumed names. They have planned it all meticulously, down to the smallest detail. But fate has other ideas. The tramp's death sets off a chain of events that they could never have predicted. And now, as Poirot unravels the truth, the shocking reality of their carefully laid plans comes to light. Will justice be served, or will their cunning scheme succeed in the end? Only time will tell.",1
"Lord Estair was visibly shaken as he entered Poirot's office. ""I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy,"" he said. Poirot assured him, ""You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!"" Lord Estair then revealed the shocking news - the Prime Minister had been kidnapped just before the crucial Allied Conference. As Poirot delved deeper into the details, it became clear that time was of the essence. The race was on to rescue the Prime Minister before the conference began the following evening. The situation was dire, the stakes were high, and Poirot knew that failure was not an option.",1
"I didn't waste any time considering Anne's potential motives for her deceptive remarks. Instead, I relished the opportunity to outsmart Race, who was overly self-assured. Pulling the telegram from my pocket, I presented it to him. ""Care to explain this?"" I inquired casually. His reaction was one of utter shock. ""She claimed she was just setting out for Beira,"" he mumbled, clearly perplexed. Despite Race's reputation for intelligence, I found him to be rather dense. He seemed incapable of grasping the fact that women don't always tell the truth. ""And Kimberley as well. What could they possibly be up to there?"" he grumbled.",1
"“Excuse me, if it’s already spoken for.” “Oh, I apologize, ma'am. I've been bothered quite a bit by those journalists. Can't catch a break. No, the house isn't rented and probably won't be now.” “Are the pipes faulty?” I questioned quietly. “Goodness, no, ma'am, the pipes are fine! But surely you've heard about that foreign woman who was murdered here?” “I think I remember reading something about it in the news,” I replied casually. My lack of concern intrigued the kind lady. Had I shown any curiosity, she likely would have clammed up.",1
"I could sense the hopelessness in Poirot's gaze. Together, we pushed against the door with all our strength. From the window, Cinderella's voice pierced through the tension, cool and detached: ""You'll never make it in time. I suppose it's up to me."" Before I could react, she seemed to launch herself into the void. I scrambled to the window and peered out. My heart stopped as I witnessed her hanging from the rooftop, inching her way towards the illuminated window. ""Dear God! She's risking her life,"" I exclaimed. ""Don't forget, Hastings. She's a seasoned acrobat.""",1
"""He hesitated. ""So you're saying,"" she murmured quietly, ""the confirmation of my husband's body?"" The judge inclined his head. ""I am a resilient woman, sir. I can handle whatever is asked of me. I am prepared now."" ""Oh, tomorrow will suffice, I promise you."" ""I would rather face it now,"" she uttered softly, a look of anguish briefly crossing her features. ""If you wouldn't mind offering me your arm, Doctor?"" The physician stepped forward, a cloak draped over Mrs. Renauld's shoulders, and a solemn procession descended the stairs. Mr. Bex rushed ahead to unlock the shed's door.""",1
"""I've kept quiet for years, knowing I had this weapon in reserve. But now things have changed. I want my price, and it won't come cheap. It's quite a staggering amount,"" she declared. ""Incredible,"" the Count remarked. ""Do you really carry these diamonds with you at all times?"" His gaze swept across the messy room. Nadina chuckled softly. ""Don't assume anything. I'm not that foolish. The diamonds are hidden in a secure location where no one would think to look for them.""",1
"I encountered a short, slender individual sporting facial hair, fixating his gaze upon me with intense scrutiny as if I were a specter. His intense emotions piqued my interest, prompting me to investigate further. After some inquiries at the inn, I discovered his identity as Carton, hailing from Kimberley, working as a diamond-sorter for De Beers. The familiar feeling of injustice resurfaced within me, leading me to depart for Kimberley. Despite my efforts, information on him remained scarce. Determined to confront him, I armed myself with a revolver for the impending meeting.",1
"“No, I promised myself that I would care for you better than anyone else could. No one ever visits this secluded island. I convinced old Batani, who I once helped recover from a fever, to come and take care of you. She is trustworthy and will never betray us. I could hide you here for months and no one would suspect a thing.” The thought of those words brought me satisfaction. “You made the right decision,” I assured calmly. “I won’t reach out to anyone. A few more days of uncertainty won’t change much. After all, they are not my own kin.”",1
"A nervous wreck, poor thing. I've done what I could to shield her, but the shock was inevitable."" ""You were treating Mr. Maltravers recently?"" ""My dear sir, I never treated him."" ""What?"" ""I believe Mr. Maltravers followed Christian Science or a similar belief."" ""But you conducted the examination?"" ""Indeed. I was summoned by a gardener."" ""And the cause of death was evident?"" ""Undoubtedly. Blood on the lips, but the majority of bleeding internally."" ""Was the body left undisturbed?"" ""Yes, untouched from where it was discovered.""",1
"I was vehemently against the idea of educating women. My belief was that females should focus on household chores and manual labor, rather than wasting time on academic pursuits. This viewpoint clashed with the upbringing my uncle intended for me, causing me great frustration and anger. Despite his insistence, I refused to comply. I was well aware of my intellectual capabilities and had no interest in menial tasks. Our relationship was strained by our opposing views, leading to numerous heated debates. Although we cared for each other deeply, our stubbornness was a constant source of conflict.",1
"“Renauld? Someone who was lurking near the Villa just before midnight that evening, someone who stood to gain from his demise – the shoe seems to fit Jack Renauld all too perfectly. The murder may not have been planned in advance. Ah, but then there’s the matter of the dagger!” My attention was suddenly piqued; I had overlooked this detail. “Indeed,” I mused. “The additional dagger discovered on the vagabond belonged to Mrs. Renauld. Two daggers in play, it seems.” “Indeed, and given that they were identical, it follows that Jack Renauld possessed the other. However, that aspect does not overly concern me. In fact, I have a notion or two regarding that.”",1
"As the time approached for my departure, a sense of melancholy overcame me. Would he release me without a word or gesture? His brooding silences and sudden outbursts of restlessness kept me on edge. The breaking point arrived one evening as we sat outside the hut, the setting sun casting long shadows. My hair, lacking the confinement of hairpins, cascaded down my back in a dark, straight curtain. Lost in my thoughts, I pondered my next move.",1
"""I stood outside waiting, but they never emerged. Eventually, I ventured inside. Sir Eustace, the shop was deserted! There must be an alternate exit,"" I informed him. ""Upon my return to the hotel, I inquired about Miss Pettigrew."" Pagett leaned in, his voice hushed and breath heavy with the weight of confidentiality. ""Sir Eustace, a witness saw a man exiting her room last night."" Arching my eyebrows, I commented, ""And I had always believed her to be a woman of impeccable reputation."" Ignoring my remark, Pagett continued, ""I proceeded directly to her room and conducted a thorough search.""",1
"But this is a darkness deep. I cannot see.” “Well, Poirot,” I exclaimed impatiently, as the Ministers exited, “what is your assessment?” My companion was occupied packing a tiny bag, with swift, adept movements. He pondered, shaking his head. “I am at a loss. My mind eludes me.” “Why, instead of abducting him, not simply incapacitate him with a blow to the head?” I pondered. “Excuse me, mon ami, but I did not quite suggest that. Undoubtedly, it is much more their responsibility to abduct him.” “But why?” “Because uncertainty breeds panic. That is one reason. If the Prime Minister were deceased, it would be a grave disaster, but it would be dealt with. However, now there is indecision. Will the Prime Minister resurface, or not? Is he alive or dead? No one knows, and until they do, nothing concrete can be accomplished. And, as I mentioned, uncertainty fosters panic, which is the goal of les Boches. Moreover, if the abductors are holding him in secret, they have the advantage of being able to negotiate with both sides. The German Government is not known for its generosity, but they may be persuaded to provide substantial payments in such a case. Thirdly, they avoid the risk of execution. Indeed, kidnapping is clearly their responsibility.” “Then, if that is the case, why did they attempt to shoot him first?” Poirot expressed frustration. “Ah, that is what baffles me! It is nonsensically foolish! They had everything arranged (and very well arranged!) for the abduction, yet they jeopardize the entire plan with a melodramatic assault, reminiscent of a movie, and equally unrealistic. It is almost unbelievable, with a group of masked individuals not far from London!” “Perhaps they were two entirely separate attempts occurring without regard to one another,” I suggested. “Ah, no, that would be too coincidental! Then, who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor in the initial incident, at any rate. But was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of them, or why did the car veer off the main road? We cannot assume that the Prime Minister was complicit in his own demise! Did O’Murphy take that detour of his own volition, or was it at Daniels’ behest?” “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.” “Yes, because if it had been Daniels’, the Prime Minister would have heard the command and inquired about the rationale. But there are far too many unanswered questions in this case, and they contradict each other. If O’Murphy is honest, why did he deviate from the main road? But if he was deceitful, why did he restart the vehicle after only two shots were fired, potentially saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, if he was truthful, why did he immediately drive to a known haunt of German spies upon leaving Charing Cross?” “It appears suspicious,” I remarked. “Let us analyze the situation methodically. What evidence is there for and against these two men? Let us start with O’Murphy. Against: his actions in leaving the main road were dubious; he hails from County Clare; he has vanished in a suggestive manner. In favor: his quick response in resuming driving saved the Premier’s life; he is a Scotland Yard officer, and evidently, based on his assigned role, a trusted detective. Now, regarding Daniels. There is little against him, except that his background is unknown, and he speaks numerous languages for an Englishman! (Forgive me, mon ami, but your linguistic skills are lacking!) As for him, we have the fact that he was discovered bound, gagged, and chloroformed, which suggests he was not involved.” “He could have bound and gagged himself to divert suspicion.” Poirot shook his head. “The French authorities would not overlook such a detail. Furthermore, once he had achieved his goal, and the Prime Minister had been safely abducted, there would be no reason for him to stay behind. His accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see their motive. He is of little value to them now, since he is bound to be under close scrutiny until the Prime Minister’s situation is clarified.” “Maybe he intended to mislead the police?” “Then why didn’t he? He claims that something was placed over his nose and mouth, and he recalls nothing beyond that. There is no diversion there. It sounds remarkably truthful.” “Well,” I said, checking the time, “I suppose we should head to the station. You might uncover more clues in France.” “Possibly, mon ami, but I am skeptical. I find it hard to believe that the Prime Minister remains undiscovered in that confined area, where concealing him must be arduous. If the military and police forces of two nations have not located him, how could I?” At Charing Cross, we were greeted by Mr. Dodge. “This is Detective Barnes from Scotland Yard and Major Norman. They are at your service. Best of luck. It’s a dire situation, but I have not lost hope. I must go now.” And the Minister departed swiftly. We engaged in casual conversation with Major Norman. In the midst of the group of men on the platform, I spotted a small, sharp-faced man conversing with a tall, blond individual. He was an old acquaintance of Poirot’s Detective-Inspector Japp, reputed to be one of Scotland Yard’s most astute officers. He approached my friend jovially. “I heard you were involved in this case as well. Impressive work. So far, they have eluded capture. But I am confident they cannot keep him hidden for long. Our teams are meticulously searching France. I sense it is only a matter of time now.” “That is, if he is still breathing,” the tall detective remarked gloomily. Japp’s expression fell. “Yes.",1
"“And yet,” whispered the magistrate, “it seemed so promising at the start, such a simple and beautiful case.” His eyes briefly met Mrs. Renauld's, causing a sudden blush to spread across his face. “Ah, indeed,” he cleared his throat, shuffling through the documents scattered on the desk. “Now, where were we? Ah, yes, the murder weapon. I'm afraid this may be difficult for you, M. Renauld. I believe it was a gift from you to your mother. Quite tragic, very distressing.” Jack Renauld leaned in closer, his complexion turning from flushed to a ghostly pallor. “Are you suggesting that my father was killed with a mere aeroplane wire paper cutter? It can't be! Such a trivial object!” “Unfortunately, M.",1
"""Flushed cheeks and an unmoved Poirot. A cigarette end and a match, but what does it tell you? Giraud satisfied with South American match. Poirot jokes about thorough searching.

"""Really?"" ""Did you not hear the news?"" ""What news?"" ""There was another murder last night!"" ""What?"" Abandoning my breakfast, I grabbed my hat and sprinted towards the scene. Another murder and Poirot was not around! What bad luck. But who was the victim? I burst through the gate. A cluster of servants stood in the driveway, chatting and gesturing. I grabbed Françoise. ""What's going on?"" ""Oh, sir! Another death! It's awful. There's a curse on this place. Yes, I'm saying it, a curse! They need to call for the priest to bring some holy water. I'll never spend another night under this roof. It could be me next, who knows?"" She made the sign of the cross.",1
"“Darling,” declared Sir Eustace, “Your duty is to hold my hand immediately.” Miss Pettigrew cleared her throat, causing Sir Eustace to retract his hand hastily. “Ah, yes,” he continued. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, during his speech atWhat’s causing the delay? Why aren’t you jotting it down?” “I believe,” remarked Colonel Race softly, “that Miss Pettigrew’s pencil has snapped.” Taking it from her, he proceeded to sharpen it. Sir Eustace and I exchanged puzzled looks. There was an underlying tone in Colonel Race’s voice that left me unsettled. (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) I am contemplating abandoning my Reminiscences. Instead, I shall compose a brief piece titled “Assistants I have encountered.” When it comes to assistants, it appears I am cursed. At one moment, I have none, at another, I am overwhelmed with them. Currently, I find myself traveling to Rhodesia in the company of several women. Naturally, Race has absconded with the most attractive pair, leaving me with the less desirable one. This seems to be a recurring pattern for me, especially considering this is my private car, not Race’s. Anne Beddingfeld is also accompanying me to Rhodesia under the guise of being my temporary assistant. However, she has spent the entire afternoon on the observation platform with Race, marveling at the Hex River Pass. Although I informed her that her main task would be to hold my hand, she hasn’t even attempted to do so. Perhaps she is intimidated by Miss Pettigrew. I can’t say I blame her if that’s the case. Miss Pettigrew is not a pleasant sight, resembling more of a man than a woman with her large feet. Anne Beddingfeld remains an enigma. She boarded the train at the last minute, out of breath as though she had been racing to catch it, despite Pagett informing me that he had seen her off to Durban the previous night! Either Pagett is mistaken or the girl possesses some supernatural ability. And she never provides any explanation. Yes, “Assistants I have encountered.” No. 1, a fugitive murderer. No. 2, a secretive drinker entangled in scandalous affairs in Italy. No. 3, a stunning woman capable of being in two places simultaneously. No. 4, Miss Pettigrew, who I suspect is actually a dangerous criminal in disguise! Perhaps one of Pagett’s associates from Italy that he has foisted upon me. I wouldn’t be surprised if the world one day discovers that Pagett has been deceiving us all. All things considered, I believe Rayburn was the most tolerable. He never caused me any trouble or obstructed me in any way. Guy Pagett has had the audacity to have the stationery trunk placed in here. It obstructs our movements at every turn. When I ventured out onto the observation platform earlier, I anticipated a warm reception. Instead, both women were captivated by one of Race’s tales of his travels. I might as well rename this car “Colonel Race and his Entourage” instead of “Sir Eustace Pedler and Party.” Then Mrs.",1
"""I chose to hire Harry as my secretary instead of turning him in to the authorities,"" she explained. ""I was after those accursed diamonds. Nadina, that sneaky little vixen, was pitting your Harry against me. If I didn't meet her demands, she threatened to sell the gems back to him. It was a miscalculation on my part. I assumed she would have them on her that day, but she was more cunning than I anticipated. To make matters worse, her husband Carton was also deceased, leaving me clueless as to the whereabouts of the diamonds.""",1
"""He retreated and I was left to process this piece of information. Who was the mysterious woman who visited my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My expression darkened as I grasped the cleverness and boldness of my unidentified enemies. Gathering my thoughts, I exited my cabin and headed towards Mrs. Blair's. I rapped on the door. “Who is it?” her voice called out from inside. “It's Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I stepped inside. Various articles of clothing were strewn about, and Mrs. Blair was adorned in a stunning kimono. The colors of orange, gold, and black in the garment made my mouth water as I admired it.""",1
"""Japp noted, 'Turned away for a moment, and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.' I inquired about his thoughts on the case as we exited the gruesome chamber. 'Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!' he said, acknowledging my astonishment. 'Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past.'""",1
"I never expected to find myself in such a situation. As a crime novelist, I had always imagined myself writing about thrilling events, not actually experiencing them. But here I was, faced with a wounded man in my cabin on the Kilmorden Castle. The night had taken a turn I had never anticipated. It all started with a number - 17. Little did I know that this seemingly innocuous number would lead me down a path of danger and intrigue. The man before me, wounded and defiant, was a puzzle waiting to be solved. And I, with my histrionic talents and quick thinking, was determined to unravel the mystery that lay before me. It was a night I would never forget, a night that would forever change the course of my life.",1
"As I looked around, a sense of malevolence hung in the air. The chilling possibility crossed my mind - could I be the next target? Poirot whispered softly, ""Mon Dieu, this is beyond comprehension. It's terrifying. Please, sir, was it definitely tetanus?"" ""I don't think so. Dr. Ames will have more information,"" I replied. ""Ah, you're not the physician then."" ""No, I'm Tosswill."" Lady Willard's British specialist, a man named Tosswill from the British Museum, emitted an aura of seriousness and determination that intrigued me. ""Follow me,"" Dr. Ames urged.",1
"“You need me to look into his death?” “I need you to find out how much of the news is just gossip, and how much is actually true? Three deaths, Monsieur Poirot each one seemingly explainable on its own, but together such an incredible coincidence, all within a month of the tomb being opened! It might just be superstition, or perhaps a curse from the past that works in mysterious ways. Nevertheless, three deaths! And I am scared, Monsieur Poirot, very scared. This might not be over yet.” “Who are you worried about?” “My son.”",1
"""But I didn’t like it. I wanted to do the thing on my own. “That’s settled,” said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching herself with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted with my own eloquence. Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.” “Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted. It was after midnight. I leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam. Ahead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark water. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange peace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream. And suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger. I had heard nothing, but I swung round instinctively. A shadowy form had crept up behind me. As I turned, it sprang. One hand gripped my throat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately, but I had no chance. I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling. My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship. There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending over him. “Did you hit him again?” I called breathlessly. “There was no need,” he replied grimly. “I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands. Rayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation. The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr. er Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely. “Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once I offer it again. Will you have it?” The fierceness of his answer took me aback. “No. I’ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise. “Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in my power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press ever so little. “Like this and squeeze the life out of you! And then like our unconscious friend here, but with more success fling your dead body to the sharks. What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real.""",1
"I was always the professional in this business, starting as a youngster with a knack for devising clever schemes. I never made the mistake of carrying them out myself - always employing experts. But Nadina was an exception. She knew too much. My downfall was trusting her. Now, reflecting on my failures, I realize where I went wrong. That imbecile Pagett was a pawn in my game, with his poisoner's face and old-fashioned ways. My sense of humor led me to keep him around, even though I knew it was unwise. But I digress. The focus now is on you. Where are the diamonds? Do you trust Harry Rayburn with them?""",1
"“The victim predicted his own demise? That certainly complicates things! But please, step inside.” He gestured towards the open gate, leading the way towards the house. As we walked, M. Bex filled us in: “The investigating magistrate, M. Hautet, needs to be informed immediately. He just wrapped up his examination of the crime scene and is preparing for the interrogations. A delightful man. You'll find him quite personable. Unconventional in his approach, but a fair arbiter.” Poirot inquired, “Do we know the time of death?” “The body was found this morning around nine o’clock. Testimonies from Madame Renauld and the medical experts suggest that the fatal incident likely took place around 2 a.",1
"I pondered whether the killer had left any footprints the day before. The authorities would probably not divulge this information, but I doubted it. The climate had been pleasant and arid. The space itself was unremarkable. A nearly square shape with two large bay windows, simple white walls, and a bare wooden floor, the perimeter of which was marked by the absence of a carpet. I meticulously examined the area, yet there was not even a single object left behind. The brilliant young investigator appeared unlikely to stumble upon an overlooked piece of evidence.",1
"""Miss Marsh, do you have the will or a copy of it on hand?"" Poirot asked, accepting the document she handed him. After a quick review, he noted, ""This was made three years ago, on March 25 at 11 a.m. The timing is quite telling and limits our search. We must now look for another will. Even a will made just half-an-hour later would change everything. Well, mademoiselle, you have brought me a charming and clever problem to solve. I look forward to unraveling it for you.""",1
"“Maybe he’s the one against him. My theory continues. Rayburn, also known as the ‘Man in the Brown Suit,’ was found with a paper he had read. Deceived by a dot, he heads to Cabin 17 on the 22nd at one o’clock, after failing to acquire the cabin from Pagett. On his way, he is attacked and knifed.” “By who?” I asked. “Chichester. It all fits. Once you inform Lord Nasby that you’ve discovered ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ your fate is sealed, Anne!” “You’re missing a few things.” “What things? Rayburn has a scar, yes, but it could be fake. He matches the height and build. Remember the description of the suspect at Scotland Yard?” I shivered. Suzanne was perceptive and intelligent, but I hoped she wasn’t familiar with anthropological terms. “Dolichocephalic,” I casually replied. Suzanne seemed uncertain. “Is that correct?” “Yes. It means long-headed, a head where its width is less than 75 percent of its length,” I explained confidently. There was a pause, and just as I relaxed, Suzanne questioned, “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean, the opposite?” “There must be one. What’s the term for heads with a width greater than 75 percent of their length?” “Brachycephalic,” I reluctantly murmured. “That’s right. I thought that’s what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I asserted. Suzanne scrutinized me, then chuckled. “You’re a good liar, Gipsy girl. But tell me everything now, it’ll save time.” “There’s nothing to tell,” I confessed reluctantly. “Really?” Suzanne prodded gently. “I guess I have to. I’m not ashamed. You can’t be ashamed of something that just happens. He was rude and ungrateful, but I understand. It’s like a mistreated dog, lashing out. He was bitter and snarling. I don’t know why I care, but I do. I love him. I’ll search all of Africa for him, barefoot. I’d die for him, work for him, steal for him. I’d beg or borrow for him! Now you know!” Suzanne studied me for a while. “You’re not like most English, Gipsy girl. You’re practical and passionate. It’s something to care. But your little doctor man is lucky you didn’t marry him. So, no message to Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “And you believe he’s innocent?” “Innocent people can be hanged.” “Anne, face the facts. He might have murdered her.” “No, he wouldn’t. If he did it, he would have used his hands,” I asserted. Suzanne shivered. “I see why you’re attracted to him!” The next morning, I had a chance to speak to Colonel Race. The auction was over, and we strolled on the deck. “How’s the gipsy today? Missing her caravan?” “Now that the sea is calm, I want to stay on it forever,” I replied. We gazed at the sea, the colors vibrant. “That story about the diamonds was intriguing,” I mentioned. “Which one?” “The one with two young men.” “Lucas? He went to War, missing and wounded, believed dead.” I stopped my questions, pondering Colonel Race’s involvement. I also spoke to the night steward, learning more with a bit of persuasion.",1
"""I was just chatting with Miller, the investigator working on the Davenheim case,"" I overheard. The mysterious vanishing of Mr. Davenheim, a prominent figure in the banking world, had captured headlines for days. Eager to learn more, I engaged in conversation with Japp, hoping for some intriguing insights. ""In this day and age, disappearing seems nearly impossible,"" I mused. Poirot, adjusting a plate of bread and butter with precision, interjected sharply: ""Accuracy is key, my friend.""",1
"Poirot was about to call the police, but the man begged him not to. Poirot pushed the man down the steps and they hurried inside and locked the door. Poirot led them into a room, instructing the Italian to hide behind a curtain. Just in time, a woman burst into the room looking for her husband. Poirot reassured her and introduced himself. The Italian emerged brandishing a revolver, causing the woman to panic. Poirot calmed her down and she revealed the secret hiding place of incriminating evidence. Poirot let her go and assured her escape, before the Italian attempted to shoot her, only to find the gun unloaded. Poirot scolded him for carrying a loaded weapon and assured the safety of all involved.",1

I much prefer the courteous manners of the past. So, my dear colleague, do not hesitate to give me any orders. We are both quite knowledgeable, aren't we?"" chuckling heartily, M. Hautet bid us farewell. Regrettably, Poirot's initial comment to me as we walked through the hallway was: ""That renowned old fool! Utterly foolish!"" Just as we exited the premises, we encountered Giraud, looking even more fashionable than before, and thoroughly content with himself.",1
"""Perhaps my husband went out for a walk and forgot to lock it when he returned,"" she suggested.""Is that likely?"" the inspector inquired.""Very much so. My husband was incredibly absent-minded,"" she replied, a slight furrow on her forehead hinting at past annoyances.The inspector noted, ""If they made him dress himself, it implies that the location they were taking him to, where 'the secret' was hidden, was quite a distance away.""""Indeed, but not too far, as he mentioned returning by morning,"" the magistrate added.""What time does the last train depart from Merlinville station?"" Poirot questioned.""At eleven fifty-one in one direction, and twelve seventeen in the other, but they likely had a waiting car,"" the inspector explained.""Of course,"" Poirot agreed, looking slightly disappointed. ""It could be a way to track them,"" the magistrate suggested, brightening. ""A motor with two foreigners would surely have been noticed. That's a good point, M. Bex."" He then turned to Mrs. Renauld, asking, ""Do you know anyone named 'Duveen'?""""Duveen?"" she repeated, pausing to think. ""No, not that I can recall.""""Has your husband ever mentioned someone by that name?"" he probed.""Never,"" she replied firmly.""Do you know anyone with the first name 'Bella'?"" he continued, observing her closely for any signs of recognition, but she simply shook her head in denial.""Was your husband visited by anyone last night?"" he inquired, noticing a slight blush rise in her cheeks. ""No, who was it?"" she questioned.""A lady,"" he revealed.""Really?"" Madame Daubreuil seemed unlikely to have any connection to the crime, and he didn't want to upset Mrs. Renauld unnecessarily. He motioned to the commissary, who returned with the glass jar and the dagger. ""Madame, do you recognize this?"" he asked gently.Her cry of recognition was immediate. ""Yes, that's my little dagger.""Upon seeing the bloodied tip, her horror was evident. ""Is that blood?""""Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon,"" he confirmed, swiftly removing it from view.""Are you certain it's the same one that was on your dressing table last night?"" he inquired.""Oh, absolutely. It was a gift from my son, who served in the Air Force during the War. He lied about his age to enlist,"" she shared proudly. ""It's made from a streamlined airplane wire and was given to me as a War memento.""""I understand, madame. This leads us to another matter. Where is your son now? We need to contact him urgently,"" he pressed.""Jack? He's en route to Buenos Ayres,"" she disclosed.""What?"" he exclaimed in surprise.""Yes, my husband wired him yesterday. Jack was sent to Paris on business, but it turned out he needed to travel immediately to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he was instructed to catch it,"" she explained.""Do you have any idea about the nature of his business in Buenos Ayres?"" he inquired.""No, I'm unaware of the details, but Buenos Ayres isn't his final destination. He's heading from there to Santiago,"" she clarified.""Santiago! Once again, Santiago!"" the magistrate and the commissary remarked in unison.",1
"We said our goodbyes. His departing words were, ‘You pride yourself on your intelligence, my dear,’ he stated. ‘I may not have a formal education, but nevertheless, I am willing to match wits with you anytime. Time will reveal who the victor will be.’ “That was nearly a decade ago. I would occasionally visit him for a weekend, and although we got along well, his beliefs never wavered. He never brought up my academic achievements, whether it be my matriculation or my B.Sc. Over the last three years, his health had been deteriorating, and a month ago he passed away. “I have now arrived at the reason for my presence. My uncle’s will is quite peculiar.",1
"“And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him.” “Who?” I asked. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.” “What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know but a scar can be faked easily enough. He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of anthropology. “Dolichocephalic,” I said lightly. Suzanne looked doubtful. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,” I explained fluently. There was a pause. I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean the opposite?” “Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.” “Brachycephalic,” I murmured unwillingly. “That’s it. I thought that was what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said with all the assurance I could muster. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she laughed. “You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.” “There’s nothing to tell,” I said unwillingly. “Isn’t there?” said Suzanne gently. “I suppose I shall have to tell you,” I said slowly. “I’m not ashamed of it. You can’t be ashamed of something that just happens to you. That’s what he did. He was detestable rude and ungrateful but that I think I understand. It’s like a dog that’s been chained up or badly treated it’ll bite anybody. That’s what he was like bitter and snarling. I don’t know why I care but I do. I care horribly. Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down. I love him. I want him. I’ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I find him, and I’ll make him care for me. I’d die for him. I’d work for him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him! There now you know!” Suzanne looked at me for a long time. “You’re very un-English, Gipsy girl,” she said at last. “There’s not a scrap of the sentimental about you. I’ve never met any one who was at once so practical and so passionate. I shall never care for any one like that mercifully for me and yet and yet I envy you, Gipsy girl. It’s something to be able to care. Most people can’t. But what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn’t marry him. He doesn’t sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy keeping high explosive in the house! So there’s to be no cabling to Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “And yet you believe him to be innocent?” “I also believe that innocent people can be hanged.” “Hm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In spite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.” “No,” I said. “He didn’t.” “That’s sentiment.” “No, it isn’t. He might have killed her. He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!” I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head. “Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress. “That was a very interesting story you told us last night,” I said, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always interested in diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.” “And what happened to him eventually, I mean. Does any one know?” Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions. Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed.” That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I got it all out of him, little by little.",1
"In the event that you are stopped along the way, I can supply you with two separate passes. One issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor unaffiliated with the Union."" ""One for your people, and one for the strikers, right?"" ""Exactly."" The proposal did not interest me - I know what occurs in such cases. You become flustered and mix things up. I would likely hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, leading to my untimely demise by either a bloodthirsty rebel or a supporter of law and order, as I see them patrolling the streets in bowler hats, smoking pipes, and rifles carelessly slung under their arms. Plus, what would I even do in Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of gunfire in Johannesburg? I would be confined there for who knows how long. They have already blown up the railway line, I hear. And one can't even get a drink there. The place has been under martial law for two days now. ""My friend,"" I remarked, ""you fail to understand that I am observing conditions on the Rand. How could I possibly observe them from Pretoria? Thank you for your concern for my safety, but rest assured, I will manage."" ""Sir Eustace, I must caution you that the food situation is becoming dire."" ""A bit of fasting will do wonders for my figure,"" I replied with a sigh. Our conversation was interrupted by the delivery of a telegram. I read it with disbelief: ""Anne is safe. Here with me in Kimberley. Suzanne Blair."" I never truly believed in Anne's disappearance. There is something remarkably resilient about that young woman - she is like the indestructible balls one gives to terriers. She has a knack for reappearing with a smile. I still can't fathom why she felt the need to leave the hotel in the dead of night to reach Kimberley. There were no trains running, after all. She must have sprouted angel's wings and flown there. And I doubt she will ever offer an explanation. Nobody ever does with me. I always have to guess. It gets tiresome after a while. I suppose it's all in service of journalism. ""How I navigated the rapids,"" by our Special Correspondent. I folded up the telegram and bid farewell to my Governmental acquaintance. I am not thrilled about the thought of going hungry, but I am not fearful for my safety. Smuts is more than capable of handling the uprising. However, I would pay a handsome sum for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the foresight to bring a bottle of whisky when he arrives tomorrow? I donned my hat and headed out, planning to pick up a few souvenirs. The curio shops in Jo'burg are quite charming. I was admiring a window display of grand karosses when a man exiting the shop collided with me. To my surprise, it was Race. I can't say he seemed delighted to see me. In fact, he appeared quite irritated, but I insisted he join me back at the hotel.",1
"""But what if it wasn't her sister's dagger, but the one Jack gave to Marthe Daubreuil? If that were the case, Bella Duveen's dagger would remain untouched! I didn't say a word to you, Hastings (there was no time for romance). Instead, I found Mademoiselle Dulcie and disclosed what was necessary, instructing her to search through her sister's belongings. My excitement soared when she came to me (following my directions) as Miss Robinson, holding the precious memento! Meanwhile, I had already taken actions to lure Mademoiselle Marthe out into the open.""",1
"""Can you believe it, Poirot? The chambermaid was the culprit all along,"" I exclaimed, shocked at the revelation. Poirot merely chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. ""Indeed, my friend, appearances can be deceiving,"" he replied cryptically. The mystery of the stolen necklace had finally been solved, thanks to Poirot's ingenious plan to uncover the truth. As we left the scene of the crime behind us, I couldn't help but marvel at the brilliance of my quirky little friend. Our next adventure awaited, and I knew that with Poirot by my side, there was no puzzle we couldn't solve.",1
"“I recognize the name, but it doesn’t ring a bell right now. What does she do?” “I’m not sure, but take a look at her picture.” After a brief moment of inspection, Mr. Aarons exclaimed, “I remember now!” He enthusiastically patted his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, of course!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “Yes, they are a duo of sisters. They perform as acrobats, dancers, and singers. Quite talented. They’re currently touring in the provinces, or possibly taking a break. I think they just finished a run in Paris.” “Could you please find out their exact location for me?” “No problem. Just head home, and I’ll have the information for you in the morning.”",1
"As various individuals attempted to make small talk in the casual setting of a boat, I couldn't help but notice how Mrs. Blair skillfully rebuffed their advances. It was clear that she had chosen the strong, silent man as her companion for the journey, and he seemed to appreciate the position. The next day, to my surprise, Mrs. Blair interrupted my solitude after a stroll with her companion. ""Feeling better today?"" she inquired. I expressed my gratitude for her concern, admitting that I was starting to feel more human. ""You looked quite unwell yesterday. Colonel Race and I were almost looking forward to a sea burial, but you've thwarted our plans,"" she remarked with a teasing smile. I chuckled in response.",1
"""Look at how 'Peerage' has been rearranged! The tallest books on the top shelf, the next tallest below, and so on. Order and method, as I always say, Hastings."" ""Exactly,"" I quickly replied, placing the book back in its proper place. Lord Yardly, a cheerful and boisterous sportsman with a red face, exuded a friendly charm that made up for any lack of intellect. ""Quite the puzzling situation, Monsieur Poirot. My wife and Miss Marvell have been receiving strange letters.""",1
"And what choice did I have? None. In just fifteen minutes, I would be departing from the station, leaving Pagett behind as he waved goodbye. He had managed to outmaneuver me skillfully. Furthermore, his attitude towards me had shifted. It was filled with a forced friendliness that didn't suit him, making my stomach turn. This man was a deceitful hypocrite. After attempting to kill me, he now showered me with flattery! Did he really think I didn't recognize him that fateful night on the boat? No, it was all an act, one that he expected me to go along with, all the while hiding his true intentions.",1
"""He observed a figure emerging from Sir Eustace’s quarters and trailed him to the upper deck. Does that align with his statement? Now, who resided in the cabin across from Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Imagine if Colonel Race stealthily ascended to the deck, and, thwarted in his assault on you, hastily circled the deck and encountered Pagett just entering through the saloon entrance. He strikes him and swiftly retreats inside, shutting the door behind him. We rush over and discover Pagett sprawled on the floor. What do you make of that?” “You overlook the fact that he adamantly insists it was you who struck him down.""",1
"” “At fancy Italian resorts?” “Inexpensive if you know where to look.” I studied her closely. “But you weren’t planning on being here when we first crossed paths, were you?” “We all face setbacks,” Miss Cinderella remarked wisely. “Now, I’ve shared enough. Curiosity isn’t a good trait for young boys. So, why are you here? Tagging along with the M.P., I presume, playing the carefree youth on the shore.” I disagreed. “Think again. Remember when I mentioned my close friend is a detective?” “Yes?” “And I’m sure you’re familiar with the recent incident at the Chateau Belle?” She gazed at me.'",1
"Approaching closer, Madame Daubreuil's complexion regained a hint of color as she gazed down at the victim with a hint of intrigue. ""I have never seen him before,"" she stated, her words sounding genuine. Giraud nodded, indicating she could leave, prompting me to question the decision quietly. ""Are you sure it's wise to let her go? That black hair likely belongs to her."" With a dry tone, Giraud responded, ""I know how to handle my business. She is being watched. No need to arrest her just yet.""",1
"""Why did you not inform M. Hautet this morning that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack Renauld’s face turned red. “You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining magistrate.” Poirot narrowed his eyes at him. “Then it is a peculiar mistake that I have made, shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” Jack Renauld hesitated, then said: “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of being involved in my father’s murder?” He asked haughtily. “I’d like an explanation of why you’re here.” “I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil. I was about to leave on a long voyage and wanted to see her before I went, to assure her of my devotion.” “Did you see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left him. There was a pause before Renauld replied. “Yes.” “And then?” “I missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I found a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “Fifteen kilometers. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I felt like walking.” Poirot accepted the explanation and Renauld left. Poirot quickly got up. “Quick, Hastings. We will follow him.” We discreetly followed him through the streets of Merlinville until he turned to the station. “He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac and inquire about the valise left by the foreigners. Yes, all that was my invention.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your insight is remarkable, Hastings! Now, let’s go to the Villa Geneviève.” “By the way, Poirot,” I said as we walked, “I have an issue with you going to the Hôtel du Phare without telling me.” Poirot glanced at me. “And how did you know I went there?” he asked. “I saw you passing by,” I explained. Poirot only shook his head. “I apologize if I offended you. You will understand soon. But I have focused on the case.” “It’s fine,” I said. “I know you have my best interests at heart. But I can take care of myself.” Poirot seemed about to say something else, but stopped. At the Villa, Poirot led me to the shed where the body was found. He did not go in but paused by the bench. After a moment, he walked to the hedge marking the boundary. “With luck,” he said, “Mademoiselle Marthe may be in the garden. I want to speak to her. Ah, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! Un moment, s’il vous plaît.” Marthe Daubreuil came up to him looking troubled. “Do you remember asking me about the suspects?” Poirot asked. ""Will you ask me again?"" “What do you mean?” “I would answer differently now. M. Jack Renauld is suspected.” “Jack? Impossible. Who suspects him?” “Giraud.” “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will he will ” She stopped. Courage and determination filled her face. Poirot watched her closely. “You know he was here on the night of the murder?” he said. “Yes,” she replied. “He told me.” “It was unwise to hide that,” Poirot remarked. “We must find something to save him,” she said. “The facts will be against him,” Poirot warned. “You understand that?” She faced him firmly, using the words I had heard her say before. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and face the facts.""",1
"""An elderly man stood by the mantelpiece, his shoulders slightly stooped. Dr. Durand was his name. “Most extraordinary,” M. Hautet remarked after the commissary spoke. “Do you have the letter, Monsieur?” Poirot handed it over, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. A secret is mentioned. What a pity he did not provide more details. We are grateful for your help, M. Poirot. Will you assist in our investigations? Or must you return to London?” “M. le juge, I intend to stay. I may not have arrived in time to save my client, but I feel compelled by honor to uncover the killer.""",1
"I briefed Cinderella on how the discovery unfolded, and she paid close attention, occasionally posing insightful questions. We then headed towards the Villa, with me being cautious, not eager to encounter anyone. Leading the girl through the shrubbery to the rear of the house, where the small shed stood, I recalled that M. Bex had entrusted the key to Marchaud the previous evening. It was possible that the Sûreté detective had returned it to Marchaud after using it.",1
"""That’s no ordinary match, not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Fortunately, it remains unlit. Otherwise, I wouldn't have recognized it. Clearly, one of the men tossed away his cigarette end, and lit another, dropping one match out of the box in the process.” “And the other match?” inquired Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he used to light his cigarette. Have you found that as well?” “No.” “Maybe you didn’t search thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly.” The detective appeared on the verge of losing his temper, but managed to keep his composure. “I see you enjoy a good joke, M. Poirot.”",1
"Mme. Renauld emerged in the doorway after a brief moment. Despite her resolve, her complexion was notably ashen. M. Hautet followed closely behind, offering sympathetic words in a flurry. She gestured for a pause. “Give me a moment, gentlemen, to compose myself.” After a deep breath, she removed her hand from her face and gazed at the lifeless body before her. The extraordinary composure she had displayed thus far crumbled in an instant. “Paul!” she wailed. “My dear husband! Oh, heavens!” With a sudden lurch, she collapsed to the floor in a faint. Without delay, Poirot rushed to her side, checking her vital signs with practiced ease. Once he confirmed her unconscious state, he stepped back.",1
"""There are certain situations where a man may choose to wear pajamas with an overcoat, while the other option remains highly unlikely,"" I replied. Poirot interjected, ""We must redirect our focus to unraveling the enigma of the unlocked door. I am quite certain that they did not exit through the door; the window was their means of escape."" Surprised, I questioned, ""The window?"" Poirot affirmed, ""Exactly."" I countered, ""But there were no footprints in the flower bed below."" Poirot nodded, ""Indeed, and there should have been. Consider this, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, mentioned that he had planted both flower beds the day before.""",1
"They appeared as a pair of strikingly charming children. As they started to perform, their voices, while delicate and somewhat musical, held an undeniable allure. Their dance moves were precise, accompanied by impressive acrobatic displays. The lyrics of their songs were lively and memorable. The audience responded with a round of enthusiastic applause as the curtain closed, signaling the triumph of the Dulcibella Kids. Feeling a sudden urge to leave, I proposed to Poirot that we depart. ""Certainly, my friend. I am content here and will remain until the conclusion,"" he replied.",1
"""And what about Mrs. Ferguson?"" inquired Parker. ""Let's hear your deductions, Hastings."" ""It's elementary, my dear Watson,"" I quipped. ""She simply went to the incorrect apartment."" ""Impressive, Captain Hastings,"" Mrs. Robinson exclaimed with admiration. In that moment, I found myself yearning for Poirot's presence. At times, I believe he underestimates my abilities. The entire situation was quite amusing, so I presented it as a playful puzzle to Poirot the next day. He appeared intrigued, probing me for details on flat rents in different areas. ""An intriguing tale,"" he mused.",1
"Poirot and Hastings were deep in discussion, trying to unravel the mystery of the crime that had taken place. Poirot was convinced that the key to the case lay in the details surrounding Mr. Renauld's murder. As they debated various theories, Hastings suggested that perhaps the open door was a clue that had been overlooked. Poirot considered this idea, but shook his head, indicating that there was more to the case than met the eye. He was certain that the solution to the mystery lay elsewhere, and that the truth would soon be revealed.",1
"""Given his urgent demeanor, I promptly presented his card, identifying him as Mr. Roger Havering,"" she said, handing me the slip of paper. Poirot directed me to the bookcase, where I retrieved ""Who's Who."" After scanning the pages, he noted, ""Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb."" ""Ah,"" I mused. ""I believe she was the actress at the Frivolity, though she went by Zoe Carrisbrook. I recall her marrying a young socialite before the War.""",1
"“Françoise’s account appears to be accurate,” he confided in me. “I've been in touch with headquarters. It seems that in the past six weeks, ever since M. Renauld's arrival in Merlinville, Madame Daubreuil has deposited a significant amount of money into her bank account three times. The total sum adds up to two hundred thousand francs!” “My goodness,” I mused, “that's around four thousand pounds, isn't it?” “Exactly. It's clear that he was completely smitten.”",1
"“But did you really believe her when she said the letters were destroyed? Women never destroy letters if they can help it. It’s not in their nature.” “I know, I know,” I replied, feeling my frustration growing. “But you’ve completely embarrassed me! From start to finish! No, it’s easy to come up with excuses after the fact. There has to be a line somewhere!” “You were having such a good time, my friend. I couldn’t bring myself to ruin it for you.” “It doesn’t matter. You’ve crossed a line this time.” “Oh dear! Why do you get so worked up over nothing, my friend?” “I’ve had enough!” I stormed out, slamming the door behind me.",1
"At the sensation of the icy water, he jolted awake and sat upright. ""Stay put, please,"" I instructed. He was the type of young man who recovered quickly from a shock. Pushing himself up, he stood unsteadily. ""No need for assistance, thank you,"" he declared defiantly, with a hint of aggression. Not a hint of gratitude or manners! ""That's quite a nasty gash. Let me help bandage it up."" ""Absolutely not,"" he retorted, throwing the words at me as if I had been the one asking for a favor. My temper, always simmering, began to boil.",1
"At the sight of her son, caught between the two enforcers of the law, she froze in shock. ""Jack,"" she whispered. ""Jack, what's going on?"" He met her gaze, his expression impassive. ""I've been taken into custody, mother."" ""What?"" Her cry was sharp, piercing the air, before she collapsed to the ground. Hastening to her side, we quickly lifted her limp form. After a moment, Poirot rose to his feet. ""She's sustained a nasty gash on her head, most likely from the stairwell. There may be a mild concussion as well. If Giraud needs a statement from her, he'll have to wait.""",1
"""I wandered aimlessly, completely unaware that I was pushing the poor girl to her breaking point. Had she succeeded in stabbing me, I would have had it coming. Her bravery in coming forward now is truly admirable. I was prepared to face the consequences, right until the very end."" There was a brief pause before he changed the subject: ""What baffles me is why the Governor was wandering around in his undergarments and my coat in the dead of night.""",1
"""I would never consider marrying someone unless I was completely in love with them. Women often find joy in doing things they dislike for the one they love. The more stubborn she is, the more satisfaction she finds."" ""I have to disagree with you on that. Usually, it's the other way around,"" he said with a hint of disdain. ""That's exactly it!"" I exclaimed excitedly. ""That's why so many marriages end in unhappiness. It's all the men's fault. They either give in to their wives and end up being despised, or they are selfish, always insisting on their own way without ever showing gratitude.""",1
"I met her eyes squarely. ""Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.""",1
"""I've already mentioned it to Mary. But she's a typical woman, always wanting to be the center of attention when it comes to jewelry."" ""That's absurd, Gregory!"" Mary Marvell snapped back, her face turning red with anger. Poirot raised his shoulders in a shrug. ""Madam, I have given my advice. That is all I can do. It is finished."" He escorted them to the door and then returned. ""Ah! Women's stories! The good husband, though lacking tact, hit the nail on the head. Definitely."" I shared my vague recollections with him, and he nodded in agreement. ""Just as I suspected. However, there is something peculiar lurking beneath the surface of all this.""",1
"""Furthermore, there is additional evidence that, prior to his demise, he was engaged in a romantic entanglement with a French woman, known as Madame Daubreuil, who resides in the neighboring Villa. Can you believe that this is the same man who, as you claim, had no interest in women's company?"" The secretary's gaze sharpened. ""Wait a minute, Judge. You're on the wrong track. I was acquainted with Paul Renauld. What you are suggesting is simply not possible. There must be some other explanation."" The judge shrugged. ""Then what alternative explanation do you propose?"" ""On what basis do you conclude it was a romantic relationship?"" ""Madame Daubreuil would frequently visit him here in the evenings.""",1
"“Mr. Hautet, I swear I am innocent of my father’s murder,” protested the accused. The magistrate’s fleeting uncertainty vanished as he let out a mocking chuckle. “Innocent they always claim to be, our prisoners! Your words alone condemn you. No defense, no alibi, just a feeble denial. You thought the money would be yours after his death, so you killed Renauld in a cold, calculated manner. Your mother, an accomplice, may receive leniency for her maternal instincts, but not you.”",1
"“My word, wasn’t it the elderly woman poisoned in Essex?” I confirmed. “That marked Poirot’s initial major investigation. Without a doubt, he prevented the killer from getting away unpunished. Truly remarkable detective work.” As I delved deeper into the details, leading up to the satisfying and surprising conclusion, the young woman was captivated by the story. So engrossed were we that we arrived at Calais station without even noticing. “Good heavens!” exclaimed my fellow traveler.",1
"As we journeyed through the vast and ever-changing landscapes, there was always something fascinating to behold. From the breathtaking beauty of the Hex river valley to the haunting desolation of the Karoo, and finally the endless straight path in Bechuanaland. At each stop, which barely resembled a station, a swarm of natives emerged from the barren surroundings, offering their handmade treasures. Suzanne was captivated, quickly starting a collection of the intricately carved wooden animals they presented.",1
"""Suzanne, I believe we've stumbled upon a breakthrough in the case,"" I exclaimed. ""It all revolves around the mysterious appointment in Cabin 17 on the 22nd."" Suzanne's eyes widened in realization. ""Yes, but what about the connection to Madame Nadina, the Russian dancer?"" I paused, struck by a sudden thought. ""What if the films that Mrs. Blair received were meant for Nadina? And what if they were a crucial piece of evidence in this whole tangled web of deceit?"" Suzanne gasped, her eyes alight with newfound understanding. ""It all makes sense now. The answer lies in those missing films. We must find them.""",1
"“There’s a certain cold precision in his manner that was missing from the real doctor. Plus, a doctor wouldn’t typically check for the heart on the right side of the chest.” “Are you saying he did that?” “Yes, I didn’t pick up on it right away, but I had a feeling something was off. It all clicked for me later when I got home.” “Interesting,” remarked the detective. He slowly pulled out a pen and paper. “By examining the upper body, he could easily have taken whatever he pleased from the pockets.” “I find that hard to believe,” the detective replied.",1
"“Never have I loved you like this!” Her lips softly grazed my cheek before finding mine, showering me with kisses filled with a passion that seemed unreal. The intensity of the moment, the sheer astonishment of it, will be etched in my memory forever. A noise from the doorway interrupted us, causing us to glance up. Poirot stood there, watching us intently. Without a second thought, I sprang towards him and restrained his arms. ""Hurry,"" I whispered to the woman. ""Leave now. Run as fast as you can. I'll handle him."" With a swift glance in my direction, she dashed out of the room. I held Poirot firmly, not letting him budge. ""My friend,"" remarked Poirot calmly, ""you are quite skilled at this type of thing.""",1
"""I have uncovered the truth,"" she declared confidently. ""You were not in Cannes on January 8th as you claimed, but rather in Marlow. And when Madame Nadina betrayed you, you conspired to eliminate her. The evidence points directly to you as the culprit behind the crime."" Sir Eustace raised an eyebrow. ""And who is your source for these accusations? The man currently evading the police? His testimony will surely not hold up in court."" She smirked. ""We have corroborating evidence. Someone else knew of Nadina's meeting with you at the Mill House."" Sir Eustace's expression shifted, betraying his surprise.",1
"‘Is it possible for a man to shoot himself like this? Show me,’ he demands. Reluctantly, the foolish man obliges, placing the rifle in his mouth. She crouches, playfully touching the trigger, a mischievous smile on her face. ‘Well, sir,’ she teases, ‘what if I were to pull it?’ “And just like that, Hastings, she does!” In my documented cases, Poirot always begins with a central fact - murder or theft - and cleverly unravels the mystery through logical deduction.",1
"Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got lots of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement. “Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds! Diamonds! I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. “Are you sure, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear. I’ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts. They’re beauties too, Anne and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me. Was it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for my benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately “pumped.” For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in? What possible connection could he have with the affair? “Who is Colonel Race?” I asked. “That’s rather a question,” said Suzanne. “He’s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this trip. He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be rolling. You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence my husband, you know. It’s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.” “It must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like you.” “Well, I’m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and goes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married even to Clarence!” I disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all. Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.” “But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow. She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow. What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It looks as though he had some hold over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested in spite of myself. “You don’t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he’s a most capable and hard-working young man. And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.” “What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know but a scar can be faked easily enough.",1
"""When she finally confessed to the murder, I thought it was the end of it. But something didn't sit right with me. I revisited the case and came to the same conclusion - it had to be either Bella Duveen or Marthe Daubreuil. The letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie gave me the breakthrough I needed. The missing dagger, stolen by Dulcie Duveen, revealed the true culprit. With some discreet guidance, the pieces fell into place and Marthe Daubreuil's true colors were exposed. It was a risky move, but it paid off. The events unfolded just as I had anticipated, and Marthe Daubreuil's attempt to claim the Renauld fortune was thwarted.""",1
"That evening, Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a man, who refused to give his name, wanted to speak with me privately. Wary of insurance agents, I instructed Jarvis to turn him away. Guy Pagett, typically reliable, was unfortunately unwell with a bilious attack. It seemed that the hard-working young men often fell victim to such ailments. When Jarvis returned, he revealed, ""The man says he is here on behalf of Mr. Milray."" This unexpected connection changed everything.",1
"""As we rushed to the Magnificent in a taxi, I pondered the intricacies of the plan. The 'full moon' ruse was quite ingenious, diverting our attention to Friday and leaving us vulnerable earlier. Poirot seemed unfazed, his usual composure returning swiftly. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for him - failure was not something he took lightly. 'Don't worry,' I reassured him. 'There's always another chance.' Upon arrival at the Magnificent, we were promptly led to the manager's office.""",1
"The love between us had to withstand scrutiny, and once my parents acknowledged its depth, they would surely come around. I had not shared with her my father's main concern about our relationship. I quickly realized that force would not help my case. My father sent me many caring letters from Paris, avoiding any mention of our dispute or its roots, and I responded in kind."" ""You have those letters, right?"" asked Giraud. ""I didn't hold on to them."" ""Doesn't matter,"" the detective replied.",1
"Rayburn was crouched next to the man sprawled out near the saloon entrance. I rushed over, out of breath, and asked, ""Did you have to hit him?"" Rayburn's response was cold, ""No need. He was already like this when I found him. Or maybe he's faking. Let's find out who he is."" Anxious, I edged closer. It was clear that the man who attacked me was much larger than Chichester. Unlike Chichester, who was weak and flabby, this man seemed capable of using brute force. Rayburn lit a match, and we both gasped in shock.",1
"I will return to you later.” It was just a short walk from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat staring into the empty grate. The door opened, and I turned, expecting Poirot. But to my surprise, it was Cinderella standing in the doorway. She spoke nervously, her breath coming in gasps. “I saw you outside. You and your friend. Why are you here in Coventry? Is the man with you the detective?” She stood there, fear evident in her voice. And in that moment, I understood everything understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last my own heart.… “Yes,” I said gently. “Is he looking for me?” she whispered. Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she burst into tears. I knelt by her, holding her in my arms. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know I know everything.” “Oh, but you don’t!” “I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked: “It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action. “Why did you take the dagger?” I asked. She replied simply: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes met mine, and she asked in a little quiet voice: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and whispered: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused. “Go on what next?” “I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links ” Again I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused. “You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely. “And you love me? Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which way to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!” Again I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could. “Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it and the wonder, I shall not forget no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “Mon ami,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “Mon Dieu! no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! Eh bien, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.” “There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! Eh bien! it comes to this are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well I warned you. When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “Mon ami! Vive l’amour! It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!” After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned. Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being. But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act but I could not rest easy in my mind. Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what your plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.” “But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France without delay.” “We?” “Precisely ‘we!’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish ” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard which every one would perceive, bien entendu I much prefer that we should voyage together. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you ” “I know I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient.”",1
"“I had to come clean, Anne. The moment I started suspecting Colonel Race, I got really anxious about the diamonds. I stayed put at the Falls, just in case he had taken you somewhere nearby, but I was clueless about what to do with the diamonds. I was too scared to hold onto them,” Suzanne glanced nervously around, as if worried about eavesdroppers, and then whispered urgently in my ear. “A very wise move,” I agreed. “At the time, at least. It’s a bit tricky now. What happened to the cases?” “The large ones were shipped to Cape Town. Pagett informed me before I left the Falls, and he included the storage receipt. He’s departing from Cape Town today, to meet Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I understand,” I mused. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I assume Sir Eustace has them with him.” I pondered the situation. “Well,” I finally said, “it’s inconvenient but secure. We should wait for now.” Suzanne gave me a small smile. “You’re not a fan of inactivity, are you, Anne?” “Not really,” I admitted. The only thing I could do was to check the train schedule to see when Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I discovered it was due to arrive at 5.40 the next afternoon and depart at 6. I wanted to meet Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed like a good opportunity. The situation in the Rand was becoming dire, and it might be a while before I had another chance. The only bright spot in the day was a telegram sent from Johannesburg. A seemingly innocent message: “Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.” Eric was our code name for Race. I picked it because I detested the name. There was nothing to be done until I could speak with Pagett. Suzanne occupied herself by sending a lengthy reassuring cable to Clarence, far away. She seemed quite sentimental towards him. In her own way, different from me and Harry, she genuinely cared for Clarence. “I wish he was here, Anne,” she sniffled. “It’s been so long since I’ve seen him.” “Have some face cream,” I offered soothingly. Suzanne dabbed a bit on her nose. “I’ll need more face cream soon,” she remarked, “and this kind can only be found in Paris.” She sighed. “Paris!” “Suzanne,” I said, “you’ll grow tired of South Africa and adventure very soon.” “I’d love a really nice hat,” Suzanne admitted wistfully. “Should I accompany you to meet Guy Pagett tomorrow?” “I’d rather go alone. He might be more hesitant speaking in front of both of us.” And so, the next afternoon, I found myself at the hotel entrance, struggling with an uncooperative parasol, while Suzanne lay contentedly on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit. According to the hotel porter, the train was surprisingly punctual that day, although he doubted it would make it through to Johannesburg, as he solemnly informed me that the line had been sabotaged. It was a cheerful thought! The train arrived just ten minutes late. Passengers spilled out onto the platform and began pacing anxiously. Pagett was easy to spot. I approached him eagerly. He visibly jumped at the sight of me this time. “Goodness, Miss Beddingfeld, I thought you had vanished.” “I’ve reappeared,” I informed him gravely. “And how are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Quite well, thank you looking forward to resuming my duties with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I began, “there’s something I need to ask you. I hope you won’t take offense, but it’s more important than you realize. What were you doing in Marlow on the 8th of January last year?” He flinched. “Miss Beddingfeld I well” “You were there, weren’t you?” “I for personal reasons I was in the vicinity, yes.” “Can you tell me why?” “Sir Eustace hasn’t already told you?” “Sir Eustace? Does he know?” “I’m quite certain he does. I hoped he hadn’t identified me, but based on his hints and comments, it seems highly likely. In any case, I intended to confess everything and offer my resignation. He’s an odd man, Miss Beddingfeld, with a peculiar sense of humor. It seems to amuse him to keep me in suspense. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had known the truth for years.” I hoped that I would eventually understand what Pagett was talking about. He continued volubly: “It’s hard for a man of Sir Eustace’s stature to put himself in my shoes. I acknowledge that I was at fault, but it seemed like a harmless deceit. I would have preferred if he had confronted me directly instead of making sly jokes at my expense.” A whistle blew, and passengers began boarding the train. “Yes, Mr. Pagett,” I interjected, “I agree with your sentiments about Sir Eustace. But why Marlow?” “It was a mistake, but understandable given the circumstances yes, I still maintain, given the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I asked desperately. For the first time, Pagett seemed to realize I was asking a question. His focus shifted away from Sir Eustace and himself and rested on me. “I apologize, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I fail to see how this concerns you.” He was now back on the train, leaning down to converse with me. I felt at my wits' end. What does one do with a man like him? “If it’s so shameful that you wouldn’t dare speak of it to me” I began acrimoniously. Finally, I had struck a nerve. Pagett stiffened and flushed. “Shameful? Embarrassing? I don’t understand.” “Then enlighten me.” In three succinct sentences, he revealed the truth. At last, Pagett’s secret was out! It was nothing like I had anticipated. I made my way back to the hotel, where a telegram awaited me. I tore it open. It contained explicit instructions for me to proceed immediately to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I would be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I settled into a chair to engage in some profound contemplation.",1
"Why did the murder have to happen in my own home? Out of all the homes in the country, why choose my Mill House? What did I ever do to deserve this? Suzanne offered her sympathy once more as Sir Eustace continued in a tone filled with frustration. And to make matters worse, the man who committed the crime had the audacity to become my secretary. My secretary! I've had enough of them - they're either killers in disguise or troublemakers. Have you seen Pagett's bruised eye? It's time to put an end to this.",1
"Jack hurried to catch his train in Paris after retrieving his forgotten bag from the library. Meanwhile, Léonie shared details of a heated argument she witnessed between Jack and an unknown person. As Poirot decided to wait in the salon, I ventured out to observe Giraud's investigation methods. Suddenly, I collided with Cinderella, who seemed to be intrigued by the murder at Villa Geneviève. Despite my reluctance, she insisted on exploring the crime scene, displaying a morbid curiosity that unsettled me.",1
"As our people meticulously search through every inch of France, so do the French authorities. I have a sinking feeling that time is running out."" The tall detective grimly added, ""That is, if he's still breathing."" Japp's expression darkened. ""Yes, but there's something telling me he's still holding on."" Poirot concurred, ""Indeed, he's alive. But will we locate him in time? I, like all of you, never imagined he could remain hidden for so long."" The sound of the whistle signaled our departure into the Pullman car. Reluctantly, the train pulled away from the station. The journey was filled with tension as the Scotland Yard detectives huddled together, studying maps of Northern France with intense focus.",1
"""Anne had an agreement with me. She entered the snare willingly, hoping to catch him. We had a system of secret signals. Anne knew his telegram was fake. She wired both me and Race before coming here. Mrs. Blair has been in touch with us. I received the letter at your dictation. Race had discovered the secret exit from the curio-shop. The house was shelled. I must get you out, Anne. The game is up. Race's men followed me here. The murder of Nadina. I was in Marlow that day. You knew her, had a motive. I have the diamonds. Your only hope gone. We'll talk. I'll make a deal. You've got me cornered. I'll leave a signed confession if you let me escape.""",1
"He began with moans and cries, escalating to screams and frantic gestures, invoking the Virgin Mary and all the saints. Eventually, he shamefully descended and completed the journey on a small donkey. I have to confess, a trotting camel is no laughing matter for a novice. My muscles were sore for days. Finally, we approached the excavation site. A sunburned man with a gray beard, dressed in white and wearing a helmet, approached us. ""Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We got your message. I apologize for the lack of reception in Cairo. An unexpected event disrupted our plans completely."" Poirot turned pale. His hand, reaching for his clothes-brush, froze. ""Not another death?"" he whispered. ""Yes."" ""Sir Guy Willard?"" I exclaimed. ""No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider."" ""And the cause?"" Poirot demanded. ""Tetanus."" I went pale. There was a sense of malevolence all around me, insidious and threatening. A dreadful idea crossed my mind. What if I was next? ""Mon Dieu,"" Poirot said, barely audible, ""I cannot comprehend this. It is dreadful. Tell me, sir, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?"" ""I believe not. But Dr. Ames will give you more information than I can."" ""Ah, of course, you are not the doctor."" ""My name is Tosswill."" So, this was the British specialist Lady Willard had mentioned, a minor official at the British Museum. There was something serious and resolute about him that appealed to me. ""If you follow me,"" Dr. Tosswill said, ""I will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was eager to be updated upon your arrival."" We were led to a large tent in the camp. Dr. Tosswill lifted the flap and we went in. Three men were inside. ""Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,"" Tosswill announced. The youngest of the three men stood up and approached us. There was a hint of impulsiveness in his demeanor that reminded me of his mother. He was not as tanned as the others, and that, along with some weariness around his eyes, made him appear older than his twenty-two years. He seemed to be coping with a significant mental strain. He introduced his companions, Dr. Ames, a competent man in his thirties with a touch of gray at his temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a friendly, slender young man sporting horn-rimmed glasses. After a brief exchange, the secretary left, followed by Dr. Tosswill. We were alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames. ""Feel free to ask any questions you may have, Monsieur Poirot,"" Willard said. ""We are completely baffled by this strange series of tragedies, but it must be, it can only be, a coincidence.""",1
"""Anne, do you recognize that man over there?"" I inquired casually. ""Oh, is he your new secretary?"" she responded, a hint of curiosity in her voice.""Yes, that's Mr. Rayburn. Unfortunately, he hasn't been feeling well lately,"" I revealed.""Interesting. How long has he been working for you?"" Anne probed further, her eyes fixed on me.""Not too long, actually. I hired him right before my trip,"" I disclosed, trying to be vague.Anne didn't miss a beat. ""And who recommended him to you?"" she asked, her tone direct.I hesitated slightly before answering, ""An old friend put in a good word for him.""After that, Anne fell silent, lost in her own thoughts.",1
"""I'm an actress. No, not the kind you're thinking of - lunching at the Savoy covered with jewelry, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So's face cream.

""I'm American born, but I've spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now."" ""We?"" ""My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in.""",1
"I had the girl’s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn’t got it on you a minute ago?” “Yes, I had,” I replied. “It was in my stocking.” “I don’t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table. “The young are always so violent,” he said reproachfully. “Unable to use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk sense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of affairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are hopelessly outnumbered. Your momentary ascendency has been gained by an accident” “Has it?” Something in Harry’s voice, a grim raillery, seemed to attract Sir Eustace’s attention. He stared at him. “Has it?” said Harry again. “Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say.” Still covering him with the revolver, he went on: “The cards are against you this time. To begin with, listen to that!” That was a dull banging at the door below. There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race and his people. You didn’t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne.” A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him covered with the revolver. “So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up. It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race’s men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.” Sir Eustace turned suddenly. “Very clever. Very creditable. But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you.",1
"Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I had to find out if Chichester was on that boat. Whether to board it myself or not, I couldn't decide, but in the end I made up my mind to do so. Chichester had no idea that I had spotted him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would surely set more traps for me, but I was prepared. He was the one I was hunting, the one in search of the diamonds for the enigmatic “Colonel.” Unfortunately, as I reached the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was already sailing away from shore.",1
"""Perhaps if the ring were found nearby, one could argue that Davenheim himself had accidentally dropped it,"" Japp suggested. ""But why bother removing it from the body at all?"" I exclaimed. ""There could be a specific reason for that,"" Japp replied. ""Did you know that just past the lake, there's a small gate that leads to the hill? And within a three-minute walk, you'll find what? A lime kiln.""""Goodness!"" I gasped. ""So you're saying that the lime used to dispose of the body wouldn't harm the metal of the ring?""""Exactly,"" Japp confirmed. ""It appears to me,"" I remarked, ""that this clarifies everything. What a ghastly crime!"" Without a word, we both turned to Poirot.",1
"“His partners may have silenced and drugged him,” she pondered, “but I struggle to discern their motive. His value to them is minimal now, as he will undoubtedly be under intense surveillance until the enigma surrounding the Prime Minister is resolved.” “Could it be an attempt to mislead the authorities?” “If so, why the lack of effort? His account only mentions a cloth over his face, followed by darkness. There is no diversion in that. It appears quite close to reality.” “Very well,” she remarked, checking the time, “I believe it is time to head towards the station.”",1
"She resembled Cinderella, youthful but consumed by a craving for dark thrills, for excitement at all costs, disregarding decency and empathy. Despite the allure of her beauty, I couldn't shake my initial disapproval and aversion. Thoughts of my deceased mother flooded my mind. What would she think of this peculiar, modern version of girlhood? The painted pretty face masking a sinister mind within. ""Get off your pedestal,"" the woman interjected abruptly. ""And drop the pretentious act.""",1
"I never planned on dressing up, but seeing Pagett so uncomfortable was too good to resist. ""What are you talking about?"" I asked. ""We're definitely wearing costumes. You too."" Pagett hesitated. ""Then go check out the costumes at the barber shop,"" I instructed. ""I hope they have your size,"" Pagett mumbled, eyeing me up and down. Sometimes, without realizing it, Pagett can be quite rude. ""And book a table for six at the restaurant,"" I continued. ""We'll invite the Captain, the woman with the attractive legs, Mrs. Blair"" ""You won't find Mrs.",1
"Poirot and I sat on the grassy knoll, overlooking the sea, reviewing the case. The bathers' cries reached us faintly, the sea pale blue in the calm. Poirot encouraged me to arrange my ideas methodically. Madame Daubreuil's connection with the Beroldy Case was key. I had a sudden epiphany about Georges Conneau. Poirot embraced me warmly, impressed. I theorized that Conneau, driven by old grievances, had killed Renauld. Madame Daubreuil was involved, and Jack Renauld had been manipulated. Poirot appreciated the story but pointed out the lack of realism in my reconstruction. I defended my theory, suggesting Conneau had obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil. Poirot disagreed, questioning the plausibility of my supposition.",1
"I never knew what bêche-de-mer was, and I probably never will. I've made guesses before and they've always been wrong. In South Africa, they talk about a stoep, which I now know is the same as a veranda or a piazza. Pawpaws were another mystery to me until I had one for breakfast. I mistook it for a bad melon at first, but a Dutch waitress set me straight. Lemon juice and sugar made it much more palatable. I was glad to finally meet a pawpaw.",1
"""Poirot, I believe you were the last person to see the dagger. Is that correct?"" Inspector Giraud's piercing eyes bore into Poirot's. ""Oui, it is true,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""But I did not touch it, I did not take it."" ""Then who did?"" Giraud pressed, his tone accusatory. Poirot's gaze remained steady. ""That, my friend, is the question, is it not?"" The room fell into a tense silence as everyone pondered the implications of the missing dagger. It was a crucial piece of evidence, now vanished into thin air. The investigation had just taken a sharp turn, and the truth seemed more elusive than ever.",1
"""Forgive my impulsiveness, Philip,"" she began. ""Allow me to present Monsieur Hercule Poirot, a name you surely recognize, and his companion, Captain Hastings."" Ridgeway appeared taken aback. ""I am familiar with your reputation, Monsieur Poirot,"" he acknowledged, shaking hands. ""But I never suspected Esmée would seek your assistance with our dilemma."" ""I feared you would object, Philip,"" Miss Farquhar admitted softly. ""Hence my precautions,"" he replied, smiling.",1
"“Can I interest you in something unique? Exotic furs, rare curios?” “I'm looking for something truly extraordinary,” I replied. “It's for a special event. Can you show me what you have?” “Would you care to step into my private showroom? We house a variety of exclusive items there.” That's where I made a critical error. I thought I was being so clever. I followed him past the beaded curtains. (Anne’s Story Continues) Dealing with Suzanne was a challenge. She argued, she begged, she even cried before reluctantly agreeing to go along with my scheme. Eventually, I convinced her to follow my instructions precisely, and she came to the train station to bid me a tearful goodbye.",1
"He appeared kind and fatherly, treating me as a naive girl facing a cruel world. There was no use arguing. I knew my father, a great but poor man, left me with a disappointing inheritance. Mr. Flemming suggested I stay with them, an opportunity I eagerly accepted. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me warmly, as I tried to make myself look like the stereotypical orphan. Despite my doubts about my appearance, I was determined to find a job. My reflection in the mirror didn't seem to match the compliments I had received.",1
"""Get going immediately.” “Make sure to bundle up, sir,” the young aviator advised. “I can offer you a coat, if needed.” Poirot checked his bulky timepiece. He muttered under his breath: “Just enough time, just enough.” Then, he raised his head and courteously nodded to the young man. “I appreciate it, sir. However, I am not the one you will be flying. This gentleman here is your passenger.” With those words, he stepped aside, allowing a figure to emerge from the shadows. It was the second male captive who had departed in the alternate vehicle, and as his face was illuminated, I couldn't help but gasp in disbelief.",1
"""Shortly thereafter, I heard a commotion in the residence that seemed to have spooked them, leading to my husband being forcibly taken into my quarters in a state of undress."" ""Excuse me,"" Poirot interjected, ""is there no other way out of the dressing room?"" ""No, sir, only a door connecting to my room. They rushed my husband inside, the shorter man leading the way, the taller one following closely with a dagger in hand. Paul attempted to reach me, his eyes filled with anguish. He pleaded with his abductors. 'I need to talk to her,' he insisted.""",1
"""The elderly man never even glanced at a skirt. He only had eyes for his beloved wife. They were the most devoted couple I have ever known,"" M. Hautet stated, shaking his head gently. ""M. Stonor, we have concrete evidence of a love letter from this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of losing interest in her. Furthermore, we have additional evidence that, at the time of his death, he was engaged in a relationship with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who resides in the neighboring Villa. And this was the man who, according to your account, never paid attention to women's clothing!"" The secretary's eyes narrowed. ""Hold on, M. le juge. You are looking in the wrong direction. I was acquainted with Paul Renauld. What you have just mentioned is completely impossible. There must be another explanation."" The magistrate shrugged. ""And what other explanation could there be?"" ""What makes you think it was a romantic affair?"" ""Madame Daubreuil used to visit him here in the evenings. Also, since M. Renauld moved to Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has deposited large sums of money in the bank in cash. Altogether, the sum adds up to four thousand pounds of British currency."" ""I believe that's correct,"" Stonor said calmly. ""I transferred those amounts to him as he requested. But it was not a romantic relationship."" ""Ah! My God! Then what was it?"" ""Blackmail,"" Stonor snapped, slamming his hand on the table. ""That's what it was."" ""Ah! That's a thought!"" exclaimed the magistrate, visibly shaken. ""Blackmail,"" Stonor repeated. ""The old man was being extorted, and at a high rate too. Four thousand in just a couple of months. Phew! I told you earlier there was something mysterious about Renauld. Obviously, this Madame Daubreuil knew enough to apply pressure."" ""It is plausible,"" the commissary exclaimed excitedly. ""Certainly, it is possible."" ""Possible?"" Stonor bellowed. ""It's definite! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this alleged affair?"" ""No, sir. We did not want to cause her any distress if it could be avoided."" ""Distress? She would scoff in your face. I assure you, she and Renauld had an exceptional relationship."" ""Ah, that reminds me of something else,"" M. Hautet chimed in. ""Did M. Renauld confide in you about his will at all?"" ""I am aware of it, I took it to the solicitor for him after he had prepared it. I can give you the solicitors' name if you wish to see it. They have it on file. Quite simple. Half in trust for his wife during her lifetime, the other half for his son. A few bequests. I think he left me a thousand."" ""When was this will drafted?"" ""About a year and a half ago."" ""Would you be very surprised, Mr. Stonor, to learn that M. Renauld made another will less than a fortnight ago?"" Stonor was visibly shocked. ""I had no idea. What does it entail?"" ""The entirety of his considerable fortune is left entirely to his wife. There is no mention of his son."" Mr. Stonor let out a long whistle. ""I find that rather harsh on the boy. His mother adores him, of course, but to the public eye, it appears to be a lack of trust on his father's part. It will be quite a blow to his pride. Nevertheless, it only reinforces what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on excellent terms."" ""Exactly, exactly,"" said M. Hautet. ""We may need to reassess our assumptions on several fronts. We have, of course, sent a cable to Santiago and are awaiting a response. Once we hear back, everything should become clear. On the other hand, if your theory of blackmail is correct, Madame Daubreuil should be able to provide valuable insights."" Poirot interjected: ""M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, how long had he been in M. Renauld's employ?"" ""Over a year?"" ""Do you know if he has ever been to South America?"" ""I am certain he has not. Before joining Mr. Renauld, he worked for many years with some individuals in Gloucestershire whom I am familiar with."" ""So, you can vouch for him being beyond suspicion?"" ""Absolutely."" Poirot seemed disappointed. Meanwhile, the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. ""My regards to Madame Renauld, and I would like to speak to her briefly. Assure her that she does not need to trouble herself. I will come to her upstairs."" Marchaud saluted and left. We waited for a few minutes, and then, to our surprise, Mrs. Renauld, looking ashen in her mourning attire, entered the room. M. Hautet offered her a chair, expressing his apologies, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor held one of her hands in his, showing sympathy without words. Mrs. Renauld addressed M. Hautet. ""You wished to inquire about something, M. le juge."" ""With your permission, madame. I understand that your husband was originally from French Canada. Can you tell me anything about his youth or upbringing?"" She shook her head. ""My husband was always very reserved about his past, sir. I know he came from the Northwest, but I have a feeling that his childhood was not pleasant, as he never spoke of that time. Our life was focused on the present and the future."" ""Was there any mystery in his past?"" Mrs. Renauld smiled slightly and shook her head. ""I am sure there was nothing as dramatic, M. le juge."" M. Hautet also smiled. ""Indeed, we must avoid being melodramatic. There is one more thing,"" he hesitated. Stonor interjected eagerly: ""They have a preposterous notion, Mrs. Renauld. They actually believe that Mr. Renauld was engaged in a relationship with a Madame Daubreuil, who, it seems, lives next door."" A flush of scarlet spread across Mrs. Renauld's cheeks. She lifted her head defiantly, then bit her lip, her face trembling. Stonor gazed at her in surprise, while M. Bex leaned forward and asked gently: ""We regret causing you distress, madame, but do you have any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband's lover?"" With a cry of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her body shook with sobs. Finally, she raised her head and said brokenly: ""It is possible."" The look of utter shock on Stonor's face was unlike anything I had ever seen in my life.",1
"Engrossed, I found myself slightly uplifted. My focus shifted to the passengers. A woman caught my eye. Around thirty years old, of average height, she had a round face with dimples and striking blue eyes. Her attire, while simple, exuded a certain Parisian elegance. There was a subtle air of authority as she effortlessly commanded the deck stewards. She had a designated deck-chair, along with a never-ending stack of cushions. Despite changing her mind multiple times on its placement, she maintained her allure and grace.",1
"The officer and the small man were walking across the street when they spotted me. The man pointed me out to the officer excitedly. Without hesitation, I sprinted away, underestimating the officer's speed. As I ran down Adderly Street, I could feel the eyes of the onlookers on me, anticipating someone to intervene. Desperation set in, and I blurted out, “Where's the station?” Gasping for air, I followed the directions and dashed towards it, hoping to catch a train. Suddenly, I heard rapid footsteps approaching from behind. To my dismay, the little man with the prominent nose was right on my tail, proving to be a remarkable sprinter.",1
"We took a taxi to an address in St. John’s Wood. I was in the dark about our destination, not wanting to ask Poirot in front of our captive. We arrived at a small house where Poirot demanded to see a doctor for his ill wife. The man at the door refused, but Poirot was not deterred. After a scuffle, we all ended up inside the house, the door bolted behind us. Poirot led us into a room, instructing the Italian to hide behind a curtain just as a woman entered. She demanded to know where her husband was, only to be met by Poirot's cryptic words. The Italian emerged from hiding, wielding a revolver, causing the woman to scream and attempt to flee, only to be blocked by Poirot.",1

He points out the importance of the wristwatch gaining two hours after the tragedy and the absence of footprints in the flower bed, alluding to a deeper mystery.

"“Allow me to introduce Captain Lucien Bex, a dear friend from England,” Poirot gestured. The commissary and I exchanged nods before Bex redirected his attention to Poirot. “It has been quite some time, my old friend. Last I saw you was in Ostend back in 1909. I heard you had left the Force?” Poirot confirmed, “Indeed, I now operate a private business in London.” Bex inquired, “You mentioned having information that could be of help to us?” Poirot responded, “It is possible you are already aware. Did you know the victim had summoned me?” Bex was taken aback, “No, by whose request?” Poirot explained, “The deceased. He had foreseen an attempt on his life. Regrettably, he reached out to me too late.” The commissary interjected, “Sacri tonnerre!”",1
"""If I ever said I did, I lied. No, but there’s one person on board who’s known all along. He’s only got to speak and my number’s up. All the same, I’m taking a sporting chance that he won’t speak.” “Why?” “Because he’s a man who likes playing a lone hand. And when the police have got me I should be of no further use to him. Free, I might be! Well, an hour will show.” He laughed rather mockingly, but I saw his face harden. If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps going out of my life. I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours. Not till I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the ridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe freely once more. No arrest had been made, and I realized that it was a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined Suzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the hotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson. It was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought of Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the sure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight. Suzanne was not nearly so enthusiastic. She has travelled a great deal of course. Besides, she is not the type that gets excited before breakfast. She snubbed me severely when I let out an enthusiastic yelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus. By the way, I should like to make it clear here and now that this story will not be a story of South Africa. I guarantee no genuine local colour you know the sort of thing half a dozen words in italics on every page. I admire it very much, but I can’t do it. In South Sea Islands, of course, you make an immediate reference to bêche-de-mer. I don’t know what bêche-de-mer is, I never have known, I probably never shall know. I’ve guessed once or twice and guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to talk about a stoep_ I do know what a stoep is it’s the thing round a house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you call it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw. I had always vaguely associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong that is a lava-lava. At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England.""",1
"With a forceful shove, Poirot sent him tumbling down the stairs. In a matter of moments, all three of us found ourselves indoors, the door swiftly closed and secured. ""This way, quickly."" Poirot gestured towards the nearest room, flicking on the light. ""And you, hide behind the drapes."" ""Yes, sir,"" replied the Italian, vanishing behind the rich rose-coloured velvet that adorned the window alcove. Just in time. A moment later, a woman burst into the room. Tall and fiery-haired, she clutched a scarlet robe tightly around her figure. ""Where is my husband?"" she demanded, casting a fearful glance around the room.",1
"I had survived multiple attempts on my life by him, witnessed him murder an innocent woman, and was aware of his involvement in numerous other crimes unbeknownst to me. Despite this knowledge, I couldn't bring myself to fully comprehend the gravity of his actions. He remained in my eyes as a charming and affable companion on our travels. Strangely, I couldn't muster any fear towards him, despite knowing his capacity to order my execution without hesitation. The only comparison I could draw was to Stevenson's infamous character, Long John Silver.",1
"""The situation was undeniably perplexing. Although it was evident that the woman herself was not the perpetrator of the crime, as Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall when the gunshot rang out, there was undoubtedly a connection to the murder, given her sudden decision to flee. I immediately sent a message to Poirot and proposed heading back to London to investigate at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s response came swiftly: “No point in checking at the agency, they won’t have any information on her. Discover which vehicle transported her to hunters lodge upon her initial arrival.”""",1
"Dust was scattered about conspicuously, catching my sensitive friend's attention as he traced his finger along a rectangular mark on a nearby table. ""The service here is less than satisfactory,"" he remarked wryly. Lost in thought, he gazed out of the window, lost in contemplation. ""Well?"" I pressed, my impatience growing. ""Why did we even come here?"" His response was delayed. ""Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wanted to verify if the door was truly bolted on this side as well."" ""Well,"" I replied, glancing at the door leading to the previous room, ""it is indeed bolted."" Poirot simply nodded.",1
"Mrs. Blair has been cooperating with us since the beginning. I got the note dictated by you, it was just as I anticipated. Race and I had already talked about the possibility of a hidden passage in the curio shop, and he had found where the exit was located.” Suddenly, there was a loud ripping noise, followed by a powerful blast that reverberated through the room. “They're bombing this part of the city. I need to get you out of here, Anne.” A sudden burst of light illuminated the scene as the house across the street went up in flames. Sir Eustace stood up and began pacing back and forth. Harry aimed the gun at him, keeping him in check. “It's over, Sir Eustace, the jig is up.”",1
"The young woman is quite astute. Single-handedly, it seems, she has uncovered the true identity of the deceased woman found in my residence. The victim was a Russian performer named Nadina. When I inquired with Anne Beddingfeld about the accuracy of this information, she claimed it was a deduction in the style of Sherlock Holmes. Nevertheless, it appears she has already sent this information to Nasby as an established fact. Women possess these instincts, and I am confident that Anne Beddingfeld's assumption is correct, although labeling it a deduction is preposterous. How she secured a position at the Daily Budget is beyond my comprehension.",1
"""But what about the crime of passion? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s lover, and felt that his love for her was fading, or if her jealousy was triggered in any way, might she have impulsively attacked him in a fit of rage?"" Poirot disagreed. ""If we assume that Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not yet grown tired of her. Moreover, you are mistaken about her character. She can feign intense emotional distress. She is a skilled actress. However, if we analyze her life objectively, it contradicts her appearance. Overall, she has been methodical and calculating in her motives and actions. She did not conspire to kill her husband to be with her young lover. Her real target was the wealthy American, whom she likely did not care much about. If she were to commit a crime, it would always be for personal gain. In this case, there was no gain. Furthermore, how do you explain the digging of the grave? That required physical strength."" ""She may have had help,"" I proposed, unwilling to let go of my theory. ""Let me address another objection. You mentioned the resemblance between the two crimes. In what way are they similar, my friend?"" I looked at him in surprise. ""Poirot, it was you who pointed that out! The story of the masked men, the 'secret,' the documents!"" Poirot smiled faintly. ""Do not be so upset, please. I stand by my observations. The similarity between the two narratives inevitably connects the two cases. But consider something very peculiar. It was not Madame Daubreuil who recounted this story if she had, everything would be clear it was Madame Renauld. Is she then working with the other woman?"" ""I cannot believe that,"" I said slowly. ""If that were true, she would be the most skilled actress in history."" ""Oh, please,"" Poirot said impatiently. ""Once again, you are relying on emotion, not logic! If a criminal must be an exceptional actress, then assume she is one. But is it necessary? I do not think Madame Renauld is collaborating with Madame Daubreuil for numerous reasons, some of which I have already outlined to you. The rest are self-evident. Therefore, with that possibility ruled out, we are closing in on the truth, which, as always, is intriguing and enigmatic."" ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""what else do you know?"" ""My friend, you must draw your own conclusions. You have access to the facts! Engage your intellect. Think not like Giraud, but like Hercule Poirot."" ""But are you certain?"" ""In many ways, I have been foolish. But now I see clearly."" ""You know everything?"" ""I have uncovered what M. Renauld wanted me to uncover."" ""And you know who the killer is?"" ""I am aware of one killer."" ""What do you mean?"" ""We are talking at cross-purposes. There are not one but two crimes here. The first I have solved, the second well, I must confess, I am uncertain!"" ""But, Poirot, didn't you say the man in the shed died of natural causes?"" ""Oh, please."" Poirot expressed his impatience. ""You still do not understand. One crime can exist without a murderer, but for two crimes, there must be two bodies."" His statement struck me as particularly unclear, so I regarded him with some concern. However, he seemed perfectly composed. Suddenly, he got up and walked to the window. ""Here he is,"" he stated. ""Who?"" ""M. Jack Renauld. I sent a message to the Villa asking him to come here."" This shifted my thoughts, and I inquired if Poirot knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my clever friend off guard, but as usual, he was well-informed. He had also made inquiries at the station. ""And no doubt we are not the first to think of it, Hastings. The admirable Giraud has probably done the same."" ""You don't think "" I began, then stopped. ""Ah, no, it would be too dreadful!"" Poirot looked at me questioningly, but I said nothing more. It had just occurred to me that out of the seven women connected to the case directly or indirectly Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants only one man was present Jack Renauld. And a man would have had to dig a grave.… I did not have time to explore further the horrifying thought that had crossed my mind, as Jack Renauld entered the room. Poirot greeted him professionally. ""Please, take a seat, sir. I regret causing you any inconvenience, but you may understand that the atmosphere at the Villa is not favorable to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye on everything. His treatment of me has not been particularly polite, and you will understand that I do not want any information I uncover to benefit him in any way."" ""Exactly, M. Poirot,"" the young man replied. ""That fellow Giraud is a disagreeable fellow, and I would be pleased to see someone outsmart him."" ""Then may I ask a favor of you?"" ""Of course."" ""I would like you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station, Abbalac. Inquire at the cloak-room whether two foreigners left a suitcase there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are likely to remember. Would you do this?"" ""Certainly,"" the young man agreed, puzzled but willing to help. ""My colleague and I have other matters to attend to,"" Poirot explained. ""There is a train departing in fifteen minutes, and I would prefer if you did not return to the Villa, as I do not want Giraud to suspect your mission."" ""Very well, I will go directly to the station."" As he stood up, Poirot's voice stopped him. ""One moment, M. Renauld, there is one issue that perplexes me.""",1
"""I don't have cash on hand,"" Papa appeared frustrated. ""My dear, I don't want to deal with these money matters. The bank told me yesterday that I have a twenty-seven pound overdraft."" ""That sounds like your overdraft,"" I suggested. ""Oh, I remember! Contact my publishers."" Papa's books were more renowned than profitable. The thought of traveling to Rhodesia excited me. ""Serious men,"" I whispered in delight. Suddenly, something about my father's look seemed off. ""You're wearing mismatched boots, papa,"" I pointed out.",1
"""I wonder where his plan to deceive me will lead? A woman's hair, hmm!"" The meal was satisfying, yet Poirot seemed preoccupied and distant. Later, in our room, I pressed him to share details of his enigmatic trip to Paris. ""Of course, mon ami. I journeyed to Paris for this."" He produced a faded newspaper clipping from his pocket, displaying a woman's photograph. I gasped. ""You know her, my friend?"" I nodded, recognizing the unmistakable likeness despite the dated style of the photo.",1
"The clever heroine always found herself in the clutches of the Master Criminal, facing death in unusual ways. Fortunately, the hero always came to her rescue just in time. One day, Papa was in a frenzy over the discovery of an ancient skull. He insisted on an immediate trip to explore the area, despite financial concerns. Papa's focus on science clashed with practical matters, leaving Anne to sort out the details. The prospect of an adventure in Rhodesia excited Anne, but she couldn't help noticing her father's mismatched boots.",1
"In all of France, there exists only one individual who can identify him. This fact represents a lucrative opportunity for Madame Daubreuil, one that she exploits without hesitation. She holds complete power over him and extracts a significant amount of money from him. Eventually, the expected outcome occurs. Jack Renauld develops feelings for the lovely young lady he encounters regularly and desires to wed her. This decision sparks a reaction from his father, who is determined to stop his son from marrying the offspring of this wicked woman. While Jack Renauld remains unaware of his father's history, Madame Renauld possesses full knowledge of the past.",1
"I wasn’t a fan of the plan. I preferred to work alone. “That’s settled,” Suzanne said, rising and stretching with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted from talking so much. Now, let’s talk about our targets. Mr. Chichester is headed to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then to Rhodesia. He’s getting a private car on the railway, and after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a spot in it. He probably didn’t mean it, but he can’t back out now.” “Good,” I agreed. “You watch Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I’ll handle Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne gave me a strange look. “Anne, you can’t possibly think” “I do. I suspect everyone. I’m looking for the most unlikely person.” “Colonel Race is also going to Rhodesia,” Suzanne said thoughtfully. “If we could get Sir Eustace to invite him as well” “You can make it happen. You can do anything.” “I love butter,” Suzanne purred. We agreed that Suzanne would use her skills to the fullest. I was too excited to go to bed. It was my final night on the ship. Tomorrow morning we would reach Table Bay. I went up on deck. The breeze was cool, the boat was swaying in the sea. The dark, empty decks were peaceful. It was past midnight. I leaned over the rail, watching the glowing foam. Africa lay ahead, and we were moving towards it in the dark water. I felt alone in a beautiful world, lost in a dream. Suddenly, I sensed danger. I hadn’t heard anything, but I turned and saw a shadowy figure behind me. Before I could react, he attacked. I fought back, but he was strong. Just as I was losing hope, another figure appeared and knocked down my attacker. I was shaken but safe. The man who saved me was the one with the scar. The fallen attacker quickly got up and ran. Rayburn chased after him. I joined the pursuit. They found him collapsed by the door. It was Guy Pagett. Rayburn was shocked. I felt a sense of superiority. “You seem surprised,” I said. “I am,” he replied. He turned to me suspiciously. “Where do you fit in? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A lot, Mr. Lucas.” He grabbed my arm, his grip strong. “Where did you get that name?” he asked. “Isn’t it yours?” I asked sweetly. That surprised him. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he muttered. “I’m a friend,” I said. “I offered to help once, I offer again. Will you accept?” His answer was fierce. “No. I want nothing to do with you or any woman. Do your worst.” My temper flared. “You don’t realize how much power I have over you. A word to the Captain” “Say it,” he sneered. Then, grabbing my throat: “Do you realize you’re in my power now? I could squeeze the life out of you and feed you to the sharks. What do you say?” I said nothing. I laughed, despite the real danger.",1
"I followed him willingly as we approached the Mansions, a stately group of buildings meticulously maintained. A porter, adorned in uniform, was basking in the sunlight at the entrance. Poirot inquired of him: ""Excuse me, do Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?"" The porter, a curt man with a hint of suspicion, barely glanced in our direction and replied gruffly: ""No. 4. Second floor."" ""Thank you. And may I ask how long they have been living here?"" ""Six months."" Shocked, I took a step forward, only to be met with Poirot's sly smile. ""That can't be right,"" I protested. ""You must be mistaken.""",1
"The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I thought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as ever, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor. The detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion. “You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about the case. Let’s hear your views.” “One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M. Giraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there nothing it reminds you of?” “Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so, though.” “You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember but I shall do so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or less.” “There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate say a case of burglary can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.” “And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue a psychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “Eh bien, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.”",1
"Poirot and I arrived at Marsdon Manor to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had recently insured his life for a large sum of money. The circumstances surrounding his death were suspicious, as he was found with signs of internal hemorrhage and financial troubles. Dr. Bernard, the local doctor, provided us with some information but seemed vague and unhelpful. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was distraught and beautiful, and Poirot handled the delicate situation with his usual tact and charm. Our investigation led to more questions than answers, and as we were leaving, a tall young man approached us.",1
"No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",1
"He quickly disposes of her and then proceeds to his task. Leaving the front door open slightly to create a misleading trail for the assassins, he secures Madame Renauld, ensuring she is unable to raise suspicion. The night air is cold as he covers his underclothes with an overcoat, planning to dispose of it along with the deceased. Carefully smoothing over the flower bed, he exits through the window, leaving incriminating evidence behind. As he ventures out onto the desolate golf course, he digs a grave and then...",1
"""You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you will show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “Please there’s a dear.” I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again. Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” ""Wait a minute."" I arrested her eager advance. ""I won't stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You've seen the grave, and the grounds, and you've heard all the details of the affair. Isn't that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant."" She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. ""Me for the horrors,"" she said. ""Come along."" In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl's lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. ""You see,"" I said, ""he was stabbed in the back."" Her voice was almost soundless. ""With what?"" I nodded towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. ""You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you."" ""Water,"" she murmured. ""Quick. Water.…"" I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. ""Take me out of here oh, quickly, quickly!"" she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. ""That's better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?"" I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile. Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. ""I did my best to stop you, you know,"" I said gently. ""I suppose you did. Well, good-bye."" ""Look here, you can't start off like that all alone. You're not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville."" ""Nonsense. I'm quite all right now."" ""Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you."" But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. ""Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me."" ""Are you sure you're all right now?"" ""Quite, thanks. I hope you won't get into any trouble over showing me things?"" I disclaimed the idea lightly. ""Well, good-bye."" ""Au revoir,"" I corrected. ""If you're staying here, we shall meet again."" She flashed a smile at me. ""That's so. Au revoir, then."" ""Wait a second, you haven't told me your address?"" ""Oh, I'm staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It's a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow."" ""I will,"" I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary empressement. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed. Fortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the sergent de ville. And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key kept? Parbleu, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of value to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of assassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse’s time. M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man withdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “Pardon M. Hautet,” I cried, “but will you permit me to ask him one question?” “But certainly, monsieur.” Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. “Where do you keep your boots?” “Sac à papier!” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?” “But when you go to bed at night?” “Under my bed.” “But who cleans them?” “Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise !” he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. “Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and ” “You will not have to send far, M. le juge.” The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window. He leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table. “Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner.” “Not at all. Not at all,” said the magistrate, rather confused. “Of course I am only a detective,” continued the other. “I know nothing of interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do so without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.… But no matter.” M. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously, the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offence. “Eh bien, M. Giraud,” said the magistrate rather sharply. “Without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names of the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where they find themselves now?” Unmoved by this irony, Giraud replied: “I know at least where they have come from.” “Comment?” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things. That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly ” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.” “You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile. “But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping.” “Who is that?” “Madame Daubreuil,” said the detective dryly. “Eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have heard about that, have you?” “I hear everything,” said Giraud imperturbably. “There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,” said M. Hautet, delighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado, he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He also touched on the cheque made out to “Duveen,” and finally handed Giraud the letter signed “Bella.” Giraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then handed it back. “All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected.” “And your theory is?” “For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations.” “Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.” “Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.” Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: “I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.” We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment.",1
"I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown. “Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse. “Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.” There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks. “You know?” she gasped. “How?” I smiled. “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters” “Miss Marvell? She has been here?” “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?” For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile. “That is so,” she acknowledged. “Were yours, too, left by hand by a Chinaman?” “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?” I recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened attentively. “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them something in the nature of joss-stick that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?” I shook my head. “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.” “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.” We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose. “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.” She hesitated, her hand outstretched. “Captain Hastings.” “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.” When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent. I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend. “Bien!” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves. “Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly 10th viscount, served South African War’ tout ça n’a pas d’importance ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ um, um, um, ‘has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. Clubs residences.’ Voilà, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this milord!” “What?” “Yes. I telegraphed to him.” “I thought you had washed your hands of the case?” “I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.” “And you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience. He won’t be pleased.” “Au contraire, if I preserve for him his family diamond, he ought to be very grateful.” “Then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?” I asked eagerly. “Almost a certainty,” replied Poirot placidly. “Everything points that way.” “But how” Poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand. “Not now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that ‘Peerage’ how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, method, which, as I have often told you, Hastings” “Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place. Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality. “Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too. What does it all mean?” Poirot handed him the copy of Society Gossip.",1
"I was taken aback by the sudden appearance of the mysterious woman in my compartment. She was young, with a face covered in powder and lips painted an impossibly bright red. Her impudent demeanor and shocking language made me frown, but her infectious laughter soon broke through my reserve. Despite her unconventional behavior, I found myself unable to resist her charm. With a toss of her head, she declared us friends and demanded an apology for her missing sister. I obliged, feeling strangely drawn to this rebellious stranger.",1
"And the moral of the story is that a criminal's lack of originality will be their downfall. They will repeat the same crime in the same way, leading to their inevitable capture. This lack of creativity in criminal behavior is a key clue for detectives like Hercule Poirot. The small details, like a wristwatch gaining two hours or footprints in a flower-bed, can reveal the true identity of the criminal behind the acts. When Gabriel Stonor, the well-travelled secretary, enters the scene, his connections and insights shed new light on the case. His lack of knowledge about certain names and incidents, like Duveen and Bella, only adds to the mystery at hand. The truth is out there, waiting to be uncovered.",1
"""Indeed! Look who’s here! ‘Watch out, criminals! Hercule Poirot is on the case and let me tell you, ladies, he’s a force to be reckoned with! our beloved society detective won’t let you slip away. Wondering why? Because he’s got the flu himself’!” I chuckled. “Well done, Poirot. You’re really making a name for yourself in the public eye. And luckily, you haven’t missed anything important during this period.” “That’s correct. I didn’t feel any regret turning down the few cases that came my way.” Our landlady appeared at the door. “There’s a man downstairs. Insists on speaking with Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain.",1
"""As he gazed at the lifeless body once more, it became evident that the dagger's handle was devoid of any fingerprints, indicating that the culprit had once again donned gloves. The notion struck me, 'Could it be the same killer in both instances?' Giraud's expression remained unreadable. 'Let's focus on the facts. Marchaud!' The sergeant de ville promptly entered the room. 'Yes, Monsieur?' 'Where is Madame Renauld? I summoned her fifteen minutes ago.' 'She and her son are approaching the house, Monsieur.' 'Excellent. I will interrogate them separately.' With a salute, Marchaud exited the room.""",1
"Lord Yardly was shocked to see the diamond known as ""The Star of the East."" Poirot assured him that it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen in order to preserve it. Poirot then revealed that the diamond was originally in the possession of Mr. Rolf, who had been blackmailing Lady Yardly. Rolf had substituted a fake diamond for the real one, and orchestrated a double robbery to cover his tracks. Lady Yardly played her part in the robbery by pretending to be a victim.",1
"I lifted it from the ground. It smelled of old clothes. So did the deceased. But the doctor did not. I realized that the doctor must have removed it from the body. It bore two words and some numbers. ""Let me see it."" Lord Nasby reached out carelessly. ""I think not,"" I replied, smiling. ""It's mine, you see."" ""You're clever. Right to keep it. No qualms about not giving it to the police?"" ""I tried this morning. They didn't think it was related to the Marlow case, so I kept it. Plus, the inspector annoyed me."" ""Short-sighted man. Keep working on this lead. If you find something that's worth publishing, send it to me for a chance. There's always space for talent on the Daily Budget. But you have to prove yourself first. Understand?"" I thanked him and apologized for my tactics. ""No need. I like cheek from a pretty girl. By the way, you said two minutes and it's been three, with interruptions. That's quite impressive for a woman! Must be your scientific background."" I left the building, feeling exhausted. Lord Nasby was becoming tiresome. But I was pleased with how well my plan had worked. Lord Nasby was surprisingly friendly. Now, all that was left was to ""make good,"" as he put it. Once in my room, I examined the paper closely. It held the key to the mystery. What did the numbers signify? Five numbers, with a dot after the first two. ""Seventeen one twenty-two,"" I whispered. That didn't lead to anything. So I added them up. ""One and seven make eight, plus one is nine, plus two is eleven, plus two is thirteen."" Thirteen! A significant number. Was it a warning to stay away? Possibly. But it seemed useless, except as a warning. I doubted that a conspirator would use that method to convey the number thirteen in real life. If they meant thirteen, they would write it as ""13."" I subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The answer was a hundred and fifty-nine. I tried again and got a hundred and forty-nine. These exercises were good practice, but didn't solve the mystery. I left the math behind and focused on the words. Kilmorden Castle. A specific location. Maybe the home of an aristocratic family. Or a picturesque ruin. I leaned towards the buried treasure theory. Numbers often point to treasure. One step right, seven steps left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps. I could figure that out later. The priority was to reach Kilmorden Castle quickly. I gathered reference books and searched diligently, but found no mention of Kilmorden Castle. A setback. There had to be such a place. Why invent a name and write it down? Absurd! Maybe it was a grandiose house with a fabricated name. But that would be difficult to find. I sat back and pondered my next move. Then it hit me. I had to visit the crime scene. The best sleuths always do. And they always find something the police missed, no matter how much time has passed. My plan was clear. I had to go to Marlow. But how to gain access to the house? After discarding risky approaches, I settled on a simple one. The house was for rent, so I would pose as a potential tenant. I focused on local agents with fewer listings. Unfortunately, I didn't find any suitable properties. The clerk mentioned Sir Eustace Pedler's place, The Mill House. ""Where the murder happened,"" he added. ""But maybe you wouldn't want..."" ""Oh, I think I wouldn't mind,"" I said confidently. I felt my credibility was established. ""And perhaps I could get a good deal in these circumstances."" A brilliant move, I thought. ""It's a possibility. It won't be easy to rent now, with servants and all. If you like it, make an offer. Shall I write you a note?"" ""Please do.""",1
"""Isn’t it true that women worship strength, almost like ancestor worship?” “It’s quite true if we’re honest. You may think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, it’s the physical that matters. Living in primitive conditions would make it acceptable, but that’s not the case. In the end, the other side triumphs. The things that seem defeated always prevail in the end, don’t they? They win in the most important way. It’s like what the Bible says about losing your soul and then discovering it.""",1
"With a quick gesture, the woman grabbed a large black velvet cat that was hiding the telephone. ""The documents are hidden in the lining of this,"" she revealed. ""Impressive,"" Poirot whispered admiringly as he stepped away from the door. ""Good evening, madame. I will keep your New York friend occupied while you escape."" ""Idiot!"" shouted the Italian man, raising his gun and firing at the woman as she fled, prompting me to tackle him to the ground.",1
"“Let us enter, sir.” “Do you have our associates unharmed?” “Yes, they are safe. However, they were not in possession of the items.” “I understand. So you have come to conduct a search. I am preparing to leave with Hastings, but before I go, I would like to share some insights on the history and behaviors of the household cat.” “Goodness gracious, have you lost your mind?” “The cat,” Poirot announced, “was revered by the ancient Egyptians. Even today, it is believed to be a sign of good fortune if a black cat crosses your path. Tonight, this cat has crossed your path, Japp. To discuss the inner workings of any creature or individual is, I realize, considered impolite in England.",1
"Poirot hesitated before turning to M. Hautet. ""Let's head there now,"" he said quietly. As we made our way to the scene, I could sense Poirot's determination to uncover the truth behind the murder. However, when he finally spoke, it was with an odd awkwardness that seemed out of place. ""His overcoat was quite long,"" Poirot remarked, his voice strained. M. Hautet greeted us in the hall, and we followed Françoise upstairs. Poirot's erratic movement caught my attention, but he explained in a whisper, ""We must be cautious, the servants are listening.""",1
"Rayburn was taken aback by the sight of Guy Pagett. ""Pagett,"" he mumbled in disbelief. Rayburn seemed shocked by the revelation, but I couldn't help feeling a bit smug. ""You look like you've seen a ghost,"" I remarked. Rayburn's eyes narrowed. ""What's your role in all this? How much have you figured out?"" I flashed a knowing smile. ""Let's just say I know more than you think, Rayburn."" His grip on my arm tightened, his voice trembling as he demanded, ""Where did you hear that name?""",1
"On my instructions, Mrs. Renauld rejected her son and announced her plan to draft a will the following day that would prevent him from inheriting any of his father's wealth. It was a drastic measure, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was willing to take the chance, although she neglected to mention her change of location. I assumed she assumed I was aware. Everything unfolded as predicted. Marthe Daubreuil attempted one final effort to claim the Renauld fortune and was unsuccessful! ""What truly astounds me,"" I remarked, ""is how she managed to enter the premises without detection. It's truly miraculous.",1
"“Pagett is a conniving fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be willing to bet that he’ll choose some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too, I forgot to mention that.” Suzanne clutched my hand excitedly and nearly dragged me to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we must quickly make plans. Pagett is staying behind, did you hear that?” “Yes. I suppose that means I won’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia, which is quite annoying because I want to go. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going for sure. I don’t see how you could back out without it seeming suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might be suddenly summoned by Sir Eustace, making it harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I’d have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly natural. Besides, we mustn’t completely forget about the other two.” “Oh, Anne, you can’t seriously suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everyone,” I said darkly. “And if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you would know it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted. “I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house.” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll keep an eye on him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It feels like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve been imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem real at all. If Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humor always deserts her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion seriously. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes sparkled at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race.”",1

"""I suggest you adjust your attitude, young lady."" I remained silent, letting out a small yawn that hinted at my boredom. ""What the heck,"" he started forcefully. But I cut him off. ""Yelling won't get you anywhere with me. Let's not waste time. I have no interest in speaking with subordinates. Take me directly to Sir Eustace Pedler to save us both time and trouble."" ""To?""

"He paused for a moment, deep in thought, before rising abruptly. “You’re heading back to Yardly Chase right away? Very well! Don’t breathe a word to anyone except to expect us there this evening. We’ll be there just after five.” “Okay, but I don’t understand” “It doesn’t matter,” said Poirot kindly. “You want me to keep your diamond safe, right?” “Yes, but” “Then do as I say.” A confused nobleman left the room. We arrived at Yardly Chase at half-past five, following the butler to the grand hall with a roaring fire. Lady Yardly and her children were there, the mother’s head bent over her two kids. Lord Yardly stood nearby, smiling. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler. Lady Yardly looked surprised, her husband turned to Poirot for guidance. “I apologize! I’m still investigating Miss Marvell’s case. She’s coming on Friday, isn’t she? I wanted to check everything first. Lady Yardly, do you remember the postmarks on the letters you received?” Lady Yardly shook her head. “I’m sorry, I don’t. I never thought they were serious.” “Will you be staying the night?” Lord Yardly asked. “Oh, my lord, I don’t want to inconvenience you. Our bags are at the inn.” “No trouble at all. We’ll have them sent for. Please stay.” Poirot agreed, sitting with Lady Yardly and playing with the children. As they played, Lady Yardly expressed her love for her children. “You’re a good mother,” said Poirot, bowing. A dressing-gong rang, and we prepared to go to our rooms. Just then, a telegram arrived for Lord Yardly, causing a stir. Lady Yardly expressed her reluctance for him to sell the family diamond. She left to get ready. Later, we gathered in the drawing-room, awaiting Lady Yardly’s appearance. When she entered, the lights suddenly went out, a door slammed, and a woman’s scream pierced the silence. Lord Yardly panicked, rushing towards the noise. We found Lady Yardly on the floor, unconscious, her necklace missing. “The Chinaman,” she whispered. “The Chinaman by the side door.” Lord Yardly dashed towards the mentioned door, finding the stolen necklace just outside. The missing diamond, the Star of the East, was gone. “This confirms it,” I said. “These were not ordinary thieves. They only wanted one stone.” “But how did they get in?” “Through this door.” “But it’s always locked.” I opened it easily, revealing a torn piece of silk, likely from a Chinaman’s robe. We searched in vain, the thief had escaped. The police were called, and Lady Yardly recovered enough to tell her story. The diamond of Miss Marvell had also been stolen that morning, confirming my fears. Poirot, realizing his mistake, decided to return the stolen diamond and solve the case. Lord Yardly was shocked but grateful, as Poirot revealed the truth behind the theft. The ingenious scheme had fooled everyone, but Poirot’s sharp mind had uncovered the deception.",1
"I have always been inclined to view work as something that should be taken on with a light and airy touch, if at all! Guy Pagett, on the other hand, is a man of seriousness and dedication. His lack of frivolity makes him a challenging companion. When I suggested he go to Florence, he eagerly accepted, despite the unusual timing. His devotion to guidebooks and galleries made it a worthwhile investment for me. However, our peace was shattered when he informed me of a murder in my house, involving a foreign woman. This unexpected turn of events has led me to reconsider my plans and embark on a new journey.",1
"Poirot calmly analyzed the situation as Japp burst in with a sense of urgency. There was a burglary, jewels and money involved, and the culprit seemed to have made a clever escape plan. Poirot, with his keen eye for detail, explained his theory while enjoying his breakfast. Japp pressed for answers on the whereabouts of the criminal. Poirot, unfazed, hinted at a hiding place that showcased the brilliance of the criminal mind. The conversation turned to the best escape strategy, with Poirot's companions offering their opinions.",1
"He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.” “You don’t think ” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too horrible!” Poirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants there was, with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one man Jack Renauld. And a man must have dug a grave.… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad. “That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot. “There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you not to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an inkling of your errand.” “Very well, I will go straight to the station.” He rose to his feet. Poirot’s voice stopped him. “One moment, M. Renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me. Why did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack Renauld’s face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself. “You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining magistrate this morning.” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my unchanging devotion.” “And you did see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face. There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, mon ami, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go up to the Villa Geneviève.” “By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road, “I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.” Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me. “And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired. Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.” “Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s only that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself all right.” Poirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked himself. Arrived at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered. He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! Un moment, s’il vous plaît.” I joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly startled, came running up to the hedge at his call. “A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?” “Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.” Despite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid. “Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast. “Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M. Jack Renauld.” “What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?” “Giraud.” “Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will he will ” She broke off. There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently. “You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment maman called me from the house, and I had to go. That is all, only I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.’ Now, Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not see Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?” “Surely, Poirot,” I cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like that would murder his own father.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe anything.” “And the motive?” “Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come in to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.” “But the tramp. Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.” “And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.” “Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack. “He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, jeune homme?” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said. I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud.",1
"""Poirot's comments on the underexposed interiors were unnecessary, showing his jealousy of my position on the case. His request for clothing details seemed ridiculous, but I complied. When Poirot advised Japp to arrest the housekeeper, it was too late. Mrs. Middleton had vanished, leaving behind only ordinary clothes. Mrs. Havering hired her from Selbourne's Agency, but they had no record of her. The mystery deepened as we realized she must have had a connection to the murder. Poirot instructed us to find out what vehicle took her to Hunter's Lodge. The local garage had no record of her using their services. Mrs. Havering had given her money for transportation, but none of the available options were used.""",1
"Arriving at the scene of the crime, I wasted no time in inspecting the room where the tragedy had occurred. The room was plain, with white walls and a bare floor stained around the edges. Despite my thorough search, I found nothing of interest except for a peculiar discovery hidden in a cupboard under one of the windows. A roll of Kodak films, smelling strongly of moth balls, was nestled in the corner. This unexpected find provided a crucial clue to the murder mystery, leading me to believe that the films had been dropped by the mysterious ""doctor"" during a struggle with the woman. Determined to unravel the truth, I left the house with the films in hand, eager to have them developed and delve deeper into the investigation.",1
"""I felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot. 'Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer needed.' Once outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise, he remarked: 'I should rather like to see the room next door.' The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a large double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably, and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window. 'The service leaves to be desired,' he observed dryly. He was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have fallen into a brown study. 'Well?' I demanded impatiently. 'What did we come in here for?' He started. 'Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also.' 'Well,' I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left, 'it is bolted.' Poirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking. 'And, anyway,' I continued, 'what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you'd had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn't go wrong over.' Poirot shook his head. 'The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.' 'But the maid did!' 'Why do you say that?' 'Why,' I stammered, 'they were found actually in her mattress.' 'Ta, ta, ta!' said Poirot impatiently. 'Those were not the pearls.' 'What?' 'Imitation, mon ami.' The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. 'The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!' 'Come!' I cried, dragging at his arm. 'Where?' 'We must tell the Opalsens at once.' 'I think not.' 'But that poor woman' 'Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.' 'But the thief may escape with them!' 'As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?' 'Oh!' I said, bewildered. 'Exactly,' said Poirot, beaming. 'We start again.' He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness. 'Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen's room.' The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen's room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife's room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered. As she was about to depart Poirot detained her. 'One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen a card like this?' He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully. 'No, sir, I can't say I have. But, anyway, the valet has most to do with the gentlemen's rooms.' 'I see. Thank you.' Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head. 'Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the valet.' I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents. In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen's belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot's thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again: 'And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .' 'Poirot,' I cried, 'I see' 'You see nothing, my friend,' he replied quickly. 'As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments.' We did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot effected a rapid change of clothing. 'I go to London to-night,' he explained. 'It is imperative.' 'What?' 'Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!' 'You'll come a cropper one of these days,' I observed, rather disgusted by his vanity. 'Do not be enraged, I beg of you, mon ami. I count on you to do me a service of your friendship.' 'Of course,' I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. 'What is it?' 'The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?' 'No, I didn't.' 'You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore false to all my principles.' 'But what was the powder?' I asked, not particularly interested in Poirot's principles. 'Not the poison of the Borgias,' replied Poirot, with a twinkle. 'I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk.' 'French chalk?' 'Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.' I laughed. 'You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something exciting.' 'Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!' The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush. The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel. In the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us, and it was past eight when I got back to the Grand Metropolitan. The first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more diminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in a state of placid satisfaction. 'Mon ami Hastings!' he cried, and sprang to meet me. 'Embrace me, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!' Luckily, the embrace was merely figurative not a thing one is always sure of with Poirot. 'Do you mean' I began. 'Just wonderful, I call it!' said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over her fat face. 'Didn't I tell you, Ed, that if he couldn't get back my pearls nobody would?' 'You did, my dear, you did. And you were right.' I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance. 'My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.' 'Ended?' 'But yes. They are arrested.' 'Who are arrested?' 'The chambermaid and the valet, parbleu! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?' 'You said cabinet-makers used it.' 'Certainly they do to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot. 'Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. Célestine leaves the room again, and pst! in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer. 'Madame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl's bed that morning by the chambermaid a master stroke, ça!' 'But what did you go to London for?' 'You remember the card?' 'Certainly. It puzzled me and puzzles me still. I thought' I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. 'Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints. I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been 'wanted' for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet's possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method' 'At least thirty-six thousand times!' I interrupted. 'But where did their 'method' break down?' 'Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark' 'I remember,' I cried. 'Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!' There was a moment's silence. 'And I've got my pearls,' said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. 'Well,' I said, 'I'd better have some dinner.' Poirot accompanied me. 'This ought to mean kudos for you,' I observed. 'Pas du tout,' replied Poirot tranquilly. 'Japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them. But' he tapped his pocket 'I have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you, my friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we return here next week-end at my expense this time?' Now that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I think I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe. One evening after dinner I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when 'Peace by negotiation' was the parrot-cry of England's enemies my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand. I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England's Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. 'Fighting Mac,' as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England's Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention. 'In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!' He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. 'Anything interesting on?' I inquired, after a minute or two. 'I assist a how do you call it? 'charlady' to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.' I laughed. 'At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.' 'I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate MacAdam?' 'Enfantillage!' replied Poirot promptly. 'One can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.' 'It was very near succeeding this time,' I reminded him. Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him. 'They won't give their names, sir, but they says as it's very important.' 'Let them mount,' said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. 'Monsieur Poirot?' said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. 'My business is private.' 'You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,' said my friend, nodding to me to remain. 'He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.' Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: 'Oh, come on don't let's beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we're in soon enough. Time's everything.' 'Pray be seated, messieurs,' said Poirot politely. 'Will you take the big chair, milord?' Lord Estair started slightly.""",1
"Madame Beroldy was the kind of woman who could captivate any man. Her beauty and mysterious aura drew people in, including the wealthy American, Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. But behind closed doors, a dark and twisted plot was unfolding. One fateful night, the Beroldys' home was breached by masked intruders, leading to a gruesome discovery. Madame Beroldy was found bound and gagged, while her husband lay lifeless with a knife through his heart. The investigation pointed towards Madame Beroldy and her alleged lover, Georges Conneau. Despite her royal blood claims and elaborate stories, the truth eventually came to light when a confession letter from Conneau surfaced, revealing the shocking extent of their deadly plan.",1
"I am certain of Mrs. Renauld's innocence in this case, as her fainting was genuine and her anguish real. She did not need to fake her grief, as she had already shown true emotion upon hearing of her husband's death. The open door at the crime scene puzzled Poirot, who believed that the culprit must have left through the window. This theory was supported by the lack of footprints in one of the flower beds, which had been smoothed over with a rake to erase any trace of the intruder's presence. Despite initial doubts, I began to consider the possibility that the murderer had indeed escaped through the window, opening up a new avenue of investigation.",1
"Ah, it was executed with remarkable precision! After setting the clock to 8.47, he violently smashes it and halts time. The one oversight: he neglects to close the curtains. In a real scenario, the curtains would have been drawn once daylight waned. After swiftly informing the lift operator about the guests, he rushes to a phone booth. At almost precisely 8.47, he calls the doctor with his employer's final plea. His plan is so flawless that there is never any investigation into whether a call was made from Flat II at that exact moment. ""Unless Hercule Poirot decides to meddle,"" I remarked sarcastically.",1
"I despise being entangled in such matters. The day took a turn when Guy Pagett entered my bedroom this morning, holding a telegram with a solemn expression that rivaled a mourner at a funeral. Guy Pagett, my diligent secretary, is an exemplary individual in every aspect - diligent, meticulous, and hard-working. Yet, he manages to irritate me like no other. I have pondered for quite some time on how to remove him from my service. However, it is not feasible to terminate a secretary simply because he prioritizes work over leisure, enjoys rising early, and possesses no discernible vices. The one redeeming quality about him is his somber countenance.",1
"He made a stop at a small cottage hospital to get his wound treated before continuing on to Charing Cross, where a special train was ready to take him to Dover. Captain Daniels provided a brief account of the incident to the police before the man departed for France.

""Although, there is one rather odd detail that I must mention.""",1
"I heard the sound of running feet in the passage. Suddenly, a man burst into my cabin, pleading for help. With quick thinking, I hid him behind my cabin trunk and wash-basin, disguising myself as a lady preparing to wash. A night stewardess interrupted, warning of a drunk man causing trouble. After bandaging the wounded man's stab wound, he refused my help coldly. I felt a sense of danger from him, especially when he refused to thank me for saving his life. The next morning, I discovered someone had searched my cabin. Determined to uncover the truth, I kept a close eye on Sir Eustace Pedler, Mr. Pagett, and the Rev. Edward Chichester. The mysterious events on the ship continued, raising suspicions about the people around me.",1
"""One learns to value life and death with ease.” “Indeed,” I replied, recalling Harry Rayburn. He had shared that sentiment. “But one should not mistreat the vulnerable?” “There are varying opinions on what constitutes ‘vulnerability,’ Miss Anne.” His tone turned serious, catching me off guard. It dawned on me that I had little insight into the man walking beside me. “I was referring to children and animals, perhaps.” “I can assure you I’ve never been unkind to children or animals. Do you consider women as ‘vulnerable’?” I paused. “No, I don’t believe I do, although they may be, I suppose.”",1
"""The woman was talking so quickly that I couldn't quite make out her words, but I caught Monsieur's final statement as he held the door open for her."" She hesitated, and then repeated slowly and painstakingly: ""'Yes yes, but for God's sake go now!'"" ""Yes, yes, but for God's sake go now!"" echoed the judge. He sent Denise away and, after a brief pause for thought, summoned Françoise back. He asked her if she might have been mistaken about the night Madame Daubreuil visited. Françoise, however, remained stubborn. It was definitely the previous night that Madame Daubreuil had come. No doubt about it. Denise just wanted attention, that's all! So she made up this elaborate story about a mysterious lady. Showing off her knowledge of English as well! Maybe Monsieur never even said that sentence in English, and even if he did, it didn't prove anything, since Madame Daubreuil spoke English fluently and usually used that language when talking to Mr. and Mrs. Renauld. ""You see, Mr. Jack, Monsieur's son, was usually here, and he spoke French very poorly."" The judge didn't push the issue. Instead, he asked about the chauffeur, and discovered that just the day before, Mr. Renauld had said he wouldn't be needing the car and that Masters might as well take a break. A puzzled expression began to form between Poirot's eyes. ""What's wrong?"" I whispered. He shook his head impatiently and posed a question: ""Excuse me, Mr. Bex, but could Mr. Renauld drive the car himself?"" The police officer looked at Françoise, and the elderly woman replied immediately: ""No, Monsieur didn't drive himself."" Poirot's frown deepened. ""I wish you would tell me what's bothering you,"" I said irritably. ""Can't you see? In his letter, Mr. Renauld mentioned sending the car for me to Calais."" ""Maybe he meant a rented car,"" I suggested. ""Probably. But why rent a car when you have your own? Why decide yesterday to suddenly send the chauffeur on vacation, with no advance notice? Could it be that he wanted him out of the way for some reason before we arrived?"" Françoise had left the room. The judge was drumming his fingers thoughtfully on the table. ""Mr. Bex,"" he said after a while, ""we have conflicting testimonies here. Who should we trust, Françoise or Denise?"" ""Denise,"" the police officer said firmly. ""She was the one who let the visitor in. Françoise is old and stubborn, and clearly doesn't like Madame Daubreuil. Plus, our own information suggests that Renauld was involved with another woman."" ""Tiens!"" exclaimed Mr. Hautet. ""We forgot to tell Mr. Poirot about that."" He rummaged through the papers on the table and eventually handed the one he was looking for to my friend. ""This letter, Mr. Poirot, was found in the pocket of the deceased's coat."" Poirot took it and unfolded it.",1
"""Once I obtained a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by someone aboard the Kilmorden - either Carton or Rayburn, I wasn't certain. It echoed the piece of paper you found: 'Seventeen one twenty two.' I assumed it was a meeting with Rayburn, and his urgency to board the Kilmorden confirmed my suspicions. I feigned belief in his lies and allowed him access, keeping a close eye on him in hopes of gaining more information. When I discovered Minks trying to interfere, I put a stop to it. He fell in line quickly. Not securing Cabin 17 was frustrating and not being able to identify you troubled me. Were you truly the innocent girl you appeared to be? Rayburn went to the supposed meeting that night, with Minks assigned to intercept him. Minks failed, naturally."" ""But why did the message say 'seventeen' instead of 'seventy-one'?"" ""I've figured that out. Carton must have given the operator his notes to copy onto a form, without verifying the final copy. The operator, like the rest of us, misread it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22. What I can't explain is how Minks found Cabin 17. It must have been pure instinct."" ""And the message to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?"" ""My dear Anne, did you think I'd let my plans be exposed without taking precautions? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no qualms swapping the documents for blanks. No one would suspect poor Pedler."" ""What about Colonel Race?"" ""Yes, that was unexpected. When Pagett revealed he was in Secret Service, I grew uneasy. I remembered his past interest in Nadina during the War and feared he was onto me. His unwavering presence concerns me. He's the type to always have a hidden agenda."" A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened briefly, then replied: ""Very well, I'll see him now."" ""Business,"" he commented. ""Miss Anne, let me show you to your room."" He led me to a modest room, a Kafir boy brought my suitcase, and Sir Eustace, encouraging me to ask for anything I needed, left, the epitome of a gracious host. A can of hot water sat on the washstand, and I began unpacking essentials. A foreign object in my sponge-bag caught my attention. I untied it and found a small pearl-handled revolver. It had not been there when I left Kimberley. I inspected it cautiously. It seemed loaded. I hesitantly tucked it into my stocking - an uncomfortable bulge, but the safest spot. Sir Eustace didn't summon me until late afternoon. I had tea and lunch in my room, preparing for what was to come. Sir Eustace was alone, pacing with a gleam in his eye. There was a shift in his demeanor towards me. ""I've news for you. Your young man is on his way. Be calm, I have more to say. This morning, you tried to deceive me. Stick to the truth - I advised you. You erred by suggesting the diamonds were with Harry Rayburn. In reality, I've had them since leaving the Falls, only discovering it recently."" ""You knew!"" I gasped. ""Pagett inadvertently revealed it. He rambled about a bet and film canisters, leading me to piece it together. I transferred the films before leaving, they're in the corner. I haven't reviewed them, but one feels different, rattles oddly, and is sealed with seccotine, requiring a tin-opener. The truth is clear now, isn't it? You and Rayburn are trapped. Pity you rejected the idea of becoming Lady Pedler."" I stood speechless. Footsteps approached, the door burst open, and Harry Rayburn was brought in. Sir Eustace looked triumphant. ""As planned,"" he murmured. ""Amateurs against professionals."" ""What's going on?"" Harry demanded. ""You've played into my hands,"" Sir Eustace chuckled. ""You were meant to come safely, Anne?"" ""Don't blame her. That note was under my direction, she had no choice.""",1
"As my rescuer turned towards me, a sense of urgency emanated from him. ""You're injured!"" His voice held a hint of danger towards whoever had caused me harm. In that instant, I recognized him - the man with the scar. But before he could react, our fallen adversary had already bolted up and fled. Rayburn cursed as he pursued the enemy, leaving me behind. Feeling left out, I reluctantly joined the pursuit, lagging behind. We raced around the deck, finally reaching the starboard side of the ship.",1
"""You see, Anne, Sir Eustace has been cleared of all charges. His guilt is certain, despite some technicalities. There is nothing to prevent you from being together now."" His voice was hesitant as he spoke, avoiding eye contact. ""I am aware,"" I responded with relief. ""And there is no obstacle to him reclaiming his true identity immediately."" ""Indeed, there is not."" ""Do you know his true name?"" The question caught me off guard. ""Yes, I do. It's Harry Lucas."" His silence in response felt unsettling, leaving me with a sense of unease.",1
"Poirot and I quickly discussed the situation before he hurried away. I patted him on the back, acknowledging his success. ""They've revealed the hiding spot to you, haven't they? But you must send a wire to France immediately. Going in person will be too slow."" Poirot gave me a puzzled look. ""Some things, my friend, cannot be communicated through telegrams."" Just then, Major Norman came back with a Flying Corps officer, Captain Lyall, who would be flying Poirot to France.",1
"""Ridiculous!” “Not at all! Haven't you witnessed impersonators in music halls mimicking famous personalities with uncanny precision? It's a piece of cake to pretend to be someone in the public eye. The Prime Minister of England is a much simpler target to mimic than an average Joe like Mr. John Smith from Clapham. And as for O’Murphy’s doppelgänger, no one would have paid him any attention until after the Prime Minister had left, at which point he would have vanished. He travels from Charing Cross directly to his rendezvous with accomplices. He enters as O’Murphy, and exits as an entirely different person. O’Murphy has vanished into thin air, leaving behind a conveniently suspicious trail.""",1
"“But this is pitch black. I cannot see.” “Poirot,” I exclaimed impatiently, after the Ministers had left, “what are your thoughts?” My friend was meticulously packing a small suitcase, his hands moving swiftly and expertly. With a pensive expression, he shook his head. “I am at a loss. My mind is failing me.” “Why go through the trouble of kidnapping him when a blow to the head would suffice?” I pondered. “Forgive me, my friend, but I did not quite suggest that. It is far more advantageous for them to handle the kidnapping.” “But why?” “Because uncertainty breeds chaos. That is one reason. If the Prime Minister were to be deceased, it would be a tragedy, but a challenge that could be met. However, with his disappearance, there is paralysis. Will he return, or is he gone forever? Is he alive or dead? Nobody knows, and until they find out, nothing concrete can be accomplished. And, as I mentioned, uncertainty leads to chaos, which is precisely what the enemy desires. Furthermore, by keeping the Prime Minister hidden, the kidnappers have the upper hand to negotiate with both sides. The German Government may not be known for their generosity, but in a situation like this, they can be persuaded to pay a hefty sum. Lastly, they avoid the risk of facing the hangman’s noose. Oh, without a doubt, the responsibility of kidnapping lies with them.” “In that case, why attempt to shoot him first?” Poirot expressed his frustration. “Ah, that is the part that baffles me! It is senseless and foolish! They had everything perfectly arranged for the abduction, and yet they jeopardize the entire operation with a dramatic attack, reminiscent of a film, and just as unrealistic. It is nearly inconceivable, with a group of masked individuals, so close to London!” “Perhaps the shooting and the kidnapping were two separate incidents that occurred independently,” I suggested. “Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Furthermore, who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor involved in the initial incident. Was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It had to be one of them, otherwise, why would the car deviate from the main road? We cannot assume that the Prime Minister was complicit in his own demise! Did O’Murphy choose that path on his own, or was it at Daniels’ instruction?” “It seems likely that O’Murphy was responsible.” “Yes, because had it been Daniels, the Prime Minister would have overheard the command and questioned it. However, there are too many unanswered questions in this case, and they contradict each other. If O’Murphy is trustworthy, why divert from the main road? But if he is untrustworthy, why restart the car after just two shots were fired, potentially saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, if he is honest, why drive straight to a known spot for German spies immediately after departing from Charing Cross?” “It does not look favorable,” I remarked. “Let us approach this methodically. What evidence do we have for and against these two men? Let us begin with O’Murphy. Against: his decision to leave the main road was suspicious; he hails from County Clare; he has vanished in a suspicious manner. For: his quick action in restarting the car prevented a tragedy; he is a member of Scotland Yard and, based on his assigned role, a trusted detective. Now, as for Daniels. There is little against him, except his mysterious background and proficiency in multiple languages for an Englishman! (I beg your pardon, my friend, but your linguistic abilities are lacking!) On his behalf, he was discovered gagged, bound, and unconscious, which does not align with him being involved in the plot.” “He could have tied himself up to divert attention,” I suggested. Poirot shook his head. “The French authorities would not overlook such a detail. Besides, once he achieved his objective and the Prime Minister was safely taken, there would be no reason for him to stay behind. His accomplices could have subdued him, but I fail to comprehend their motive. He is of little use to them now, as he will undoubtedly be under close surveillance until the Prime Minister’s situation is resolved.” “Perhaps he aimed to mislead the police?” “Then why did he not do so? He simply claims to have been chloroformed and remembers nothing further. There is no indication of deception. It sounds remarkably truthful.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the clock, “I suppose we should head to the station. You may discover additional clues in France.” “Possibly, my friend, but I am skeptical. It is still incredible to me that the Prime Minister has not been located in that confined area, where concealing him would be a significant challenge. If the forces of two nations have not succeeded in finding him, how can I?” At Charing Cross, Mr. Dodge greeted us. “This is Detective Barnes from Scotland Yard and Major Norman. They are at your service. Best of luck. It’s a dire situation, but I am still hopeful. I must take my leave now.” And with that, the Minister walked away briskly. We engaged in casual conversation with Major Norman. In the midst of the group of men on the platform, I spotted a familiar face conversing with a tall, fair man. It was Detective-Inspector Japp, an old acquaintance of Poirot’s, reputed to be one of Scotland Yard’s brightest officers. He approached us and greeted my friend warmly. “I heard you were involved in this case as well. Impressive work. So far, they have managed to evade capture. But I believe they will not be able to keep him hidden for long. Our teams are scouring France thoroughly. I sense that the end is near, possibly within hours.” “That is, assuming he is still alive,” the tall detective remarked somberly. Japp’s expression turned grim. “Yes.",1
"""It adds up, also, to M. Renauld's effort to appease her with a check. I believe I will be able to locate her easily with the aid of this."" He then revealed the picture he had removed from Jack Renauld's desk. ""With affection from Bella,"" was written in messy handwriting in the corner, but that was not what captured my attention. The quality of the image was not the best, yet it was undeniably familiar to me. A chill ran down my spine, as if a terrible disaster had struck me. It was the visage of Cinderella.",1
"""And yet, attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is just as plausible. Therefore, we must consider the possibility that Madame Renauld lied out of love for the man she cherished, Georges Conneau. Do you agree with that?"" ""Yes,"" I conceded. ""It does make sense."" ""Good! Madame Renauld's affections lie with Georges Conneau. But who is Georges Conneau, really?"" ""The vagrant."" ""Do we have any proof that Madame Renauld loved the vagrant?"" ""No, but..."" ""Exactly. Let go of theories that lack supporting evidence. Instead, ponder on who Madame Renauld truly loved."" I shook my head, puzzled. ""Mais, oui, you already know. Who did Madame Renauld love so deeply that upon seeing his lifeless body, she fainted?"" I gaped in disbelief. ""Her husband?"" I stammered. Poirot nodded. ""Her husband, or Georges Conneau, as you wish to call him."" I collected myself. ""But it's preposterous."" ""How 'preposterous?' Didn't we just agree that Madame Daubreuil could blackmail Georges Conneau?"" ""Yes, but..."" ""And didn't she successfully blackmail Mr. Renauld?"" ""That may be true, but..."" ""And isn’t it a fact that we have no knowledge of Mr. Renauld's past and upbringing? That he suddenly emerges as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?"" ""All of that is true,"" I asserted more confidently, ""but you appear to be overlooking a crucial point."" ""What is it, my friend?"" ""Well, we have acknowledged that Georges Conneau orchestrated the crime. This leads us to the absurd notion that he planned his own demise!"" ""Eh bien, mon ami,"" Poirot said calmly, ""that is precisely what he did!"" In a composed tone, Poirot commenced his explanation. ""You find it odd, my friend, that a man would orchestrate his own death? So peculiar, that you find it easier to dismiss it as fantastical, and revert to a story that is in fact ten times more improbable. Yes, Mr. Renauld plotted his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you he did not intend to die."" I shook my head, bewildered. ""But no, it is all quite simple truly,"" said Poirot kindly. ""For the crime Mr. Renauld envisioned, a murderer was not required, as I mentioned, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, viewing the events from a different perspective this time. ""Georges Conneau flees from justice to Canada. There, under an assumed identity, he weds and eventually amasses a vast fortune in South America. However, he longs for his homeland. Two decades have passed, he is significantly altered in appearance, and has become a man of such prominence that no one would link him to a fugitive from years prior. He deems it safe to return. He establishes himself in England, with plans to spend summers in France. And fate, that enigmatic force that ensures individuals face the consequences of their actions, leads him to Merlinville. There, within all of France, is the sole individual capable of recognizing him. It is, naturally, a goldmine for Madame Daubreuil, and one she wastes no time exploiting. He is at her mercy, entirely. And she extracts a hefty price. ""Then, the inevitable occurs. Jack Renauld falls in love with the captivating woman he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. This alarms his father. At any cost, he will prevent his son from marrying the daughter of this wicked woman. Jack Renauld is unaware of his father's past, but Madame Renauld knows it all. She is a woman of great strength, deeply devoted to her husband. They confer. Renauld sees only one escape from death. He must feign his demise, actually fleeing to a foreign land where he will start anew under a different name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the role of a grieving widow for a time, can join him. It is imperative that she controls the finances, so he revises his will. How they intended to handle the body situation initially, I am unsure perhaps using a skeleton from an art student and a fire, or something of that nature, but long before their plans come to fruition, an incident occurs that aids them. A rough vagrant, aggressive and vulgar, finds his way into the garden. A scuffle ensues, Mr. Renauld tries to remove him, and suddenly the vagrant, an epileptic, collapses in a seizure. He expires. Mr. Renauld summons his wife. Together, they drag him into the shed, where, just outside, the incident transpired, and they recognize the marvelous opportunity that has presented itself. The man bears no resemblance to Mr. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a typical French appearance. That suffices. ""I presume they sat on the bench up there, away from the house, discussing matters. Their plan is swiftly devised. The identification hinges solely on Madame Renauld's testimony. Jack Renauld and the chauffeur (who served his master for two years) must be removed. It is unlikely that the French female servants would approach the body, and in any case, Renauld intends to take precautions to deceive anyone unlikely to discern details. Masters is sent away, a telegram dispatched to Jack, selecting Buenos Ayres to lend credence to the narrative Renauld had devised. Aware of me as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his plea for assistance knowing that, upon my arrival, presenting the letter would deeply affect the examining magistrate, which it indeed did. ""They dress the vagrant's body in one of Mr. Renauld's suits and leave his tattered coat and trousers by the shed's entrance, hesitant to bring them inside. Subsequently, to validate the account Madame Renauld is to provide, they drive the aeroplane dagger through his heart. That evening, Mr. Renauld will bind and silence his wife, and then, armed with a spade, will excavate a grave in that precise area where a how do you say? bunker? is to be constructed. It is crucial that the body is discovered Madame Daubreuil must harbor no suspicions. Nevertheless, if some time passes, the risks of identity being exposed will diminish significantly. Subsequently, Mr. Renauld will don the vagrant's tattered attire, and shuffle to the station, where he will depart, unnoticed, on the 12:10 train.""",1
"Poirot pondered for a moment before speaking, ""The value of the diamond is significant. Greg sold it to you for far less than it is worth."" He paused, deep in thought. ""Hand me my almanac, Hastings,"" he requested. As I handed it to him, Poirot turned the pages, mumbling to himself. ""Ah, the full moon is on Friday next, in three days' time. Madame, I suggest you leave the diamond with me for safekeeping until then. This romantic tale may be a deception, but we cannot be certain. Let us wait until after Friday to decide our next move.""",1
"He was a kind and fatherly man, regarding me as a naive girl facing a harsh world. Despite my efforts to prove otherwise, it seemed futile. In the end, I was left with a mere £87, 17s. 4d. to start a new life. Mr. Flemming proposed I stay with him and his wife in London, a chance I eagerly accepted. As I prepared to leave, I adjusted my appearance to fit the image of an orphan, hoping to make a good impression. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me warmly, though her husband seemed bewildered by my transformation. The day ended with plans for me to seek employment immediately. As I pondered my reflection before bed, I questioned whether my looks truly held any appeal.",1
"He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her. And at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she had a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone. He is a strange man. One doesn’t notice it so much in a crowd. But, when one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do. It was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft yellow brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent except our car which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing about engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be in its interior. By and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders appeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel Race. “There must have been giants once,” I said dreamily. “And their children were just like children are to-day they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long well, it makes one what you would call cruel. One comes to hold life and death very lightly.” “Yes,” I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do though they are, I suppose. That is, they are nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength like lions and tigers” “And giraffes?” interpolated Colonel Race slyly. I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same one feels the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. “Better lift you,” he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture. I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of me, staring into my face. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he said abruptly. “I’m a gipsy seeing the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext. You’ve not the soul of the journalist. You’re out for your own hand snatching at life. But that’s not all.” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I said slowly, “that you are really connected with the Government that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden again. No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of them all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I offered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously. I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it. “Oh,” I cried indignantly, “they’re starved! It’s wicked. Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t don’t,” I said fiercely. “I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not. You see I care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?” “No,” I whispered. “It was since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand and it frightened me. We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. “Alias the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there was something more behind. “You haven’t caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.” “It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves or some one walking over my grave. I keep feeling something dreadful’s going to happen.” “Don’t be silly,” said Suzanne, with decision. “Let’s talk of something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills. I loved it loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there always always. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home. Home! And yet I had never been here before or had I in dreams? We walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely wired against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We went out on the stoep and I uttered a gasp. There, half a mile away, facing us, were the Falls. I’ve never seen anything so grand and beautiful I never shall. “Anne, you’re fey,” said Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch. “I’ve never seen you like this before.” She stared at me curiously. “Am I?” I laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. “It’s just that I love it all.” “It’s more than that.” A little frown creased her brow one of apprehension. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something something that would happen soon. I was excited restless. After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge. It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls their elusive quality. You always think you’re going to see and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.",1
"His expression remained unchanged, a smirk playing on his lips. ""I have my eye on those diamonds,"" he declared. I shook my head. ""You won't be getting your hands on them,"" I retorted. ""Oh, but I will. Let's not beat around the bush. A few bodies turning up in this part of town wouldn't raise any eyebrows. There's a guy downstairs who takes care of those messy situations. Now, let's be reasonable. Write a letter to Harry Rayburn. Tell him to come here, diamonds in tow."" I stood my ground. ""I refuse to comply with your demands.""",1
"""Speaking of apartments,"" she mentioned, ""have you heard the news, Mr. Parker? We finally secured one! At Montagu Mansions."" ""Well,"" Parker responded, ""I've always said there are plenty of apartments at various prices!"" ""Yes, but this one is different. It's incredibly cheap. Eighty pounds per year!"" ""But isn't Montagu Mansions right off Knightsbridge? A grand building. Or are you referring to a lesser version with the same name hidden in the slums somewhere?"" ""No, it's the one in Knightsbridge. That's what makes it so extraordinary."" ""Extraordinary indeed! It's like a miracle. But there must be a catch somewhere. Big deposit, I presume?"" ""No deposit!"" ""No dep oh, help me, somebody!"" groaned Parker. ""But we do need to purchase the furniture,"" Mrs. Robinson added. ""Ah!"" Parker perked up. ""I knew there was a catch!"" ""For fifty pounds. And it's beautifully furnished!"" ""I surrender,"" said Parker. ""The current occupants must be crazy with a penchant for generosity."" Mrs. Robinson seemed a bit concerned. A slight frown appeared between her delicate eyebrows. ""It is strange, isn't it? Do you think that perhaps the place is haunted?"" ""Never heard of a haunted apartment,"" Parker stated firmly. ""N-o."" Mrs. Robinson seemed far from convinced. ""But there were several things about it that struck me as, well, strange."" ""For example,"" I prompted. ""Ah,"" said Parker, ""our expert in crime is intrigued! Tell him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is skilled at unraveling mysteries."" I chuckled, embarrassed but somewhat flattered by the role assigned to me. ""Oh, not truly strange, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time."" Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: ""We thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson she's a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too came hurrying down the stairs. 'Ahead of you for once, my dear,' she said. 'But it’s no good. It’s already let.' That seemed to finish it, but well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium. A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is."" I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied. ""So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in tomorrow!"" Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly. ""And what about Mrs. Ferguson?"" asked Parker. ""Let’s have your deductions, Hastings."" ""'Obvious, my dear Watson,'"" I quoted lightly. ""She went to the wrong flat."" ""Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!"" cried Mrs. Robinson admiringly. I rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities. The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities. ""A curious story,"" he said thoughtfully. ""Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll."" When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke. ""It is as well, mon ami, that we have no affairs of moment on hand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation."" ""What investigation are you talking about?"" ""The remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new flat."" ""Poirot, you are not serious!"" ""I am most serious. Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real rent of those flats is £350. I have just ascertained that from the landlord’s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds! Why?"" ""There must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as Mrs. Robinson suggested."" Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. ""Then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!"" ""But surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution."" ""You may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it, and yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the market when Mrs. Robinson arrived."" ""That shows that there must be something wrong about it."" ""Mrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious, is it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?"" ""She was a delightful creature!"" ""Évidemment! since she renders you incapable of replying to my question. Describe her to me, then."" ""Well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of auburn"" ""Always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!"" murmured Poirot. ""But continue.",1
"""Quietly unlocking the door, he peered out cautiously and let out a loud 'Miaow' before sticking the cat's head through the opening. The Scotland Yard inspector and another man standing outside were startled by the sudden noise. 'Ah, it's just Monsieur Poirot being his usual playful self!' the inspector exclaimed as Poirot's head appeared next to the cat. 'Let us in, monsieur.' 'You have our associates safe?' 'Yes, we have them secured, but they did not have the items on them.' 'Ah, so you've come to search. Before I leave with Hastings, allow me to share some wisdom on the history and behavior of domestic cats.' 'Are you completely out of your mind?' 'The cat,' began Poirot, 'was revered by the ancient Egyptians. It is still considered lucky if a black cat crosses your path. This cat crossed yours tonight, Japp. Speaking of the insides of any living being is not polite, I know, but this cat's interior is quite unique. I'm referring to the lining.' With a sudden movement, the second man snatched the cat from Poirot's grasp. 'Oh, I forgot to introduce you,' Japp said. 'Mr. Poirot, meet Mr. Burt from the United States Secret Service.' The American quickly found what he was looking for. 'Nice to meet you,' said Mr. Burt. 'Perhaps I won't die this time,' Poirot mused optimistically, his words reflecting a hopeful outlook. As the first victim of the flu, I appreciated his positive attitude. Poirot, now recuperating in bed, sipped on a bitter herbal tea while observing a row of medicine bottles on the mantelpiece. 'Yes, soon I shall be back to my usual self, the great Hercule Poirot,' he declared. 'Imagine, mon ami, I even have a mention in Society Gossip. Here it is! 'Hercule Poirot, our beloved society detective, is temporarily out of commission due to illness.' I chuckled. 'You're becoming quite the celebrity, Poirot. You haven't missed much during your recovery.' 'That's true. I didn't regret turning down the few cases that came my way.' Our landlady interrupted, informing us of a visitor downstairs. 'Mr. Roger Havering,' I read from the card she handed me. Poirot gestured towards the bookshelf, and I retrieved 'Who's Who.' After a quick scan, Poirot identified the visitor as the second son of the fifth Baron Windsor. 'Would you like to go speak with him, Hastings?' I volunteered to hear Mr. Havering's concerns in Poirot's absence. Mr. Havering, visibly distressed, urgently requested Poirot's assistance in investigating his uncle's murder. 'I'm sorry, but Poirot is unwell with the flu,' I informed him. Disheartened, Mr. Havering explained the circumstances of the crime that had taken place in Derbyshire. An idea struck me, and I quickly consulted Poirot, who agreed to let me lead the investigation. An hour later, I found myself on a train with Mr. Havering, heading towards Hunter's Lodge in Derbyshire.""",1
"He needed to fake his death, escape to a different country with his wife, and change his identity. To make sure his wife had control of the money, he altered his will. A rough tramp intruded into their garden, leading to an unexpected opportunity for the couple. They quickly devised a plan to shift the blame onto the tramp's body, dressing it in the man's clothes and stabbing it with an aeroplane dagger. The husband would then bury the body, ensuring it was found later to divert suspicion. In the meantime, he would disguise himself as the tramp and quietly leave town. However, their carefully laid out plan faced unexpected challenges when a girl named Bella showed up at their door, threatening to unravel everything.",1

He prepares two wills, has the staff sign both, then confidently presents his will on the back of a crumpled receipt, using a pen filled with his own unique ink.

Should his niece uncover his deception, she will prove her worth and expensive education, earning her rightful claim to his fortune.",1

I longed for romance and adventure, envying Emily's suitors. My only excitement came from daydreams and the Kinema. Yet, a discovery in Rhodesia would soon bring real adventure to my doorstep. Papa was ecstatic about the find, convinced it was the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. We had to leave at once to explore the area for more treasures.",1
"Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the purpose of his visit. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “We don’t want to see Miss Violet deprived of what belongs to her,” declared the woman. “It would be terribly unfair for hospitals to receive everything.” Poirot proceeded with his inquiries. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered distinctly witnessing the will. Baker had been tasked with obtaining two pre-printed will-forms from the nearby town. “Two?” questioned Poirot sharply. “Yes, sir, for precaution, I suppose, in case one is ruined and indeed, that's exactly what happened.”",1
"“Magnificent!” he exclaimed. “May I have a look, madame?” He carefully examined the jewel before handing it back with a slight bow. “An exquisite stone, flawless. Ah, what a gem! And you carry it with you like this!” “No, Monsieur Poirot, I am very cautious. Normally, it is kept in my jewel-case, secured in the hotel safe. We are staying at the Luxurious, you know. I only brought it today for you to admire.”“You will leave it with me, won’t you? You will heed Papa Poirot’s advice?”“Well, you see, Monsieur Poirot, we are heading to Yardly Chase on Friday to visit Lord and Lady Yardly.” This triggered a distant memory. A few years back, scandal surrounded Lord and Lady Yardly during their visit to the States, particularly involving Lady Yardly and a movie star named Gregory B. Rolf.“I’ll share a secret with you, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell continued. “We are in talks with Lord Yardly about filming a play at his estate.”“At Yardly Chase?” I inquired, intrigued. “It's a renowned English landmark.”Miss Marvell confirmed and added, “He is asking for a substantial fee, so it's uncertain if the deal will go through. But Greg and I enjoy mixing business with pleasure.”“Forgive my ignorance, madame, but isn't it possible to visit Yardly Chase without the diamond?” I asked.A sharp look crossed Miss Marvell’s face, betraying her youthful appearance. “I want to wear it there.”“Indeed,” I interjected, “Yardly’s collection includes some famous jewels, including a large diamond, correct?”Miss Marvell simply responded, “That’s right.”Poirot muttered softly, “Ah, that's how it is!” Then, with his usual keen insight, he remarked, “You must be acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?”“Gregory knew her when she visited the West three years ago,” Miss Marvell revealed. She hesitated before abruptly asking, “Do you both read Society Gossip?”We admitted guiltily. “I ask because this week's issue features an article on famous jewels,” she said, taking the paper from me and reading about the Star of the East and the Star of the West.Poirot, amused, remarked, “A delightful mystery indeed.” He turned to Miss Marvell, “Are you not afraid, madame? No superstitious fears?”“I believe my diamond is superior to Lady Yardly's,” Miss Marvell asserted. “But I intend to find out.”Before Poirot could respond, Gregory Rolf entered the room, exuding charm. “I promised to pick you up, Mary,” he said. “So, what does Monsieur Poirot think of our little dilemma? Just a prank, like I believe?”Poirot, with a wry smile, advised against taking the jewel to Yardly Chase. “I've already told Mary that,” Gregory agreed. “But she's a woman, can't stand the thought of being outshone.”“What nonsense, Gregory!” Mary retorted, though she blushed. Poirot, resigned, bid them farewell. “Women's affairs! The good husband hit the nail on the head, not very tactful indeed.” I shared my suspicions with Poirot, who decided to take a stroll, leaving me to await his return.",1
"“Do you recognize me?” Poirot grinned. “Of course. I follow the news in the papers with pictures. How could I not recognize you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I need your help with a urgent matter. I need absolute secrecy.” “You have my word,” said Poirot grandly. “It involves the Prime Minister. We are facing a serious situation.” “We’re in trouble!” interrupted Mr. Dodge. “Is the injury severe?” I inquired. “What injury?” “The gunshot wound.” “Oh, that,” scoffed Mr. Dodge. “That’s old news.” “As my colleague mentioned,” Lord Estair continued, “that incident is in the past. But unfortunately, there was a second attempt.” “There was another attempt?” “Yes, but of a different kind. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has gone missing.” “What?” “He has been kidnapped!” “Impossible!” I exclaimed, stunned. Poirot shot me a look, silently telling me to stay quiet. “Unfortunately, as impossible as it sounds, it is true,” his lordship added. Poirot turned to Mr. Dodge. “You mentioned that time was crucial. What did you mean?” The two men exchanged glances, and Lord Estair explained: “You are aware of the upcoming Allied Conference?” Poirot nodded. “For security reasons, the details of the Conference have not been disclosed. But the date is widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is scheduled for tomorrow evening in Versailles. Now you understand the gravity of the situation. The Prime Minister’s presence is essential. The Pacifist propaganda has been strong, and the Prime Minister's role is crucial. His absence could lead to disastrous consequences. We have no one else who can represent England.” Poirot’s expression turned serious. “So you believe the kidnapping is an attempt to prevent his attendance at the Conference?” “That is my belief. He was on his way to France at the time.” “And the Conference is still happening?” “Tomorrow night at nine o’clock.” Poirot checked his watch. “It’s a quarter to nine now.” “Twenty-four hours,” mused Mr. Dodge. “And a quarter,” corrected Poirot. “Let’s not forget the quarter, it may be important. Now, about the abduction, did it happen in England or France?” “In France. Mr. MacAdam arrived in France this morning. He was supposed to stay with the Commander-in-Chief, then head to Paris tomorrow. He was escorted across the Channel by a destroyer. In Boulogne, he was met by a car from General Headquarters and the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.” “And then?” “They left Boulogne but never reached their destination.” “What happened?” “The car and the A.D.C. were found gagged and bound in a side road. The bogus car is still missing.” Poirot looked frustrated. “Unbelievable! How could it go unnoticed?” “That area is under Military Law. We expected it to be found quickly, but so far, nothing. French police and Scotland Yard are searching. It’s incredible, but true.” At that moment, a young officer entered with a sealed envelope for Lord Estair. After reading it, Lord Estair announced that the second car and the secretary had been found. They were chloroformed, bound and left in an abandoned farm. “No sign of the Prime Minister’s body?” “No.” “Then there’s hope. But why go through the trouble of keeping him alive after the failed assassination this morning?” Dodge shook his head. “The goal is to prevent him from attending the Conference at all costs.” “If there’s a chance, the Prime Minister will be there. I hope it’s not too late. Now, tell me everything from the beginning. I need to know about the shooting incident as well.”",1

But trouble was brewing, with arms and explosives flowing in under the guise of vegetables. The mastermind behind it all was rumored to be in Johannesburg.

"“Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.” She stopped. “Épatant!” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first water.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?” His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it. “I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to see.” What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance. “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?” Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast. “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I’m with you there, sir. I’ve already said so to Mary. But there! She’s a woman through and through, and I guess she can’t bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.” “What nonsense, Gregory!” said Mary Marvell sharply. But she flushed angrily. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Madame, I have advised. I can do no more. C’est fini.” He bowed them both to the door. “Ah! la la,” he observed, returning. “Histoire de femmes! The good husband, he hit the nail on the head tout de même, he was not tactful! Assuredly not.” I imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously. “So I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath all this. With your permission, mon ami, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her.

It appears the murder swiftly followed the theft, but I leave that determination to you. Feel free to examine the dagger - there are no fingerprints to be found.'""",1
"I must anticipate the little army that will soon be starting. We need to be proactive. Will you be contacting Cook's today, Anne?"" ""What about finances, father?"" I delicately suggested. He gave me a reproachful look. ""Your perspective always brings me down, my dear. We must not be materialistic. No, no, in the pursuit of knowledge, one must not be materialistic."" ""I fear that Cook's may be materialistic, father."" Father looked pained. ""My dear Anne, you will settle with them in cash."" ""I don't have any cash on hand."" Father looked thoroughly exasperated. ""My dear, I really cannot be bothered with these base financial details. The bank tells me I have twenty-seven pounds."" ""That's your overdraft, I believe."" ""Ah, I remember now! Write to my publishers."" I reluctantly agreed, aware that Father's books brought more prestige than wealth. The thought of traveling to Rhodesia excited me greatly. ""Strong, silent men,"" I whispered to myself in delight. But then something about my father's appearance struck me as odd. ""You're wearing mismatched boots, father,"" I pointed out. ""Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don't forget your scarf. It's quite cold out."" In a few minutes, Father left, properly booted and well wrapped in a scarf. He returned late that evening, and, to my horror, I noticed his scarf and coat were missing. ""Oh dear, Anne, you were right. I took them off to enter the cave. One gets quite dirty in there."" I nodded sympathetically, recalling a time when Father had come home covered in Pleistocene clay from head to toe. Our main reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the proximity of Hampsly Cavern, an underground cave rich in Aurignacian culture artifacts. We had a small museum in the village, and the curator and Father spent most of their days excavating underground and uncovering remains of woolly rhinoceroses and cave bears. Father had a bad cough that evening, and the next morning I noticed he had a fever, so I called for the doctor. Poor Father, he never stood a chance. It was double pneumonia. He passed away four days later. Everyone was very kind to me. In my daze, I was grateful for that. I did not feel overwhelming grief. Father had never loved me, I knew that all too well. If he had, perhaps I could have loved him in return. No, love had not existed between us, but we belonged together, and I had cared for him, secretly admiring his knowledge and unwavering dedication to science. It pained me that Father had passed away just when life's excitement was at its peak for him. I would have been happier burying him in a cave, adorned with paintings of reindeer and flint tools, but public opinion dictated a neat grave (with a marble slab) in the unattractive local churchyard. The vicar's attempts at solace, though well-intentioned, did not bring me comfort in the slightest. It took some time for me to realize that the freedom I had always longed for was now mine. I was an orphan, practically penniless, but free. At the same time, I recognized the remarkable kindness of these good people. The vicar tried his best to convince me that his wife needed urgent help as a companion. Our small local library suddenly decided to hire an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor paid me a visit, and after making various absurd excuses for not sending a proper bill, he hesitated and then proposed marriage to me. I was quite surprised. The doctor was closer to forty than thirty, and a round, plump man. He bore no resemblance to the hero of ""The Perils of Pamela,"" and even less to a stern, silent Rhodesian. After pondering for a moment, I asked him why he wanted to marry me. He seemed flustered, mumbling that a wife was a great asset to a General Practitioner. The situation seemed even less romantic now, yet something within me leaned towards accepting it. Safety, that was what was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Looking back now, I believe I misjudged the little man. He genuinely loved me, but a misguided sense of propriety kept him from pursuing me more forcefully. Regardless, my romantic inclinations rebelled. ""Your offer is very kind,"" I said. ""But it's not possible. I could never marry a man unless I was absolutely in love with him."" ""You don't think?"" ""No, I don't,"" I asserted firmly. He sighed. ""But, my dear, what are your plans?"" ""I plan to have adventures and explore the world,"" I declared, without hesitation. ""Miss Anne, you're still very much a child. You don't understand."" ""The practical challenges? Yes, I do, doctor. I'm not a sentimental schoolgirl, I'm a practical, mercenary shrew! If you married me, you'd know it!"" ""I wish you would reconsider."" ""I can't."" He sighed again. ""I have another suggestion. An aunt of mine in Wales is in need of a young lady to assist her. How does that sound?"" ""No, doctor, I'm heading to London. If anything happens anywhere, it's in London. I'll keep my eyes open, and mark my words, something will come up! You'll hear about me next in China or Timbuctoo."" My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Father's solicitor from London. He made a special trip to see me. An avid anthropologist himself, he greatly admired Father's work. He was a tall, thin man with gray hair and a gaunt face. As I entered the room, he rose to greet me, taking both my hands in his and patting them affectionately. ""My poor child,"" he said. ""My poor, poor child."" Without intending to deceive, I found myself adopting the role of a grieving orphan. He somehow compelled me to do so.",1
"""Why must they be cleaned? Do I parade myself on the front like a young man? On Sundays I wear the Sunday boots, of course, but other times!"" he shrugged. I shook my head, disheartened. ""Well, well,"" the magistrate said. ""We are not making much progress. We are surely waiting on the return cable from Santiago. Has anyone seen Giraud? Honestly, that one lacks manners! I am tempted to summon him and-"" ""You won't have to look far, M. le juge."" The calm voice surprised us. Giraud stood outside, peering in through the open window.",1
"I would much rather have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow specks! However, green is a suitable color for daring women. I wrapped a black garment tightly around me, leaving my arms and shoulders exposed. I then pushed my hair back and pulled it down over my ears once more. I applied a generous amount of powder to my face, making my skin appear even paler than usual. I searched until I found some old lip balm, applying a lot of it to my lips. Next, I darkened under my eyes with burnt coal. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over my exposed shoulder, placed a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth. I was quite pleased with the overall effect. ""Anna the Adventuress,"" I exclaimed, nodding at my reflection. ""Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, 'The House in Kensington'!"" Women are foolish creatures. Over the following weeks, I was quite bored. Mrs. Flemming and her friends seemed incredibly uninteresting to me. They chatted about themselves and their children for hours, as well as the challenges of obtaining good milk for their children and how they dealt with the Dairy when the milk was subpar. Then they moved on to discussing servants and the struggles of finding good ones, along with their experiences with the woman at the Registry Office. They appeared to have no interest in reading the news or being aware of current events. They disliked traveling because everything was so different from England. The Riviera was acceptable, of course, because they could see all of their friends there. I listened, barely containing my impatience. Most of these women were wealthy. They had the entire beautiful world at their disposal, yet they chose to stay in dreary, dirty London and talk about milkmen and servants! Looking back now, I realize that I may have been somewhat intolerant. However, they were foolish, so foolish that they couldn't even keep their housekeeping accounts in order. My situation did not improve much. The house and furniture had been sold, and the proceeds barely covered our debts. I had yet to secure a job. Not that I truly desired one! I firmly believed that if I sought adventure, it would come to me. I have always believed that one gets what one desires. My theory was about to be put to the test. It was early January, the 8th to be precise. I was returning from an unsuccessful meeting with a lady who claimed to be seeking a secretary-companion, but in reality needed a strong cleaning lady who would work twelve hours a day for £25 a year. After exchanging veiled insults, I walked along Edgware Road (the meeting had taken place in a house in St. John's Wood) and through Hyde Park to St. George's Hospital. From there, I entered Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and purchased a ticket to Gloucester Road. Once on the platform, I walked to the very end. My curious nature wanted to confirm whether there were indeed points and an opening between the two tunnels just past the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased to discover that I was correct. There were not many people on the platform, and at the far end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I caught a whiff of mothballs. If there is one scent I cannot stand, it is that of mothballs! This man's heavy coat was saturated with the smell. Yet most men began wearing their winter coats before January, so by now the odor should have dissipated. The man was standing near the edge of the tunnel, lost in thought. I was able to observe him without being impolite. He was a small, thin man, with a very tanned face, light blue eyes, and a small dark beard. ""Recently returned from abroad,"" I deduced. ""That explains the smell of his coat. He must have come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn't have a beard. Perhaps a tea planter."" At that moment, the man turned as if to walk back along the platform. His gaze shifted from me to something behind me, and his expression changed. Fear contorted his face, almost in a panic. He took a step back, as if recoiling from some unseen danger, forgetting that he was standing at the very edge of the platform, and he fell over and onto the tracks. There was a bright flash from the rails and a crackling noise. I screamed. People rushed over. Two station employees appeared out of nowhere and took charge. I stood frozen in place, horrified by the sudden tragedy, yet also dispassionately fascinated by the process of lifting the man off the electrified rail and back onto the platform. ""Let me through, please. I am a doctor."" A tall man with a brown beard pushed past me and bent over the motionless body. As he examined the man, a strange feeling of unreality washed over me. It couldn't be real. Finally, the doctor stood up and shook his head. ""Dead as a doornail. There's nothing more to be done."" We all moved closer, and a disgruntled porter raised his voice. ""Step back, will you? There's no sense in crowding around."" A wave of nausea hit me, and I turned and ran blindly up the stairs toward the elevator. It was too awful. I needed to get outside. The doctor who had examined the man was ahead of me. The elevator was about to ascend, after having descended, and he began to run. In his haste, he dropped a piece of paper. I stopped, picked it up, and ran after him. However, the elevator doors closed in my face, leaving me with the paper in hand. By the time the second elevator reached the street level, the doctor was nowhere to be seen.",1

"“Mon ami! Vive l’amour! It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!” After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned. Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being. But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively.",1
"""As an afterthought,"" Poirot inquired, ""has M. Stonor visited Merlinville today?"" Madame Daubreuil calmly responded, ""Not to my knowledge."" Poirot continued, ""Has he met with Mrs. Renauld?"" ""I cannot say, monsieur,"" she replied. With a nod, Poirot concluded, ""I was simply curious if you had seen him around. Good night, madame."" I started to ask, ""Why?"" Poirot interrupted, ""No questions for now, Hastings. There will be opportunity later on.""",1
"""I'm sorry, but I am far from convinced that Jack Renauld is guilty,"" Poirot stated firmly. Giraud couldn't help but laugh, shaking his head in disbelief. Poirot's eyes flashed dangerously. ""Your disrespectful attitude towards me throughout this investigation will not go unpunished. I propose a wager - 500 francs says that I will identify M. Renauld's killer before you. Do we have a deal?"" Giraud was speechless, muttering under his breath once more. ""Let's settle this once and for all,"" Poirot insisted. ""Do we have a deal?"" Giraud hesitated, clearly taken aback.",1
"I found myself staring ahead, a sense of confusion settling in. Norman and I were a formidable pair, capable of handling any challenge. Surprisingly, our journey continued northward, bypassing London altogether. This unexpected detour left me bewildered. Gradually, as the car decelerated, the familiar sights of Hendon Aerodrome came into view. Poirot's plan became clear to me in an instant - we were to fly to France. While bold, the idea seemed impractical at first glance. Sending a telegram would undoubtedly be faster. Time was of the essence, and Poirot would have to forego the personal accolades of saving the Prime Minister. As we came to a stop, Major Norman exited the vehicle, replaced by an undercover officer.",1
"As I approached Lord Nasby's residence, my heart raced with a mixture of determination and fear. The plan to confront him had been brewing inside me for days, fueled by the memory of our disastrous interview. Normally, such a bold move would be out of character for me, but in that moment, anger propelled me forward. Lord Nasby, the wealthy media mogul behind the Daily Budget, was about to face the consequences of his actions. With each step towards his front door, I steeled myself for the confrontation that awaited.",1
"I was shocked to discover that she truly cared for me. I had assumed I was merely a passing fancy, yet she embraced me warmly and wept upon our reunion. After composing ourselves, I sat beside her and recounted the entire saga in detail. ""You always harbored suspicions about Colonel Race,"" she mused once my tale concluded. ""I never doubted him until the night of your disappearance. I held him in high regard and envisioned him as a suitable match for you. Please don't be offended, my dear Anne, but how can you be certain of the veracity of this young man's words? You seem to place unwavering trust in him."" ""I have complete faith in him,"" I protested adamantly.",1
"I caught her off guard with my announcement. ""South Africa? Oh Anne, we must tread carefully if we are to embark on such a journey."" I dreaded the thought of hesitation. I reassured her that my passage was already booked, and that upon arrival I intended to assume the role of a parlourmaid. It was a spontaneous decision, the only option that came to mind. I mentioned the high demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I convinced her that I was capable of looking after myself, and eventually, with a sense of relief in her voice, she agreed to the plan without further questioning.",1
"""Was the man pleased or chagrined? It was unclear. He simply asked Marchaud: “Do you have the other one?” “Yes, sir.” “Then bring her in.” “The other” referred to Madame Daubreuil. She entered angrily, vehemently protesting. “I object, sir! This is an outrage! What is my involvement in all of this?” “Madame,” Giraud said harshly, “I am not investigating one murder, but two! You could be responsible for both for all I know.” “How dare you?” she exclaimed. “How dare you accuse me with such a baseless claim! It is scandalous.” “Scandalous, you say? And what about this?” Bending down, he once again picked up the hair, displaying it. “Do you recognize this, madame?” He moved closer to her.""",1
"“What is your take on that?” I remained silent. I chuckled. Deep down, I was aware of the imminent danger. In that moment, he despised me. Yet, I found myself drawn to the danger, reveling in the sensation of his hands around my throat. I wouldn't trade that moment for anything else. With a brief chuckle, he let go of me. ""What's your name?"" he inquired abruptly. ""Anne Beddingfeld."" ""Is there nothing that scares you, Anne Beddingfeld?"" ""Oh, indeed,"" I responded, trying to appear composed despite feeling otherwise. ""Wasps, snarky women, overly young men, cockroaches, and condescending store clerks."" He chuckled briefly once more. Then, he nudged the unconscious Pagett with his foot.",1
"""My father passed away when I was just six years old. A few years later, my mother also left this world. The only family I had left was my Uncle Andrew, who had returned from Australia and bought Crabtree Manor, a small farmhouse, in his home county. Despite his kind treatment of me, he had very traditional views on the upbringing of women, valuing practical skills over book knowledge. I, however, rebelled against his wishes, determined to pursue my education. When my uncle passed away, his will revealed a challenge for me - to prove my intelligence within a year to inherit his fortune. I enlisted the help of Hercule Poirot to solve this puzzle, believing it to be a test of wits left by my uncle.""",1
"""The meticulous examination of fingerprints and footprints, cigarette ash, various soil types, and other evidentiary traces is undeniably crucial."" ""Absolutely. I have never disputed that. The seasoned observer, the specialist, undoubtedly they are valuable! However, the likes of Hercules Poirot, they transcend the specialists! They are presented with the evidence by the experts, their concern is the crime's methodology, its reasoned inference, the correct arrangement and organization of the evidence; most importantly, the genuine psychological understanding of the situation.""",1
"Yes, I was content, yet there lingered a sense of anticipation, as if something awaited me on the horizon. Restlessness tingled beneath my skin. Following our tea, we meandered outside, boarded the tram, and were guided by jovial attendants along the narrow rails to the bridge. The grandeur of the scene unfolded before us - the vast gorge, the tumultuous waters below, and the misty shroud that occasionally parted to reveal the majestic waterfall, only to quickly conceal it once more in enigmatic secrecy. This, I concluded, is the allure of the Falls - their enigmatic nature.",1
"The room was adorned with curtains and portière in a muted green hue, perfectly complemented by the matching carpet. Poirot carefully surveyed the space, running his hand over the leather chairs, inspecting the magazine on the table, and lightly touching the oak sideboard. A look of satisfaction crossed his face. ""No dust?"" I teased. He smiled warmly, acknowledging my understanding of his preferences. ""Not a speck, my friend! Though, perhaps, a bit unfortunate this time."" His keen eyes scanned the room before he exclaimed, ""Ah!"" in a tone of relief.",1
"Poirot turned to us, his tone serious. ""Each criminal has his own method,"" he began, addressing us collectively. ""The police can often make a shrewd guess at the offender simply by the peculiar method he has employed."" Giraud, unimpressed, snorted at the suggestion of masked men. ""There have been many affairs,"" he retorted. ""These crimes all resemble each other more or less."" Poirot, undeterred, continued, ""There is such a thing as the individual touch.""",1
"As we raced against time to outsmart the cunning Andrew Marsh, our efforts proved futile and his niece remained in peril. Rushing to the station, we managed to board a train bound for London, albeit not the fastest one. Poirot appeared dejected, while I struggled to stay awake in my seat. Suddenly, near Taunton, Poirot let out a sharp cry. ""Quick, Hastings! Wake up and jump! Jump, I tell you!"" In a daze, we found ourselves on the platform, without our belongings, watching the train vanish into the darkness. Anger boiled inside me, but Poirot remained unfazed.",1

The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank.

The village had a worn lending library, where I indulged in tales of adventure and romance, falling asleep to dreams of bold Rhodesians and men who triumphed effortlessly in combat.",1
"I now understood. They were like Cinderella, young but fixated on morbid excitement, seeking sensation without regard for decency or good feeling. Despite being drawn to the girl's beauty, I couldn't shake my initial disapproval. Thoughts of my deceased mother surfaced. What would she think of this modern twist on girlhood? A pretty face masked with paint and powder, concealing a ghoulish mind. ""Get off your high horse,"" the lady interjected abruptly. ""Stop pretending. When you were called to this job, did you act all snooty, saying it was distasteful and you wanted no part in it?"" ""No, but..."" ""If you were here on vacation, wouldn't you be just as curious as I am? Of course you would."" ""I'm a man. You're a woman."" ""Your view of women is outdated. But will you show me around, please? It could make a big difference for me."" ""How?"" ""They're keeping the reporters out. I could get a big scoop with one of the papers. You have no idea how much they pay for insider information."" I hesitated. She placed a soft hand in mine. ""Please, be a dear."" I gave in. Deep down, I knew that I would enjoy playing the role of guide. The girl's moral stance was not my concern. I did have some anxiety about the examining magistrate's reaction, but reassured myself that no harm would come of it. We headed first to where the body was found. A guard saluted me, recognizing me, and didn't question my companion. I explained the discovery to Cinderella, who listened attentively and asked intelligent questions. Then we made our way to the Villa. Proceeding cautiously, I led the girl through the shrubbery to the back of the house where the small shed stood. Remembering that M. Bex had left the key with Marchaud the previous evening, I assumed the detective had returned it to him. Leaving the girl hidden in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was stationed outside the salon. ""Do you need Hautet, monsieur? He's inside interrogating Françoise again."" ""No,"" I replied quickly, ""I don't need him. But I would like the key to the shed if possible."" ""Certainly, monsieur."" He handed it over. ""Return it when you're done out there."" ""Of course."" I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that, at least in Marchaud's eyes, I was on par with Poirot. The girl was waiting, delighted to see the key in my possession. ""You got it?"" she asked eagerly. ""Yes,"" I replied calmly. ""What I'm doing is quite irregular, you know."" ""You've been wonderful. Let's go. They can't see us from the house, right?"" ""Wait."" I stopped her. ""It's going to be unpleasant and gruesome. Are you sure you want to go in?"" She looked at me with an inscrutable expression, then laughed. ""I'm up for it,"" she declared. ""Let's go."" Quietly, we reached the shed's door. I opened it, revealing the body. As I pulled down the sheet, a gasp escaped the girl. I turned to see horror on her face, her high spirits extinguished. She had ignored my advice and was now facing the consequences. I felt a coldness towards her. She needed to see this through. Gently, I turned the corpse over. ""He was stabbed in the back,"" I informed her. Her voice barely audible, she asked, ""With what?"" I gestured towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" The girl suddenly staggered and collapsed. Rushing to her aid, I realized she was faint. ""Let's get out of here. It's too much for you."" ""Water,"" she whispered. ""Quick. Water..."" I left momentarily to fetch water and a bit of brandy. When I returned, the girl had revived. ""Take me away from here, quickly!"" she pleaded, trembling. Supporting her, I led her outside, closing the shed door behind us. She breathed a sigh of relief. ""That's better. It was awful! Why did you let me go in?"" I couldn't help but smile at her feminine reaction.",1
"""Back in the day, men and women were equals. Papa used to say they roamed the world together like lions and tigers,"" Colonel Race chimed in with a smirk, ""And giraffes?"" I couldn't help but laugh at the mention of giraffes. ""Yes, giraffes too. They were nomads, you know. It wasn't until they settled in communities that women's strength waned. Deep down, we're all the same. Women still admire physical strength in men because it's what they once possessed and now lack.""",1
"As the men gathered in the hall for breakfast, their voices echoed up the stairs, causing me great unease. I knew I had to remain patient in order to find a way out of the house without being caught. After breakfast, I heard the sounds of Chichester leaving, and to my relief, the Dutchman followed suit. Waiting anxiously, I took note as breakfast dishes were cleared and the household chores commenced. Finally, as the commotion subsided, I cautiously emerged from my hiding spot and stealthily made my way down the staircase.",1

There are not one, but two crimes here. I have cracked the first, but as for the second, well, I must admit, I am uncertain!""""But, Poirot, didn't you claim that the man in the shed died of natural causes?""""Tsk tsk tsk."" Poirot let out his signature sigh of impatience. ""You still don't grasp it. A crime can exist without a murderer, but in the case of two crimes, two bodies are indispensable.""",1
"The solution did not appeal to me, because, as I mentioned to you, Hastings, a skilled detective like myself enjoys facing a worthy adversary. However, one must deal with crimes as they are, not as one wishes them to be. It was unlikely that Bella Duveen would be walking around with a souvenir paper-knife in hand, but perhaps she had been planning revenge on Jack Renauld all along. Even when she confessed to the murder, something felt off. I couldn't shake the feeling of unease, my friend. Unease lingered within me.",1
"In contrast, I found myself silently pleased. I am not a complete idiot. ""Nevertheless,"" I stated seriously, ""I believe we will."" ""Why?"" I shook my head, unable to articulate the emotion behind my words. ""I never want to lay eyes on you again,"" he abruptly and forcefully declared. It was quite impolite, but I merely chuckled quietly and disappeared into the shadows. I heard him begin to follow me, then stop, and a single word drifted down the deck. I believe it was ""witch""!

"“May I bring in this gentleman to assist?” Mr. Opalsen asked. The man nodded, showing no interest. “Now that your wife is feeling better, can she tell us what happened?” Mrs. Opalsen turned to Poirot for guidance. He motioned for her to sit and share the details. Mrs. Opalsen composed herself and began, “I went to my room after dinner to get my pearls. The chambermaid and Célestine were both present, as they always were.” Mr. Opalsen interjected, “What do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mrs. Opalsen clarified.",1
"“Altitude seems to be doing wonders for me.”“Fresh air is truly invigorating,” remarked Colonel Race, with a smile.“Being cooped up in those cramped cabins would be the end of anyone,” Mrs. Blair stated, as she settled into a seat beside me and dismissed her companion with a slight nod.“Do you have an exterior cabin?” she inquired.I shook my head.“My dear, why not switch? There are plenty of vacancies. Many passengers disembarked at Madeira, and the ship is quite sparse. Have a word with the purser. He’s quite accommodating - he moved me to a lovely cabin because I wasn’t satisfied with the one I had. Speak with him during lunch when you head downstairs.”I felt a chill run down my spine.",1
"""We headed to the opposite side of the deck, where a sparkling white pinnacle rose in the distance, draped in a soft rose-coloured mist. Delighted, I couldn't help but exclaim. Mrs. Blair rushed to grab her camera. Despite Colonel Race's sarcastic remarks, she continued snapping away: “This is the last shot. Oh,” her tone shifted to disappointment, “I accidentally had it on ‘bulb’ the whole time.” “I always enjoy watching a child with a new toy,” the Colonel remarked. “You're so mean, but I have another roll.""",1
"Just as I was beginning to doubt my eyes, a figure entered the room with such vigor that for a moment I thought the dead had risen. It was only when I noticed the absence of any trace of age on his dark hair that I realized it was a mere youth standing before us. Ignoring the onlookers, he made a beeline for Mrs. Renauld. ""Mother!"" he exclaimed. ""Jack!"" she cried out in return, embracing him tightly. ""What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be sailing on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?"" After a moment, she composed herself and introduced him to the others with a hint of pride, ""Gentlemen, this is my son.""",1
"An incident quickly unfolded that deeply impacted the public consciousness. Suddenly, Sir John Willard passed away from a heart attack. Sensational tabloids wasted no time in resurrecting eerie tales linked to the cursed Egyptian artifacts. Despite the British Museum's dismissal, the infamous Mummy was once again thrust into the spotlight. Just two weeks later, Mr. Bleibner succumbed to lethal blood poisoning, followed shortly by his nephew's tragic suicide in New York.",1
"""I watched as she prepared for a long night ahead. Taking a seat, I expressed my confusion at her distress. ""My dream - that dinner we had,"" she exclaimed. I raised an eyebrow at her reaction to the curry. ""Oh, Sir Eustace!"" she cried, clearly upset. But we both knew that nightmares often follow a heavy meal. Trying to calm her, I suggested that Anne Beddingfeld and Race were simply taking a late-night walk without causing a commotion. ""Do you really believe they're just out for a stroll at this hour?"" she questioned. ""People do foolish things when they're young,"" I replied, defending their actions. ""Although Race should certainly know better.""",1
"""I feel the need to go to Rhodesia after hearing your story, Colonel Race,"" Mrs. Blair stated. ""It's quite a dreadful journey though, five days in the train."" ""You should accompany me in my private car,"" I offered graciously, to which Mrs. Blair expressed her gratitude. In a sentimental tone, I mentioned South Africa and its treasures. Mrs. Blair and Miss Beddingfeld were captivated by the mention of diamonds. Colonel Race then recounted a fascinating story about a diamond robbery involving Sir Laurence Eardsley and his son. The tale stirred my new secretary, Rayburn, who appeared visibly moved. Anne Beddingfeld's curiosity about Rayburn was evident, prompting me to share a brief explanation.",1
"""Ten minutes passed before the door creaked open, revealing a slim figure dressed in mourning attire. 'Monsieur Poirot?' she hesitated. Poirot gallantly rose to his feet and hurried to her side. 'Madame!' he exclaimed. 'I apologize for the intrusion. But alas, business knows no bounds.' Mrs. Maltravers allowed him to guide her to a chair. Her eyes were swollen from crying, yet her beauty shone through. She appeared to be in her late twenties, fair-skinned with piercing blue eyes and a delicate mouth.""",1
"""Giraud, the renowned Giraud, chuckles inwardly, underestimating the old man. But time will reveal the truth..."" My focus shifted back to the crucial details. ""So, the masked men - all a fabrication?"" ""Indeed."" ""Then what truly transpired?"" Poirot simply shrugged. ""Only Madame Renauld knows. Yet, she remains silent. A woman of exceptional fortitude, Hastings. From the moment I laid eyes on her, I sensed her uncommon resilience. Initially, I suspected her involvement in the crime. However, my perspective evolved over time.""",1
"""We proceeded in silence. Once there, much to my surprise, Poirot swiftly changed his attire. ""I am heading to London tonight,"" he stated. ""It is crucial."" ""What?"" ""Absolutely. The real mental work is completed. I am off to confirm. I will discover it! Impossible to outsmart Hercule Poirot!"" ""You'll fail one day,"" I remarked, feeling repulsed by his arrogance. ""Do not be upset, my friend. I am relying on your friendship for a favor."" ""Of course,"" I replied eagerly, feeling remorseful for my sullenness.",1
"""It wasn't cheerful, but it offered a brief respite. I had until the next day. This man was clearly following orders from someone higher up. Could that someone be Pagett? He called out and two Kafirs appeared. I was escorted upstairs. Despite my resistance, I was gagged and bound hand and foot. The room they took me to was an attic under the roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of recent occupation. The Dutchman made a mocking bow and left, closing the door behind him. I was completely helpless. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't loosen my hands or make a sound due to the gag. I heard a door shut below. The Dutchman was leaving. I was frustrated at my inability to do anything. I struggled against my bonds, but the knots held tight. Eventually, I either fainted or fell asleep. When I woke up, I was in pain all over. It was dark, with the moon shining through the skylight. The gag was choking me and the pain was unbearable. I noticed a piece of broken glass in a corner, and an idea struck me. Slowly, I managed to roll toward it. It took a long time, but I eventually sawed through the cords binding my wrists. After undoing the gag, I restored the circulation to my hands and stood up. I waited to regain my strength before tiptoeing to the unlocked door. Peeking out, I saw the coast was clear. Everyone was preoccupied downstairs. I crept down, hearing voices from the room I was initially taken to. The Dutchman and another man, whom I recognized as Mr. Chichester, were discussing something. They mentioned a 'Colonel' and the need for information from a girl. I listened intently through the keyhole. After a while, they finished their conversation and Chichester left with some lists. I waited for the right moment and then made my escape, managing to leave the house unnoticed. I ran to a garage and requested a car to take me to Cape Town. I needed to catch a boat to Durban to find Chichester. Unfortunately, I missed the boat and was left wondering about my next move. Suzanne was relieved to see me but curious about my adventures. We contemplated our next steps, unsure of Chichester's whereabouts. After learning about train schedules to Durban, I decided to wait and see if Chichester showed up. The situation was complicated, and I needed to be cautious. Suzanne and I chatted with Colonel Race, who informed us about a mysterious man in disguise on the boat. Sir Eustace shared his troubles with us, frustrated by recent events. After an eventful day, we retired to Sir Eustace's sitting room for tea, where he poured out his grievances. It was clear that he was in a difficult spot, dealing with a murder and a troublesome secretary. The afternoon ended with laughter and light-hearted banter, a welcome break from the chaos surrounding us.""",1
"""He discovered some spare change in his pants pocket."" ""But no wallet."" ""Some individuals do not carry a wallet or purse of any sort."" I attempted a different approach. ""You do not find it strange that the physician never appeared afterwards?"" ""A busy doctor often does not keep up with the news. He likely forgot all about the incident."" ""In truth, detective, you seem intent on finding nothing unusual,"" I remarked politely. ""Well, I believe you use the term a bit too frequently, Miss Beddingfeld. Young women tend to be idealistic, I understand, fascinated by enigmas and similar matters. However, as I am pressed for time"" I took the cue and stood up.",1
"Poirot raised an eyebrow, ""M. Stonor, how long has the English chauffeur, Masters, been with M. Renauld?"" Stonor replied confidently, ""Over a year."" Poirot continued, ""And has he ever traveled to South America?"" Stonor shook his head, ""I'm quite sure he hasn't. Before working for Mr. Renauld, he was in Gloucestershire for many years with people I know."" Poirot pressed, ""So you can vouch for him as being beyond suspicion?"" Stonor nodded, ""Absolutely.""",1
"She stood there with her gaze fixed downward, the same barely discernible enigmatic grin that I could recall on her lips. And suddenly, a sense of fear crept over me, like one might feel when faced with a beautiful yet deadly serpent. ""I trust we have not disturbed you, madame,"" Poirot politely remarked as she held the door open for us to exit. ""Not in the least, monsieur."" ""By the way,"" Poirot began, as though struck by a sudden thought, ""M. Stonor did not visit Merlinville today, did he?"" The purpose of this question completely eluded me, as I knew it to be meaningless in Poirot's eyes. Madame Daubreuil responded calmly: ""Not that I am aware of."" ""He did not meet with Mrs. Renauld?"" ""How would I know, monsieur?"" ""Indeed,"" Poirot acknowledged. ""I merely thought you might have seen him arriving or leaving. Good night, madame."" ""Why-"" I started. ""No explanations now, Hastings. There will be time for that later."" We reunited with Cinderella and hurried towards the Villa Geneviève. Poirot glanced back at the illuminated window and Marthe's profile as she focused on her task. ""He is under surveillance, at least,"" he muttered. Upon reaching the Villa Geneviève, Poirot positioned himself behind some bushes to the left of the driveway, allowing us a good view while remaining hidden. The Villa was engulfed in darkness, everyone likely fast asleep. We found ourselves directly beneath the open window of Mrs. Renauld's bedroom, upon which Poirot's gaze seemed fixed. ""What is our plan?"" I whispered. ""We wait."" ""But-"" ""I do not anticipate any activity for at least an hour, perhaps two, but-"" Our conversation was cut short by a prolonged, piercing cry: ""Help!"" A light flickered to life in a room on the second floor to the right of the house. The cry had originated from there. As we watched, a shadow appeared on the window blind, hinting at a struggle between two individuals. ""Mille tonnerres!"" exclaimed Poirot. ""She must have changed rooms!"" With determination, he rushed to the front door, pounding on it frantically. Then, without hesitation, he climbed a nearby tree with feline agility. I followed suit, and as he leaped through the open window, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. ""Be careful,"" I warned. ""Mind your grandmother!"" the girl retorted. ""This is nothing to me."" Poirot dashed through the empty room and began pounding on the door leading to the corridor. ""Locked and bolted from the outside,"" he growled. ""It will take time to force it open."" The cries for help were growing fainter. Desperation clouded Poirot's eyes. Together, we pushed against the door. Cinderella's composed voice drifted in from the window: ""You are running out of time. I believe I am the only one who can help."" Before I could react, she seemed to leap into the air. Alarmed, I peered out and saw her hanging from the roof, inching toward the lighted window. ""Heaven help us! She will fall,"" I exclaimed. ""Do not forget, Hastings, she is an acrobat by trade. It was a stroke of luck that she insisted on accompanying us tonight. I only pray she arrives in time. Ah!"" A cry of sheer terror pierced the night as Cinderella vanished through the right-hand window; then, in her clear voice came the words: ""No, you will not escape! I have a firm grip, my wrists are like steel."" Simultaneously, the door to our confinement was cautiously opened by Françoise. Poirot pushed past her and sprinted down the corridor where the other maids were gathered around another door. ""It is locked from the inside, monsieur."" A heavy thud resonated from within. After a brief pause, the key turned, and the door creaked open. Cinderella, visibly shaken, motioned for us to enter. ""Is she safe?"" Poirot demanded. ""Yes, I arrived just in time. She was exhausted."" Mrs. Renauld was sprawled on the bed, struggling to breathe. ""Nearly strangled me,"" she whispered hoarsely. The girl picked up an object from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a coiled silk rope ladder, delicate yet sturdy. ""An escape plan,"" Poirot deduced. ""Through the window, while we were trying to break down the door. But where is the other one?"" The girl gestured towards a figure shrouded in dark fabric on the ground, its face obscured. ""Dead?"" I gasped. ""I believe so,"" she nodded. ""Their head likely struck the marble fender."" ""But who is it?"" I inquired. ""The killer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the attempted murderer of Madame Renauld."" My recollections of the subsequent events of that fateful night are a blur. Poirot seemed unresponsive to my inquiries, instead focusing on reprimanding Françoise for failing to inform him of Mrs. Renauld's room change. I grabbed his shoulder, determined to capture his attention and make myself heard. ""But you must have known,"" I protested. ""You were escorted to see her this afternoon."" Poirot spared me a momentary glance. ""She had been wheeled into the central room- her boudoir,"" he clarified. ""But, monsieur,"" Françoise interjected, ""Madame relocated almost immediately following the incident! The memories were too painful!"" ""Then why was I not informed,"" Poirot bellowed, striking the table and working himself into a rage. ""Explain to me why I was kept in the dark! You are a senile old woman! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are utter imbeciles! Your incompetence nearly led to the demise of your mistress. If not for this brave child-"" He paused, crossing the room to where the girl was tending to Mrs. Renauld, embracing her with fervor, much to my chagrin.",1
"""It's impossible! The housekeeper was there when the shot rang out."" ""Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she's vanished."" ""She'll turn up."" ""I doubt it. There's something mysteriously slippery about that housekeeper, wouldn't you say, Hastings? It struck me immediately."" ""She did her job, I suppose, and then disappeared just in time."" ""And what exactly was her job?"" ""Well, most likely to create an alibi for Mrs. Havering when the shot was fired."" ""Oh, no, that wasn't her job! Her job was exactly what you just mentioned, to give Mrs. Havering an alibi at the time the shot was fired.""",1
"I had been stuck in that room for what felt like an eternity. The glass was my only hope of escape. It took forever, but I finally managed to saw through the cords binding my wrists. Once free, I cautiously made my way out of the room and down the staircase, where I overheard a conversation between my Dutch friend and Mr. Chichester. They were discussing something about a girl who knew too much and needed to be taken care of. I quickly retreated to the attic to avoid being caught eavesdropping. It was clear that danger lurked in that house, and I needed to find a way out before it was too late.",1
"“Detective Poirot addressed the group with a list of seemingly random words: ‘Name,’ ‘Place,’ ‘Tuesday,’ ‘Dinner,’ ‘Journey,’ ‘Country,’ ‘Story,’ ‘Rook Rifle,’ ‘Shot,’ ‘Suicide,’ ‘Money.’ The room fell silent as Poirot’s gaze settled on each person in turn. ‘Thank you all for your cooperation,’ he said, dismissing them with a wave of his hand. Later, as the suspects filed out, Poirot turned to me with a knowing smile. ‘Do you see it now, Hastings?’ he asked. I was at a loss. ‘I’m afraid not,’ I admitted. ‘Allow me to enlighten you,’ Poirot replied, leaning in to share his insights.”",1
"""It's a small, elegant spot nestled between Bolougne and Calais. Lately, it's been gaining popularity among wealthy Brits seeking tranquility. Does M. Renauld own property in England?"" ""Yes, in Rutland Gate, and a sizable estate in Hertfordshire. Not much is known about him socially. He's rumored to have significant business dealings in South America, primarily in Chile and Argentina."" ""We'll find out more from the man directly. Let's get ready to leave.""",1

""It seems unfair to you, as Mr. Marsh was your only living relative,"" the woman remarked. ""I don't see it that way. Uncle Andrew gave me fair warning, and I made my choice. Since I didn't comply with his wishes, he had every right to leave his wealth to whoever he pleased.""",1
"""I have a few arrangements already in place. Release me, provide me with a head start, and I will leave behind a signed confession admitting to the murder of Nadina."" ""Absolutely, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He looked at me sternly. ""No, Anne, absolutely not. You don't know what you're suggesting."" ""I do. It's the perfect solution."" ""I could never face Race again. I'll take my chances, but I refuse to let this cunning old man slip away. It's not an option, Anne. I won't do it."" Sir Eustace chuckled, conceding defeat without any hint of emotion. ""Oh well,"" he commented.",1
"""At the stroke of three, we found ourselves back at Charing Cross station. Despite our protests, Poirot remained steadfast, insisting that starting at square one was not a futile endeavor, but rather the only logical course of action. During our journey, he had a hushed conversation with Norman, who promptly sent off a flurry of telegrams from Dover. Thanks to Norman's connections, we breezed through each checkpoint with unprecedented speed. Upon our arrival in London, a sleek police vehicle awaited us, accompanied by plain-clothed officers. One of them passed a typed document to Poirot, silently answering my unspoken question.""",1
"I gasped in shock as I saw her standing there, a suppressed shriek escaping her lips. It was Cinderella, my friend from the train. The surprise was mutual as we both exclaimed in unison. ""You!"" she cried, her eyes wide. ""My only Aunt!"" I replied, taken aback. ""What are you doing here?"" The conversation quickly turned playful as we bantered back and forth, reminiscing on past encounters. Cinderella's mischievous smile never faded as she revealed her love for crimes and mysteries. I couldn't help but be intrigued by her eagerness to explore the crime scene at the Villa Geneviève. Despite my reluctance, she insisted on tagging along, eager to see all the details of the investigation.",1
"Ventnor, who had stayed in cabin C 24 adjacent to Philip Ridgeway's, had intrigued me with Poirot's deductions about his existence and appearance. Eagerly, I inquired if Ventnor was among the first to disembark in New York, only to learn he was actually one of the last. Disheartened, I watched Poirot's amused expression as he thanked the steward and we left. Frustrated, I pointed out how the information contradicted Poirot's theory, but he simply grinned and remarked, ""As usual, you see nothing, Hastings.""",1
"Revised text excerpt: ""If she was able to eavesdrop on that, there is no reason she wouldn't have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were careless enough to discuss their plans while seated on the bench. Recall how effortlessly you caught Marthe conversing with Jack Renauld from that very location."" ""But what reason could Marthe possibly have for killing Mr. Renauld?"" I countered. ""What reason? Greed! M. Renauld was a multi-millionaire, and upon his demise (or so she and Jack thought) half of that immense fortune would go to his son. Let's imagine the scenario from Marthe Daubreuil's perspective. ""Marthe Daubreuil listens in on the conversation between Renauld and his wife.""",1
"""I shuddered. Then a thought struck me. “You say you didn’t know I was there. What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he did not seem to notice. “How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?” I asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. “And what are you doing in this part of the world, anyway?” “I live here,” he said simply. “On this island?” “Yes, I came here after the War. Sometimes I take parties from the hotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to live, and mostly I do as I please.” “You live here all alone?” “I am not pining for society, I assure you,” he replied coldly. “I am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,” I retorted, “but I seem to have had very little to say in the matter.” To my surprise his eyes twinkled a little. “None whatever. I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal and carried you to my boat. Quite like a primitive man of the Stone Age.” “But for a different reason,” I put in. He flushed this time, a deep burning blush. The tan of his face was suffused. “But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless disturbed had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death. No, I swore to myself that I’d take better care of you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this island. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come and look after you. She’s loyal. She’ll never say a word. I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know.” I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know! How some words please one! “You did quite right,” I said quietly. “And I shall not send word to any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn’t make much difference. It’s not as though they were my own people. They’re only acquaintances really even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must have known a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.” I managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all. “If you would be guided by me” he said, hesitating. “I don’t expect I shall be,” I answered candidly. “But there’s no harm in hearing.",1
"""For example, if the goal of the killers was revenge, why didn't they just stab Renauld while he was sleeping and be done with it?"" ""They were after the 'secret,'"" I pointed out. Poirot flicked a speck of dust off his sleeve with a dissatisfied expression. ""So, where is this 'secret'? Presumably some distance away, considering they wanted him to get dressed. Yet he was found murdered nearby, almost within earshot of the house. And then, it's just chance that a weapon like the dagger was conveniently lying around, ready to be used."" He paused, furrowing his brow, and continued, ""Why didn't the servants hear anything? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice who made sure the front door was left open? I wonder if..."" He stopped abruptly as we arrived at the driveway in front of the house. Suddenly, he turned to me. ""My friend, get ready to be surprised! I have taken your criticisms to heart! We will investigate some footprints!"" ""Where?"" ""In that bed over there on the right. M. Bex claims they belong to the gardener. Let's see if that's true. Look, here comes the gardener with his wheelbarrow."" Indeed, an elderly man was making his way across the driveway with a cart full of seedlings. Poirot called out to him, and he approached us. ""You need something from me, sir?"" ""Yes. You've been the gardener here for a long time, correct?"" ""Twenty-four years, sir."" ""And your name is?"" ""Auguste, sir."" ""I was admiring these beautiful geraniums. They are truly outstanding. Have they been here for a while?"" ""Some time, sir. But to keep the beds looking neat, you have to plant new ones and remove the old blooms."" ""You planted new ones yesterday, didn't you? In the middle there, and in the other bed as well?"" ""Sir has a keen eye. It takes a day or so for them to 'pick up.' Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Sir probably knows, you shouldn't plant when the sun is too hot."" Auguste was delighted by Poirot's interest and was quite talkative. ""That one there is a magnificent specimen,"" Poirot said, pointing. ""Could I have a cutting of it, perhaps?"" ""Of course, sir."" The old man stepped into the bed and carefully took a cutting from the plant Poirot had admired. Poirot thanked him profusely, and Auguste went back to his wheelbarrow. ""You see?"" Poirot said with a smile as he examined the indentation of the gardener's boot in the bed. ""It's quite simple."" ""I didn't realize..."" ""That the foot would be inside the boot? You don't use your excellent mental abilities enough. Well, what about the footprint?"" I carefully inspected the bed. ""All the footprints in the bed were made by the same boot,"" I concluded after a thorough examination. ""You think so? Well, I agree,"" Poirot said, seeming uninterested and lost in thought. ""At least,"" I remarked, ""you can now drop your interest in these footprints."" But to my surprise, Poirot shook his head. ""No, no, my friend. I am finally on the right track. I am still in the dark, but as I suggested to M. Bex earlier, these footprints are the most crucial and intriguing aspects of the case! I wouldn't be surprised if poor Giraud paid no attention to them at all.""",1
"It was well past midnight when I stood on the deck, gazing at the luminous wake left by the boat. The outline of Africa loomed in the distance, drawing closer as we sped through the black sea. In that moment, I found myself engulfed in a sense of solitude within a magnificent universe. Enveloped by an eerie calm, I lingered there, oblivious to the passage of time, lost in reverie. Abruptly, a strange feeling of imminent peril washed over me. Though there was no sound, a sudden instinct made me whirl around. A shadowy figure had stealthily approached from behind. Before I could react, it pounced. With a firm grip on my neck, it silenced any potential outcry. Despite my frantic struggles, I knew the odds were against me.",1
"""Very well,"" I said weakly. ""You won't mention to anyone that I'm coming with you."" ""Very well,"" I repeated. It may be better to have this guy with me, but I had a feeling that I was headed into trouble. Just when I thought I had found peace! I stopped him as he was leaving. ""I should probably know the name of my new secretary,"" I remarked sarcastically. He thought for a moment. ""Harry Rayburn sounds like a good name,"" he said. It was an odd way of putting it. ""Very well,"" I said for the third time.",1
"” The case was kept quiet to the best of their ability, and to this day, the mysterious deaths linked to the Tomb of Men-her-Ra are seen as a vindication of a long-gone king's retribution against those who violated his resting place. A theory that, as Poirot pointed out to me, goes against all Egyptian beliefs. “Poirot,” I suggested, “maybe a change of scenery would be beneficial for you.” “You think so, my friend?” “I am certain of it.” “Oh? Is everything arranged already?” “Will you join me?” “Where are we headed?” “Brighton. A colleague of mine in the City tipped me off to a lucrative opportunity, and well, I have money to spare. I believe a weekend at the Grand Metropolitan would be just what we need.” “Thank you, I graciously accept. You are kind to think of an old man. And kindness, in the end, surpasses all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I, who am speaking to you, sometimes forget that.” I was slightly put off by the implication. I suspect Poirot occasionally underestimates my intellectual capabilities. But his delight was so obvious that I pushed aside my minor irritation. “In that case, all is well,” I quickly added. Saturday evening found us dining at the Grand Metropolitan among a lively crowd. Everyone and their spouse seemed to be in Brighton. The gowns were stunning, and the jewels, at times flaunted with more flamboyance than elegance, were truly spectacular. “Ah, what a spectacle!” murmured Poirot. “This is the abode of the Profiteer, is it not, Hastings?” “It is believed to be,” I responded. “But let's hope they aren't all tainted by profiteering.” Poirot surveyed the scene calmly. “The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my mind to crime, rather than its investigation. What a splendid opportunity for a distinguished thief! Look, Hastings, at that stout woman near the pillar. She is absolutely dripping with gems.” I followed his gaze. “Why,” I exclaimed, “it's Mrs. Opalsen.” “You know her?” “A little. Her husband is a wealthy stockbroker who struck it rich in the recent Oil craze.” After dinner, we bumped into the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a bit, and ended up having coffee together. Poirot complimented some of the more expensive jewels adorning the lady's generous bosom, and she lit up immediately. “It's a passion of mine, Mr. Poirot. I adore jewelry. Ed is aware of my weakness, and whenever things go well, he surprises me with something new. Are you fascinated by precious stones?” “I have had my share of dealings with them on various occasions, madame. My line of work has brought me into contact with some of the most renowned jewels in the world.” He proceeded to narrate, using discreet aliases, the tale of the historic jewels of a royal family, and Mrs. Opalsen listened intently. “There you have it!” she exclaimed at the end. “Isn't it just like a play! You know, I own some pearls of my own that have quite a story attached to them. They're believed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world, the pearls are so exquisitely matched and perfectly colored.",1
"She carefully examined the portrait of Rev. Edward Chichester, tilting her head to the side. ""An excellent likeness. Now, onto the rest."" Handing me the paper, she inquired, ""Is that your stewardess?"" Excitedly, I confirmed, ""Yes, that's Suzanne. How did you know?"" She brushed off the praise. ""I've always been suspicious of Chichester. Remember how he reacted when we mentioned Crippen? And he attempted to claim Cabin 17!"" ""It's all coming together,"" I agreed.",1
"""Schneider today,"" and then some more of the same. Young Bleibner hurried off to Cairo immediately."" ""Was he in good health when he left?"" ""The old man?"" ""No, the young one."" ""He did mention some health issues, but nothing serious, or I would have remembered."" ""One last thing, did Mr. Bleibner have a will?"" ""To our knowledge, he did not."" ""Will you be staying with the expedition, Mr. Harper?"" ""No, sir, I will not. I plan to head to New York as soon as I can wrap things up here.""",1
"""It appeared she was unable to tear her gaze away from Race. She approached me this evening, hesitatingly mentioning a favor she wished to request. Could I manage her keepsakes on her behalf? ""Not the creatures?"" I exclaimed, filled with sudden dread. I had always feared being burdened with those dreadful animals eventually. After some negotiation, we reached an agreement. I agreed to safeguard two delicate items in small wooden boxes for her. The animals will be carefully packed by the nearby shop into large crates and shipped to Cape Town by train, where Pagett will arrange for their storage.""",1
"I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown. “Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair...",1
"Arriving at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.” “Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s only that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself all right.” Poirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked himself.",1
"I always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with nervous eyes. His serious tone made me uneasy. “What do you mean, Poirot?” “We will find out soon enough, my friend. But I must go.” “You have plenty of time.” “Maybe maybe. But I prefer to take it easy at the station. I don't want to rush.” “I'll see you off,” I said, standing up. “Absolutely not. I won't allow it.” His firmness surprised me. He nodded decisively. “I'm serious, my friend. Goodbye! Can I give you a hug? Oh, right, I forgot it's not the English way.”",1
"""They were fast asleep at that point.” However, Poirot persisted in shaking his head, seemingly not fully convinced by the explanation. Pausing on the drive, he gazed at the house. “What prompted them to check if the front door was unlocked in the first place? It was highly unlikely that it would be. It would have been more logical for them to attempt to pry open a window.” “But all the windows on the ground floor are secured with iron shutters,” argued the commissary. Poirot gestured towards a window on the first floor. “Isn't that the window of the bedroom we just left? And look, there's a tree nearby that would provide easy access.” “Perhaps,” conceded the commissary. “But they couldn't have done it without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the validity of his point. There were two large oval flower-beds filled with scarlet geraniums, one on each side of the steps leading to the front door. The tree in question had its roots right behind the flower-bed, making it impossible to reach without stepping on it. “You see,” continued the commissary, “due to the dry weather, no footprints would be visible on the driveway or paths; however, on the soft soil of the flower-bed, it would have been a different story.” Poirot approached the bed and examined it closely. As Bex had mentioned, the soil was perfectly smooth. There wasn't a single print on it. Poirot nodded, seemingly convinced, and we moved on, but he suddenly veered off to inspect the other flower-bed. “M. Bex!” he exclaimed. “Look here. There are plenty of marks for you to see.” The commissary joined him and chuckled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are undoubtedly the footprints of the gardener's large boots. In any case, it wouldn't matter, as there is no tree on this side, and therefore no way to reach the upper floor.” “Indeed,” said Poirot, appearing disappointed. “So you believe these footprints are insignificant?” “Not at all.” To my surprise, Poirot proclaimed, “I disagree. I have a suspicion that these footprints are the most crucial clues we have encountered so far.” M. Bex remained silent, merely shrugging his shoulders. He was too polite to voice his true opinion. “Shall we continue?” he inquired instead. “Of course. I can look into the footprints later,” Poirot replied cheerfully. Instead of following the drive towards the gate, M. Bex veered onto a path that turned right at a right angle. It wound up a slight slope, curving to the right of the house, bordered by shrubbery on both sides. Suddenly, it opened up into a small clearing with a view of the sea. A bench was placed there, with a somewhat dilapidated shed nearby. A few steps ahead, a neat row of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed through them, and we found ourselves on a vast expanse of open downs.",1
"""But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I exclaimed. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, right?” “Yes, sir, but…” Poirot leaned in. “But what?” “M. Renauld was murdered this morning.” Poirot swiftly exited the car, his eyes filled with intensity. He grabbed the man by the shoulder. “What did you say? Murdered? When? How?” The police officer stood firm. “I cannot provide any answers, sir.” “Understood. I see.” Poirot pondered for a moment. “The Police Commissioner, he is inside?” “Yes, sir.” Poirot handed over a card, quickly jotting down a few words on it.",1
"Upon discovering that none of the station's staff had seen the arrival of a mysterious, black-bearded stranger on the night of the crime, it became evident that the murderer must have used a waiting car for a quick getaway. This very same vehicle was likely responsible for transporting the enigmatic housekeeper to her new place of employment. Subsequent investigations at the London Agency confirmed Poirot's suspicions, as no record of a ""Mrs. Middleton"" could be found in their archives. The involvement of this mysterious figure only added another layer of complexity to the case.",1
"""And had kept a close eye on her, especially when she was cleaning Madame’s room! Let those bumbling policemen search her, but they won’t find Madame’s pearls. Célestine spoke rapidly in French, punctuating her words with animated gestures, and the chambermaid understood her message. She flushed with anger. “That woman is accusing me of stealing the pearls, but it’s not true!” she protested vehemently. “I never even laid eyes on them.” “Go ahead, search her!” the woman shrieked. “You’ll see that I’m right.” “You’re a liar!” the chambermaid retorted, moving towards her aggressively.""",1
"""Just as I was starting to lose track of time, a barely audible scratching noise caught my attention. Poirot subtly signaled me and we silently made our way towards the hallway where the sound was originating. Poirot whispered to me, ""Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the signal, seize him from behind and restrain him. Watch out, he may be armed."" Soon enough, a tearing sound filled the air and a small beam of light pierced through the door.""",1
"I retrieved the keys and made my way to the Mill House, satisfied with my reconstructions thus far. The discrepancies between the man described by Mrs. James and my Tube ""doctor"" were merely superficial. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. Although the ""doctor"" seemed middle-aged, his movements hinted at youthfulness. The victim of the accident (whom I dubbed the Moth Ball man) and the foreign woman, Mrs. James, were the focus of my investigation.",1
"At the same time, if news of my getaway reached Chichester, along with the fact that I had departed Cape Town for Durban, it would be easy for him to disembark at Port Elizabeth or East London and evade me completely. It presented quite a dilemma. ""Let's look into train schedules for Durban regardless,"" I suggested. ""And there's still time for morning tea,"" added Suzanne. ""We can enjoy it in the lounge."" The train to Durban was scheduled for departure at 8:15 that night, as confirmed by the office. I held off on making a decision for now and joined Suzanne for a rather late ""eleven-o'clock tea.""",1
"“Excuse me, Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Please, have a seat. You got my message. I am determined to solve this puzzle. You can help me in some way. Let's start. You and a companion went to see the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th.” The Italian reacted angrily. “That never happened. I testified in court” “Exactly, and I suspect that you lied under oath.” “Are you trying to intimidate me? Ha! I have nothing to hide. I have been cleared of all charges.” “Indeed; and since I am not foolish, I am not threatening you with punishment but with exposure.",1
"As soon as I laid eyes on the lifeless body, a chilling resemblance to Jack sent shivers down my spine. Draped in Jack's elegant overcoat, the deceased also clutched the very same paper-knife he had gifted Bella. Odds were high that her fingerprints still lingered on its sharp edge. The sheer terror of the situation overwhelmed me, leaving me with only one clear thought - secure the dagger and disappear before its absence was noticed. Feigning a fainting spell, I seized the weapon while you fetched water, concealing it within the folds of my dress.",1
"His cohorts may have incapacitated him with a cloth and chloroform, but I fail to see what their goal was. He is unlikely to be of any help to them now, as he will be closely monitored until the situation with the Prime Minister is resolved. It's possible that he intended to mislead the police? However, he claims that something was placed over his nose and mouth, and he recalls nothing beyond that. This does not lead the investigation astray; it sounds remarkably truthful. Let's head to the station. France may reveal more clues. Although I have my doubts. It's astonishing that the Prime Minister hasn't been found in such a confined area. If the military and police of two nations haven't located him, how can I?",1
"I was surprised to find that she really was fond of me. I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. After recovering from our emotions, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you.""",1
"I couldn't believe the affection she showed towards me, it caught me off guard. She embraced me tightly, tears streaming down her face. After collecting ourselves, I sat down and recounted everything that had happened. ""You always had your suspicions about Colonel Race,"" she mused. ""I only started to doubt him the night you vanished. I actually thought he would be a suitable match for you. But how can you be certain that this young man is being truthful? You seem to believe every word he says."" ""I trust him completely,"" I responded defensively. ""But what is it about him that captivates you? I fail to see any outstanding qualities, apart from his daring appearance and unconventional ways."" I spent a few moments criticizing Suzanne, expressing my frustrations. ""You've become so content in your marriage that you've forgotten about romance,"" I concluded. ""I am not content in my marriage, Anne. The worry about you has taken a toll on me,"" Suzanne said sadly. ""You appear to be in good health,"" I replied coolly. ""You seem to have put on some weight."" ""And I'm not so sure about being happily married,"" Suzanne added in a despondent tone. She shared her troubles with her husband, Clarence, who was demanding her immediate return. After a while, she stopped responding to his messages, and now it had been two weeks since she heard from him. I didn't take Suzanne's marital issues seriously, as I was confident she could handle Clarence when the time came. The conversation shifted to the diamonds, and Suzanne explained her concerns. She had sent the large diamonds to Cape Town, under the care of Pagett, who would be joining Sir Eustace in Johannesburg. As for the smaller ones, Suzanne assumed Sir Eustace had them with him. I suggested we wait before taking any action. Suzanne smiled, noting my dislike for inactivity. I decided to check the train schedule to see when Pagett's train would pass through Kimberley. It was a crucial moment to meet with him, given the escalating situation in the Rand. The day was brightened by a telegram from Johannesburg, informing us of their safe arrival. Nothing could be done until I spoke to Pagett. Suzanne busied herself by sending a comforting message to Clarence. She expressed her longing for him, showing a side of affection that differed from mine and Harry's. ""I wish Clarence was here,"" she sobbed. ""It's been so long since I've seen him."" ""Here, have some face cream,"" I offered. Suzanne applied it delicately, mentioning her desire for more from Paris. She dreamt of Paris and longed for a nice hat. Suzanne asked to accompany me to meet Pagett, but I preferred to go alone. As a result, I stood at the hotel entrance the next afternoon, struggling with a stubborn parasol, while Suzanne relaxed in her room with a book and some fruit. The train arrived slightly late, with everyone bustling about on the platform. I spotted Pagett easily and approached him. He seemed startled to see me, but I wasted no time in asking him about his whereabouts on a particular date.",1
"“Just a bluff. No clue where she’s hiding.” “She sounded pretty sure.” “Probably. I’ve checked it out, we’re in the clear. And it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ call. You wouldn’t want to disobey, right?” The Dutchman muttered something in his native tongue. I assumed it was a quick denial. “Why not just get rid of her?” he snarled. “Easy enough. The boat is ready. We could take her out to sea?” “Agreed,” Chichester pondered. “That’s the way to go. She’s a liability, no doubt about it.",1
"Descending the stairway, with Léonie's support, Mrs. Renauld appeared, her head bandaged. The French girl was in tears, begging her mistress to go back to bed. “Madame, you will harm yourself. This goes against the doctor’s orders!” Despite the pleas, Mrs. Renauld continued. “Jack, my son,” called out Jack, moving towards her. But she pushed him away. “You are not my son! I disown you!” “Mother,” Jack said, shocked. She hesitated for a moment, touched by his pain. Poirot intervened, but she quickly regained her composure. “You bear responsibility for your father's death. Leave my house. Tomorrow, I will ensure you never inherit his fortune. Make your own way in the world with the daughter of your father's enemy.” With a slow and painful effort, she made her way back upstairs, leaving us all speechless. Jack, exhausted, almost collapsed. Poirot and I rushed to help him. “He is exhausted,” Poirot told Marthe. “Where should we take him?” “To our home, Villa Marguerite. We will care for him,” Marthe replied. We brought Jack to the Villa, where he sat down, looking dazed. Poirot checked his condition. “He has a fever. The strain is taking its toll. Let's get him to bed, and we will call a doctor,” Poirot decided. A doctor was summoned and diagnosed Jack with nerve strain. Rest was prescribed, with the warning that excitement could lead to brain fever. Marthe and her mother volunteered to stay up with him. After doing all we could, we left Jack in their care and headed to town, hungry and tired. Our meal at a nearby restaurant satisfied our hunger, and we secured rooms at Hôtel des Bains for the night. Poirot surprised me by inquiring about an English lady, Miss Robinson, who had arrived. “Yes, she is in the lounge,” we were told. Poirot hinted at a marriage arrangement for me with Miss Robinson, as we entered the room. It was Cinderella who greeted us. She handed Poirot an object wrapped in paper that I recognized as the aeroplane dagger she had thrown into the sea. “Well done, my child,” Poirot praised her. He instructed her to rest, while he and I had work to do. Poirot informed her that she would see me the next day. Despite objections, Cinderella insisted on joining us on our next venture. Twenty minutes later, we set off into the dark night, heading towards Villa Geneviève. As we passed Villa Marguerite, Poirot decided to check on Jack Renauld. Madame Daubreuil welcomed us and led us to Jack's room, where he was sleeping restlessly. Madame Daubreuil assured us that he was resting, and she had given him a herbal tea. As we left, I observed Marthe Daubreuil embroidering near a window. We left the house, intrigued by the mysterious circumstances surrounding Madame Daubreuil.",1
"“Shall we check in at our usual spot, the Hôtel des Bains?” Without hesitation, we headed over. The staff informed us that they had two available rooms with a view of the sea. Poirot then inquired about the arrival of an English lady named Miss Robinson. Turns out, she was in the small sitting room. As we walked down the corridor, I couldn't help but ask Poirot about Miss Robinson. His response? ""I have found you a wife, Hastings."" Shocked, I protested, but Poirot dismissed my concerns and ushered me into the room. And there she was, Cinderella herself, waiting to greet us.",1
"""But what about the crime passionnel? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head. “If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked men, the ‘secret,’ the papers!” Poirot smiled a little. “Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably. But reflect now on something very curious. It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale if it were all would indeed be plain sailing it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.” “Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “Mon ami, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to the facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason not like Giraud but like Hercule Poirot.” “But are you sure?” “My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile. But at last I see clearly.” “You know everything?” “I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.” “And you know the murderer?” “I know one murderer.” “What do you mean?” “We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but two. The first I have solved, the second eh bien, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was omniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.” “You don’t think ” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too horrible!” Poirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants there was, with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one man Jack Renauld. And a man must have dug a grave.… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad. “That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot. “There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you not to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an inkling of your errand.” “Very well, I will go straight to the station.” He rose to his feet. Poirot’s voice stopped him. “One moment, M. Renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me.""",1
"""Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?"" ""That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, cellela!"" The old woman tossed her head scornfully. ""Madame Daubreuil,"" murmured the commissary. ""Impossible."" ""Voilà,"" grumbled Françoise. ""That is all you get for telling the truth."" ""Not at all,"" said the examining magistrate soothingly. ""We were surprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were "" he paused delicately. ""Eh? It was that without doubt?"" ""How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was milor anglais trés riche and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one and trés chic for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but ma foi! I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end."" And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. ""And Madame Renauld?"" he asked at length. ""How did she take this friendship."" Françoise shrugged her shoulders. ""She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!"" I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. ""You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?"" ""Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her."" ""What time was that?"" ""About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur."" ""Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?"" ""I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down."" ""And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?"" ""Nothing whatever, monsieur."" ""Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?"" ""I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open."" ""What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?"" ""Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere."" ""Good, Françoise, you can go."" The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. ""I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that."" And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. ""Léonie Oulard,"" called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. ""Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed."" But Denise had her own theory. ""Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!"" ""It is, of course, possible,"" said the magistrate smoothly. ""Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?"" ""Not last night, monsieur, the night before."" ""But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?"" ""No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil."" Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. ""Had you ever seen this lady before?"" ""Never, monsieur."" And then the girl added diffidently: ""But I think she was English."" ""English?"" ""Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English."" ""Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?"" ""Me, I speak the English very well,"" said Denise with pride. ""The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her."" She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: ""‘Yeas yeas butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’"" ""Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!"" repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, voilà tout! So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. ""You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly."" The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",1
"I am completely agitated. The dreadful breakfast I had was accompanied by dreadful company. Slow Dutch waitresses served me subpar fish after making me wait. The ordeal of waking up at 5 a.m. to see a doctor upon arrival at the port is exhausting. But now, a serious issue has arisen. I presented Milray’s sealed letter to the Prime Minister, only to find a blank sheet inside. Pagett, a constant source of annoyance, seems pleased by my predicament. Despite my reluctance, I had to entertain his theory about Rayburn. The situation is escalating, and I am eager to leave for Rhodesia. I have made it clear to Pagett that he will not be joining me on this journey. My reputation as an English Member of Parliament is at stake.",1
"""In that instant of frigid rationality, I berated myself for being overly theatrical, longing for the quiet monotony of Smallington. These thoughts raced through my mind in a mere moment. Instinctively, I inched backwards, searching for the door handle. The man holding me captive smirked. ""You're here now, and here you will remain,"" he said jokingly. Trying to appear brave, I stated, ""I was brought here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.""",1
"""Bravo!"" he whispered. ""May I have a look, madame?"" He examined the gem closely in his own hand before handing it back with a slight bow. ""A flawless and magnificent stone. Oh, my word! and you carry it around with you, like that!"" ""No, no, I'm usually very cautious, Monsieur Poirot. Normally, it's locked away in my jewelry box, kept in the hotel safe deposit box. We're staying at the Grand, you know. I just brought it today for you to admire."" ""And you'll leave it with me, won't you? You'll take advice from Papa Poirot?""""Well, you see, Monsieur Poirot, the thing is, on Friday we are heading to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly."" Her words triggered a faint memory in my mind. Wasn't there some gossip...? A few years back, Lord and Lady Yardly had visited the States, and there were rumors that his lordship had indulged in some questionable activities with certain ladies out there. But there was something else, some rumor linking Lady Yardly's name with a Hollywood star in California... it hit me in an instant - Gregory B. Rolf.""I'll share a little secret with you, Monsieur Poirot,"" Miss Marvell continued. ""We're in talks with Lord Yardly for a potential filming project in his ancestral home.""""At Yardly Chase?"" I interjected, intrigued. ""It's one of England's top attractions.""Miss Marvell nodded. ""It's full of old-world charm for sure. But he's asking for a hefty price, and we're not sure yet if the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to mix business with pleasure.""""But forgive my ignorance, madame, isn't it possible to visit Yardly Chase without bringing the diamond with you?"" A sharp, calculating look appeared in Miss Marvell's eyes, contradicting her innocent facade. She suddenly seemed much older. ""I want to wear it there,"" she stated firmly.""Of course,"" I remarked, ""there are some famous jewels in the Yardly collection, including a large diamond, right?""""That's correct,"" replied Miss Marvell, shortly. Poirot muttered softly to himself: ""Ah, that's how it is!"" Then he said aloud, with his usual knack for hitting the mark (he calls it psychology): ""So you must already be acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?""""Gregory knew her when she visited the West three years ago,"" Miss Marvell revealed. She paused, then blurted out: ""Do either of you read Society Gossip?""We both admitted somewhat sheepishly. ""I ask because this week's issue has an article on famous jewels, and it's quite intriguing,"" she added. I got up, fetched the magazine from the other side of the room, and handed it to her. She found the article and began to read aloud: ""...Among other notable stones is the Star of the East, a diamond belonging to the Yardly family. An ancestor of the current Lord Yardly brought it back from China, and there's a romantic tale associated with it..."" ""Bravo!"" Poirot exclaimed. ""Undoubtedly a tale of the highest caliber."" He turned to Mary Marvell. ""Are you not afraid, madame? No superstitions? No fears of introducing these two 'Siamese twins' to each other only to have a Chinaman appear and whisk them back to China?""""I don't think Lady Yardly's diamond is anywhere near as good as mine,"" said Miss Marvell. ""But I want to find out.""",1
"I couldn't see into the passage from where I sat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She let out a long shriek as she turned to him. ""You saw him there in the passage?"" she exclaimed. He was staring down at her with a puzzled expression, then shook his head. ""I saw him, my husband, you must have seen him too?"" ""Madame, I saw nothing. You are not well, unstrung."" ""I am perfectly well, Oh, God!"" Suddenly, without any warning, the lights flickered and went out. Out of the darkness came three loud knocks. I could hear Mrs. Maltravers moaning. And then I saw! The man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us, gleaming with a faint ghostly light. There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to emanate from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! ""My God, Poirot!"" I exclaimed. ""Look at her hand, her right hand. It's all red!"" Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. ""Blood,"" she cried hysterically. ""Yes, it's blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him, save me! He's come back!"" Her voice faded into a gurgle. ""Lights,"" said Poirot briskly. The lights came on as if by magic. ""That's it,"" he continued. ""You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I 'phoned him this afternoon. His makeup is good, isn't it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence, he made the proper impression. I shouldn't touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out, I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn't miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window. A bad night, but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then."" ""You see,"" continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, ""there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us, she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretense of mourning for her husband, I do not care for such heavily rouged eyelids! You did not observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see nothing!"" ""Well, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black's story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally ingenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter view. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from someone. An odd detail like that would have been remembered. ""No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played tonight."" ""Even now I don't quite see all the details of the crime?"" I said. ""Let us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband's financial debacle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that the young soldier's strange story. The next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. 'What a curious story that was last night!' she observes. 'Could a man shoot himself in such a way? Do show me if it is possible!' The poor fool he shows her. He places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and puts her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. 'And now, sir,' she says saucily, 'supposing I pull the trigger?' ""And then and then, Hastings she pulls it!"" So far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot's investigations have started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unraveling. In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot's attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case. I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker's special hobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker's.",1
"She hopped onto the train at the very last moment, gasping for breath as if she had just finished a marathon, yet Pagett claimed he saw her boarding a train to Durban the previous night! Either Pagett was intoxicated once again or the girl must have a supernatural presence. And she never offers any explanation. No one ever does. Ah, the ""Secretaries I have encountered."" The first, a fugitive murderer on the run. The second, a hidden drinker involved in scandalous affairs in Italy. The third, a stunning woman with the uncanny ability to be in two places simultaneously.",1
"Poirot calmly explained the intricate plan that M. Renauld had devised, ensuring that he would appear to die without actually perishing. The body of the tramp was manipulated to serve as a decoy, while M. Renauld planned to escape to another country under an assumed identity. Madame Renauld was to play the part of the grieving widow until they could reunite in secret. The details were meticulously arranged, from altering the will to staging the body with the aeroplane dagger. The truth behind the elaborate scheme was slowly unraveling, revealing the extent of their desperation and determination to start anew.",1
"""As Graves feared being caught eavesdropping, he quickly went to carry out his employer's task. The two men had arrived promptly at eight that evening. Over dinner, they engaged in casual conversation about politics, weather, and the theater. After serving port and coffee, Graves' master unexpectedly granted him the rest of the evening off. The inspector inquired if this was a common occurrence with guests, to which Graves replied, 'No, sir; it was not.'""",1
"The accusation was outrageous! To think that she would be implicated in stealing from Madame! The authorities were notoriously incompetent! However, Monsieur, a Frenchman ""A Belgian,"" Poirot interjected, but Célestine ignored the correction. Monsieur refused to let her be wrongly blamed, especially when that scandalous chambermaid was walking free. She always distrusted her, a brazen, rosy-cheeked woman, clearly a thief. From the beginning, she had a feeling that she was untrustworthy.",1
"I arrived at the Villa Medgee after a challenging search. The people arrived on the waves on short curved boards. It was too early for tea, so I headed to the bathing pavilion. When offered a surf board, I eagerly accepted. Surfing seemed simple at first glance, but I quickly learned otherwise. Despite my initial frustration, I was determined to try again. Eventually, I caught a good wave and felt pure joy. Surfing has a way of bringing out strong emotions. Whether cursing vigorously or feeling foolishly proud, the experience is always intense.",1
"""I don't understand why she would lie. She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men, and she lied about something else. So, Hastings, what's your take on the open door?"" ""Well,"" I responded, feeling a bit uneasy, ""I think it was just a mistake. Someone must have forgotten to close it."" Poirot shook his head, looking disappointed. ""That's what Giraud thinks. But I'm not convinced. There's a deeper meaning to that open door that eludes me for now."" ""Wait, I might have a theory,"" I exclaimed suddenly. ""Well, let's hear it then."" ""Consider this. We both know that Mrs. Renauld's version of events is false. Could it be that Mr.",1
"I noticed my pencil resting against the closed cupboard door. It struck me that had the door been open, my pencil would have surely found its way inside. Intrigued, I opened the door, allowing the pencil to escape into the shadows of the far corner. As I reached for it, I realized that the dim light and odd structure of the cupboard made it nearly impossible to spot the pencil without touch. Satisfied with the retrieval, I decided to check the cupboard beneath the window on the other side of the room.",1
"""Don't fear me, Bella. Please, don't fear me. I do love you, that's the truth, but I don't expect anything in return. Just allow me to assist you. If you must, continue to love him, but let me be there for you in ways he cannot."" Her reaction was as if she had been petrified by my words. Looking up from her hands, she gazed at me. ""You really believe that?"" she murmured. ""You truly believe that I care for Jack Renauld?"" Then, with a mixture of laughter and tears, she embraced me tightly, burying her face against mine. ""Not in the way I love you,"" she whispered.",1
"Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair greeted me warmly, prompting me to approach them. The conversation revolved around Italy. “It’s deceptive,” Mrs. Blair argued. “Aqua calda should definitely mean cold water, not hot.” “You’re not a Latin expert,” Sir Eustace teased, grinning. “Men always act so superior when it comes to Latin,” Mrs. Blair remarked. “Yet, I can't help but notice that when asked to translate inscriptions in old churches, they often struggle! They stumble over words and find ways to avoid it.” “Absolutely,” agreed Colonel Race. “That's my tactic.” “Regardless, I have a soft spot for the Italians,” Mrs. Blair added.",1
"""He doesn't have much going against him, besides the mystery surrounding his background and his proficiency in numerous languages, which is unusual for an Englishman. (Excuse my bluntness, but your linguistic abilities are truly lacking!) As for the victim, he was discovered gagged, tied up, and under the influence of chloroform, indicating he may not have been involved in the crime."" Poirot dismissed the idea. ""The French authorities would not overlook such a detail. Additionally, once he achieved his goal of abducting the Prime Minister, there would be no reason for him to stick around.""",1
"As he took a step back, he seemed to involuntarily retreat from an unseen threat, unaware that he was teetering on the edge of the platform. In an instant, he tumbled over the side. A bright flash emanated from the tracks followed by a sharp crackling noise, prompting a scream to escape my lips. The commotion drew a crowd as two station employees swiftly appeared, assuming control of the situation. I stood frozen in place, held captive by a chilling sense of intrigue.",1
"""Monsieur le juge, he died of an epileptic fit, if I am not mistaken,"" declared Poirot, causing a stir. Dr. Durand conducted a thorough examination and then stood up. ""So, Doctor?"" inquired Poirot. ""I must agree with you, Monsieur Poirot. I was initially misled by the stabbing, but now I see the truth,"" admitted Dr. Durand. Poirot basked in the praise, becoming the center of attention. The examining magistrate showered him with compliments.",1
"Suzanne looked at me with a mixture of excitement and determination. ""Anne, we're onto something big here,"" she said. ""Nadina, the diamonds, Colonel Race...it's all connected."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the implications of her words. This was no ordinary mystery we were unraveling. Suzanne leaned in closer, her eyes gleaming with anticipation. ""We need to dig deeper, Anne. There's more to this than meets the eye."" With a newfound sense of purpose, I nodded in agreement. It was time to uncover the truth behind the tangled web of secrets that lay before us.",1
"“I suspect you’ll be attending,” I stated icily. “It is quite possible. Perhaps we will journey together.” “I’m contemplating staying a while longer at the Falls,” I replied vaguely. Why is Race so insistent that I go to Jo’burg? I think he has his eyes on Anne. “What are your intentions, Miss Anne?” “That remains to be seen,” she responded coyly, mimicking me. “I thought you were my secretary,” I protested. “Oh, but I seem to have been replaced. You’ve been rather occupied with Miss Pettigrew this afternoon.” “Regardless of what I’ve been doing, I can assure you it wasn’t that,” I reassured her. Thursday evening. We have just departed from Kimberley. Race was compelled to recount the tale of the diamond theft once more. Why are women so captivated by anything related to diamonds? Finally, Anne Beddingfeld has revealed her true identity. It turns out she is a journalist. She sent a lengthy cable from De Aar this morning. From the incessant chatter that persisted throughout the night in Mrs. Blair’s cabin, it appears she must have been reading aloud all her exclusive articles for years to come. It seems that all this time she has been tracking down “The Man in the Brown Suit.” Apparently she didn’t spot him on the Kilmorden_in fact, she barely had the opportunity, but she is now busy sending home cables: “My Journey with the Murderer,” and fabricating highly imaginative tales of “What he said to me,” etc. I understand how these things work. I do it myself in my Memoirs when Pagett permits me. And naturally one of Nasby’s efficient team will embellish the details even further, so when it appears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won’t even recognize himself. The girl is clever, though. All on her own, it seems, she has uncovered the identity of the woman who was killed in my residence. She was a Russian dancer named Nadina. I inquired of Anne Beddingfeld if she was certain of this. She replied that it was merely an inference done in the Sherlock Holmes style. However, it seems she had cabled it as fact to Nasby. Women possess these intuitions. I have no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is correct in her assumption but to label it a deduction is ridiculous. How she managed to secure a position at the Daily Budget is beyond me. But she is the type of young woman who accomplishes such feats. Impossible to resist her. She is full of alluring ways that mask an indomitable resolve. Look at how she has infiltrated my private car! I am starting to grasp why. Race mentioned something about the police suspecting that Rayburn might head to Rhodesia. He might have slipped away on Monday’s train. They telegraphed along the entire line, I presume, and no one fitting his description was found, but that means little. He’s a cunning young man and he knows Africa. He’s probably cleverly disguised as an old Kafir woman and the naive police officers are still searching for a handsome young man with a scar, dressed in the latest European fashion. I never entirely believed that scar. Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his trail. She desires the glory of apprehending him herself and for the Daily Budget. Young women are quite ruthless these days. I hinted to her that it was an unbecoming action. She laughed at me. She assured me that if she tracks him down, her fortune is made. Race does not approve, I can tell. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may all meet our demise in our sleep. I mentioned this to Mrs. Blair but she seemed to welcome the notion, commenting that if I were killed it would be a sensational scoop for Anne! A scoop for Anne indeed! Tomorrow we will be passing through Bechuanaland. The dust will be unbearable. Additionally, at every stop, little Kafir children come to sell you charming wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also, mealie bowls and baskets. I am somewhat concerned that Mrs. Blair may go overboard. There is a primitive allure about these toys that I suspect will appeal to her. Friday night. As I anticipated. Mrs. Blair and Anne have purchased forty-nine wooden animals! (Anne’s Narrative Continued) I immensely enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia. There was something novel and thrilling to behold each day. First the breathtaking landscapes of the Hex river valley, then the desolate magnificence of the Karoo, and finally that remarkable straight stretch of track in Bechuanaland, and the utterly charming toys the locals brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly stranded at each stop, if you could call them that. It seemed to me that the train just halted whenever it pleased, and as soon as it did, a crowd of locals emerged from the barren landscape, displaying mealie bowls, sugar canes, fur karosses, and enchanting carved wooden animals. Suzanne immediately began collecting the latter. I followed suit most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was unique. There were giraffes, tigers, snakes, a forlorn eland, and amusing little black warriors. We had an absolute blast. Sir Eustace attempted to restrain us but to no avail. I find it miraculous that we were not abandoned at some oasis along the line. South African trains don’t sound their horns or show any signs of departure. They simply glide away, and you must hastily make your way back on board. Suzanne’s astonishment at witnessing me clamber onto the train at Cape Town can be imagined. We conducted a thorough assessment of the situation on the first night. We conversed well into the night. It became evident to me that defensive measures must be taken in addition to offensive ones. Traveling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his entourage, I felt relatively secure. Both he and Colonel Race were formidable protectors, and I surmised that my adversaries would be reluctant to provoke a conflict. Moreover, as long as I was in close proximity to Sir Eustace, I was somewhat connected to Guy Pagett and Guy Pagett was at the core of the mystery. I inquired of Suzanne whether she believed it was plausible that Pagett himself was the enigmatic “Colonel.” His subordinate status was a mark against the theory, but I had occasionally considered that, despite his autocratic demeanor, Sir Eustace was greatly influenced by his secretary. He was an amiable man, and one whom a clever secretary might be able to manipulate. The obscurity of his position might actually be advantageous to him, as he would likely prefer to remain out of the spotlight. However, Suzanne vehemently rejected these notions. She refused to entertain the idea that Guy Pagett was the mastermind. The true leader the “Colonel” was lurking in the shadows and had probably been in Africa at the time of our arrival. I acknowledged that there was merit to her perspective, but I remained unconvinced. In each incriminating instance, Pagett had been depicted as the guiding force. It was true that his demeanor seemed to lack the confidence and decisiveness one would expect from a criminal mastermind but according to Colonel Race, it was intellectual prowess alone that this mysterious leader provided, and creative brilliance is often coupled with a feeble and timid physical constitution. ""There goes the Professor's daughter,"" interrupted Suzanne, when I reached this point in my argument. “It’s true, nonetheless. On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I fell silent for a moment or two, then continued thoughtfully: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace amassed his wealth!” “Doubting him once more?” “Suzanne, I’ve reached a point where I can’t help but suspect someone! I don’t truly suspect him but, after all, he is Pagett’s employer, and he did own the Mill House.” “I’ve always heard that he earned his fortune in a manner he prefers not to discuss,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “But that doesn’t necessarily imply criminal activity it could be tin-tacks or hair restorer!” I concurred ruefully. “I suppose,” said Suzanne hesitantly, “that we’re not pursuing a false lead? Completely misled, I mean, by assuming Pagett’s involvement? What if, after all, he is a perfectly honest man?” I pondered that for a moment or two, then shook my head. “I can’t bring myself to believe that.” “After all, he has explanations for everything.” “Yes, but they’re not very convincing. For instance, the night he attempted to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden, he claims he followed Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and struck him. Now we know that’s untrue.” “No,” said Suzanne reluctantly. “But we only heard the account second-hand from Sir Eustace. If we had heard it directly from Pagett himself, it might have been different. You know how stories tend to get slightly distorted when they are retold.” I contemplated the matter. “No,” I finally stated, “I don’t see any alternative. Pagett is culpable. You cannot overlook the fact that he tried to throw me overboard, and everything else aligns. Why are you so insistent on this new notion of yours?” “Because of his countenance?” “His countenance? But” “Yes, I know what you’re about to say. It’s a menacing countenance. That’s precisely it. No man with a visage like that could truly be menacing. It must be a colossal jest on the part of Nature.” I did not place much credence in Suzanne’s argument. I possess a wealth of knowledge about Nature in bygone eras. If she possesses a sense of humor, she doesn’t exhibit it often. Suzanne is precisely the type of individual who would attribute all her own qualities to Nature. We transitioned to discussing our immediate plans. It was apparent to me that I needed to establish some sort of credibility. I couldn’t continue avoiding explanations indefinitely. The solution to all my predicaments was readily available, though it didn’t occur to me for some time. The Daily Budget! My silence or my speech would no longer impact Harry Rayburn. He was identified as “The Man in the Brown Suit” through no fault of mine. I could assist him most effectively by appearing to oppose him. The “Colonel” and his associates must remain unaware that there was any amicable sentiment between me and the man they had singled out to be the scapegoat for the murder at Marlow. As far as I knew, the deceased woman was still unidentified. I would telegram Lord Nasby, proposing that she was none other than the renowned Russian dancer “Nadina” who had been captivating audiences in Paris for so long. It seemed inconceivable to me that she had not been identified already but when I learned more about the case later on, I understood how plausible it truly was. Nadina had never visited England during her successful stint in Paris. She was unknown to London audiences. The images in the newspapers of the Marlow victim were so blurry and unrecognizable that it is no surprise no one identified her. And, on the contrary, Nadina had kept her plans to visit England a closely guarded secret from everyone. The day after the murder, a letter had been received by her manager purportedly from the dancer, in which she stated that she was returning to Russia due to urgent personal matters and that he must handle her breached contract as best as he could. All this, naturally, I discovered later. With Suzanne’s enthusiastic concurrence, I sent a lengthy telegram from De Aar. It arrived at a crucial juncture (this, too, I learned afterwards). The Daily Budget was in dire need of a sensation. My hunch was confirmed and validated and the Daily Budget secured the story of a lifetime. “Victim of the Mill House Murder identified by our intrepid reporter.” And so forth. “Our reporter travels with the perpetrator. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ A closer look at his true nature.” The essential details were, of course, cabled to the South African papers, but I only perused my own extensive articles much later! I received approval and detailed instructions via telegram at Bulawayo. I was now part of the Daily Budget team, and I received a private message of congratulations from Lord Nasby himself. I was officially tasked with tracking down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But for the time being, let the world believe that it was him best so. We reached Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was underwhelmed by the place. It was sweltering, and I despised the hotel. Additionally, Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly disgruntled. I believe it was our wooden animals that irritated him, especially the large giraffe. It was a gigantic giraffe with an implausible neck, a placid gaze, and a drooping tail. It had character. It had appeal. A dispute was already brewing as to whom it belonged to me or Suzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne asserted her claim based on seniority and marital status, while I insisted that I had been the first to behold its splendor. In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a significant portion of our three-dimensional space. To transport forty-nine wooden animals, all of unwieldy shape and exceedingly fragile wood, posed quite a challenge. Two porters carried a bundle of animals each, and one promptly dropped a charming group of ostriches, breaking their heads off. In light of this, Suzanne and I carried as many as we could, Colonel Race assisted, and I thrust the large giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Even the prim Miss Pettigrew did not escape a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a sense that Miss Pettigrew did not hold me in high regard. Perhaps she thought I was audacious. Regardless, she avoided me as much as possible. And oddly enough, her countenance seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We rested for most of the morning, and in the afternoon we ventured out to the Matoppos to visit Rhodes’s grave. Or rather, we were supposed to, but at the last minute Sir Eustace backed out. He was nearly as irritable as the morning we arrived in Cape Town when he dropped the peaches on the floor and they splattered! Apparently, arriving early in the morning at places does not agree with his temperament.",1
"""I’d rather be dead than tough,” I exclaimed fervently. We entered the vehicle and set off. I gradually composed myself again. Unexpectedly, to my great surprise, he grasped my hand. “Anne,” he said softly, “I desire you. Will you wed me?” I was completely caught off guard. “Oh, no,” I stuttered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t have feelings for you in that way. I’ve never viewed you in that light.” “I understand. Is that the only reason?” I had to be truthful. I owed it to him. “No,” I replied, “it is not. You see I have feelings for someone else.” “I see,” he said once more. “And was that true in the beginning when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?” “No,” I murmured. “It was since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a determined tone in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His expression was more severe than I had ever seen it. “What do you mean?” I faltered. He gazed at me, unreadable, commanding. “Only that I now know what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver down my spine. There was a resolve behind them that I did not comprehend and it scared me. We both stayed silent until we reached the hotel. I went straight to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not appear to be suffering from a headache. “Here lies the perfect gooseberry,” she commented. “Also known as the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s wrong?” For I had burst into tears. I confided in her about the cats but felt it was unfair to tell her about Colonel Race. However, Suzanne is very perceptive. I believe she sensed that there was more to the story. “You haven’t caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds ridiculous even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep shivering.” “It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves or a feeling that something terrible is going to happen.” “Don’t be foolish,” stated Suzanne, firmly. “Let’s talk about something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was fine before, no one would suspect they were among my things. But now that everyone knows we’re such good friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re concealed in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a fantastic hiding spot and I don’t think we could find a better one.” She agreed uncertainly, but suggested we revisit the topic when we arrived at the Falls. Our train departed at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s mood was still far from pleasant, and Miss Pettigrew appeared subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt as though the entire conversation on the way back had been a dream. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, wrestling with vague, menacing dreams. I woke up with a headache and went out to the observation platform of the car. It was cool and beautiful, with undulating wooded hills as far as the eye could see. I adored it, loved it more than any other place I had ever been. I wished then that I could have a small hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there forever. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist hanging over a section of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he explained. “We are almost there.” I was still enveloped in that strange sense of elation that followed my troubled night. There was a strong feeling within me that I had arrived home. Home! And yet I had never been here before or had I in dreams? We walked from the train to the hotel, a large white building tightly secured against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We stepped out onto the veranda and I gasped. There, half a mile away, directly in front of us, were the Falls. I’ve never seen anything so magnificent and beautiful I never will. “Anne, you’re fey,” remarked Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch. “I’ve never seen you like this before.” She stared at me intently. “Am I?” I laughed, but it felt forced. “It’s just that I love it all.” “It’s more than that.” A slight frown appeared on her forehead, one of apprehension. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the strange sensation that I was expecting something something that would occur soon. I was excited, restless. After tea, we took a stroll, boarded the trolley, and were pushed by smiling locals down the small rail tracks to the bridge. It was a marvelous sight, the vast chasm and the rushing waters below, with a veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted occasionally to reveal the cascade of water before closing up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to me, has always been the allure of the Falls their elusive nature. You always think you’re about to see it and you never do. We crossed the bridge and leisurely walked along the path marked with white stones on each side, leading around the edge of the gorge. Finally, we reached a large clearing where a path descended towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until tomorrow? It will take a while, and it’s quite a climb back up.” “We’ll save it for tomorrow,” decided Sir Eustace. He doesn’t seem to enjoy strenuous physical activity, from what I’ve observed. He led the way back. As we passed, we encountered a tall native man. Following him was a woman who appeared to have the entire household items balanced on her head! Among the items was a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I need it,” lamented Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will present itself often enough, Mrs. Blair,” remarked Colonel Race. “So don’t despair.” We returned to the bridge. “Shall we enter the rainbow forest?” he proposed. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I joined him. Sir Eustace returned to the hotel. I found the rainbow forest rather disappointing. There weren’t nearly enough rainbows, and we got drenched, but every now and then we caught a glimpse of the Falls across from us and realized how incredibly wide they were.",1
"Upon our return to London, my eyes were drawn to a striking foxhound figurine displayed proudly on Poirot's mantelpiece. Poirot confirmed my unspoken question with a nod. ""Ah, yes! I have received my 500 francs! Isn't he magnificent? I have christened him Giraud!"" A few days passed before Jack Renauld visited us, his countenance determined. ""M. Poirot, I bid you farewell. I am setting sail for South America imminently. My father had extensive business dealings on the continent, and I am eager to forge a new path there."" ""Will you be traveling alone, M. Jack?"" ""My mother accompanies me, and Stonor will remain as my secretary.""",1

Can you picture the dire circumstances she found herself in?"" ""And what did she do?"" I asked, my curiosity piqued. ""Luckily, her husband was a practical man. He remained remarkably composed, unaffected by her nerve-wracking crises.""",1
"He once again dodged as the lion leaped over him. This scenario repeated twice more before he reached the tent's entrance, where he grabbed his rifle. Upon reemerging with rifle in hand, the lion was nowhere to be seen, leaving him perplexed. Moving cautiously to the rear of the tent, he discovered the lion in a small clearing, practicing low jumps. The audience erupted in cheers as I sipped my champagne. ""On a different note,"" I interjected, ""my acquaintance encountered another peculiar situation.""",1
"""Isn't it rather the case of you being here without him, like a cart without a horse?"" His ill-timed jest lingered in the air as I made my way to the house.

The events of last night unfolded in her retelling - a mysterious man, a shot, and Mr. Pace left bleeding. The man with the black beard had vanished through the window before help arrived. Mrs. Havering was informed of my presence and descended the stairs promptly. Her vibrant presence was undeniable, even in the midst of tragedy. I introduced myself and she nodded in understanding.",1

""It was him who divulged the 'Colonel's' secrets to Suzanne, detailing his escapades in Paris."" ""A masterful deception,"" she mused. ""But where does Pagett fit into this puzzle? Is he a pawn of Race?"" ""Possibly,"" Harry pondered, ""or perhaps Pagett is playing a game of his own."" ""What?"" ""Recall, Anne. Have you ever heard Pagett's version of the events at Kilmorden?"" ""Only through Sir Eustace,"" she replied, recounting the tale. Harry absorbed every word with keen interest.",1
"I discovered a wireless message sent to Nadina from someone on the Kilmorden, either Carton or Rayburn. The message read 'Seventeen one twenty two,' which I interpreted as an appointment with Rayburn. Pretending to believe Rayburn's lies, I allowed him to board the ship in order to keep a close eye on him. However, my investigation was interrupted by Minks, who was trying to go behind my back. I quickly put a stop to that, and he fell back in line.",1
"""I have my suspicions about Guy Pagett and his time in Florence,"" said Sir Eustace, watching his secretary's hasty departure. ""Every time Italy comes up, he's out the door before you can blink."" ""Maybe he's got a murder or two under his belt from his days there,"" Mrs. Blair chimed in optimistically. ""I hate to say it, Sir Eustace, but he does have that look about him."" ""Oh, definitely a classic Cinquecento villain! It's quite amusing really, especially knowing how law-abiding and decent he actually is,"" Sir Eustace replied. ""He's been by your side for quite a while now, hasn't he, Sir Eustace?"" Colonel Race inquired.",1
"""I remember the purser assuring me that cabin."" ""Pursers are always so preoccupied, don't you think?"" I replied vaguely. ""They're bound to overlook things from time to time."" Mr. Chichester remained silent. ""Is this your initial journey to Africa?"" I asked casually. ""To South Africa, yes. However, I've spent the past couple of years among the cannibal tribes in the heart of East Africa."" ""How exciting! Have you encountered many close calls?"" ""Close calls?"" ""Of being devoured, I mean?"" ""You shouldn't joke about such serious matters, Miss Beddingfeld.""",1
"""Excuse me, sir, but was that a usual habit of his?” “No, it was not, however, old Françoise holds the common belief about the English being eccentric and capable of unpredictable actions! While going to fetch her mistress, a younger maid, Léonie, was shocked to find her tied up and gagged, and at the same time, news arrived that M. Renauld’s lifeless body had been found, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most bizarre aspects of the situation. Mr. Poirot, the body was discovered lying face down in an open grave.""",1
"""And their offspring behaved much like children do today, amusing themselves with handfuls of pebbles, stacking them and then toppling them over. The more skillfully they stacked the stones, the more delighted they were. If I were to label this area, I would dub it ‘The Land of Oversized Children.’"" ""You may be closer to the truth than you realize,"" Colonel Race remarked solemnly. ""Uncomplicated, basic, vast that is Africa."" I nodded in agreement. ""You have a fondness for it, don't you?"" I inquired. ""Indeed. However, residing in it for an extended period well, it instills a sense of what you might consider ruthlessness.""",1
"The detective adjusted his tie, fixing his gaze on my companion in a playful manner. “You don’t see eye to eye with me, do you? So, what aspect of the case stands out to you? I’m all ears.” “There is something that strikes me as significant. Tell me, Mr. Smith, does anything about this case ring a bell? Does it not remind you of something?” “Ring a bell? Remind me of something? I can’t think of anything at the moment. I don’t believe so, though.” “You are mistaken,” remarked Holmes calmly. “A crime very much like this one has occurred in the past.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, regrettably, escapes me at present but I will soon recall it.”",1
"""Pagett devoured it like a hungry wolf."" ""You're refreshingly honest,"" I remarked, observing him closely. ""There's no reason for me not to be."" I found his response unsettling. Quickly, I offered my own interpretation. ""You have faith in the success of this Rebellion? You've burned your bridges."" ""For a supposedly intelligent young lady, that's a remarkably foolish comment. No, my dear, I have no faith in this Rebellion. I predict it will fizzle out disgracefully in a matter of days."" ""So, not a triumph for you then?"" I retorted. ""Like most women, you have no grasp of business. My task was to provide specific explosives and weapons at a high price to stir up sentiments, and to implicate certain individuals completely. I have fulfilled my part of the deal with great success, and I made sure to receive payment upfront. I executed the entire plan meticulously, as I intended it to be my final assignment before retiring. As for burning bridges, as you say, I am at a loss. I am not the leader of the rebels, or anything of the sort. I am a distinguished English visitor who, unfortunately, stumbled upon a certain curiosity shop and witnessed more than I should have, leading to my abduction. Soon, when circumstances allow, I will be discovered bound and in a pitiful state of fear and hunger."" ""Ah,"" I murmured. ""But what about me?"" ""That's the question,"" Sir Eustace replied softly. ""What about you? I have you here I don't wish to be blunt, but I have you here quite securely. The question remains, what shall I do with you? The easiest and, I dare say, the most agreeable solution for me is marriage. Wives cannot testify against their husbands, you see, and I fancy a lovely young wife to hold my hand and gaze at me with adoring eyes don't glare at me like that! You frighten me. I see that my proposition does not appeal to you?"" ""It does not."" Sir Eustace sighed. ""A shame! But I am not a melodramatic villain. Likely a matter of the heart, I assume. You are in love with another, as the novels suggest."" ""I am in love with another."" ""I suspected as much at first I thought it was that tall, pompous fool, Race, but now I suppose it's the young hero who rescued you from the rapids that night. Women have peculiar tastes. Neither of them possess even half the intelligence that I do. I am often underestimated."" I had to admit, he was correct in that assessment. Despite being aware of the type of man he was and the atrocities he had committed, I couldn't bring myself to see him in the light he deserved. He had attempted to end my life on multiple occasions, he had even murdered another woman, and he was accountable for numerous other crimes of which I was unaware, yet I couldn't shake the image of him as our entertaining, amiable fellow traveler. I couldn't muster any fear towards him, even though I knew he was capable of ordering my execution without a second thought if it served his purposes.",1
"I recall the man who had pretended to be Sir Eustace. He was sly, but charming in his own way. Colonel Race was determined to see justice served, though I had my doubts. The man had a network of spies and a well-planned escape route. Despite my lukewarm response, the conversation shifted to Harry's innocence. Colonel Race revealed Harry's true identity, leaving me stunned. Harry confessed his deception, fearing my reaction. As I processed his story, discrepancies emerged. He explained the tragic fate of his friend Lucas and the reasons for his deception. Harry's true motives were finally laid bare, leaving me conflicted. I couldn't help but feel a pang of regret that the truth had come to light.",1
"""But all my efforts would have been futile if I had attended. The same goes for those who claim to be 'experts.' Look at the handwriting analysis in the Cavendish Case. One lawyer’s interrogation reveals similarities, while the defense presents evidence of differences. It’s all very technical. And the outcome? Simply confirming what we already suspected. The writing closely resembled that of John Cavendish. And now the mind is left pondering 'Why?' Was it truly his handwriting? Or was someone trying to mislead us? I have unraveled that mystery, my friend, and I have done so accurately."" With that, Poirot, having effectively silenced me, if not entirely convinced, reclined in his chair with an air of contentment.",1
"In the hallway, Giraud faced Poirot, announcing the arrest of Jack Renauld for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld. Poirot, stunned by Jack's lack of defense, followed Giraud into the salon for an explanation. Giraud outlined his case, pointing to Jack's motive and means, confident in his detective work. However, Poirot cleverly pointed out a flaw in Giraud's reasoning, leaving him speechless. As Poirot left, he mentioned the overlooked lead piping, adding another layer to the mystery. Mrs. Renauld's entrance only deepened the intrigue, as Jack stood in silence, his fate hanging in the balance.",1
"The French authorities, our own police force, and the army are all working tirelessly to solve this mystery. Despite their efforts, nothing has been uncovered yet."" As they spoke, there was a knock on the door. A young soldier entered, carrying a sealed envelope which he passed to Lord Estair. ""Fresh from France, sir. I rushed it over as per your instructions."" Lord Estair eagerly tore open the envelope and let out a gasp. The soldier exited the room. ""Finally, a breakthrough! This telegram has just been deciphered. They have located the second vehicle, along with the secretary, Daniels, who was drugged, silenced, and restrained at an old farm near C.""",1
"""Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago.",1
"""He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment maman called me from the house, and I had to go. That is all, only I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.’ Now, Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not see Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?” “Surely, Poirot,” I cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like that would murder his own father.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe anything.” “And the motive?” “Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come in to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.” “But the tramp. Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.” “And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.” “Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs.",1
"""They decided to adopt a common name,"" he explained. ""Elsa Hardt and her companion from New York rented a flat under the alias Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. When they realized they were being pursued by a dangerous secret society, they devised a cunning plan. Knowing that their enemies were unfamiliar with their appearance, they advertised the flat at an unusually low price. With countless Robinsons searching for accommodation in London, they were confident their pursuers would be led astray.""",1
"""I've taken care of everything. Is Mrs. Blair bringing a maid?"" ""Mrs. Blair?"" I exclaimed. ""She said you offered her a spot."" I must have, that one night. I even encouraged her to join. Never expected her to actually come though! Lovely as she is, I'm not sure I want to spend the entire trip to Rhodesia and back with Mrs. Blair. Women need so much attention. And they can be quite a bother at times. ""Did I invite anyone else?"" I asked anxiously. These things happen in moments of excitement. ""Mrs. Blair thought you had also invited Colonel Race."" I sighed.",1
"""But just one or two minor details I'd appreciate your input on nonetheless. Captain Hastings, who is familiar with me, will head up to the residence to notify them of your arrival. By the way, Captain Hastings, where is the little man?” “He's currently bedridden with the flu.” “Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Quite a predicament, you being here without him, isn't it?” With that rather poorly timed joke, I proceeded to the house. I pressed the doorbell, after Japp shut the door. After a brief wait, a middle-aged woman in black answered the door. ""Mr.",1
"“Did you find anything in Renauld’s belongings?” inquired Poirot. “We conducted a thorough search of his study, sifting through his personal papers. Unfortunately, we came up empty-handed. Everything appeared to be in order and nothing caught our attention, except for his will. Take a look.” Poirot quickly perused the document. “I see. A generous bequest of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor – do you know who he is?” “He was Mr. Renauld’s secretary. Although he primarily resided in England, he did visit here occasionally for short periods.” “And the rest of his estate was bequeathed to his dear wife, Eloise. The will is simple, yet legally binding.”",1
"""The issue you wish to discuss with him is grave?” “Absolutely! Last night, my uncle, who is my closest friend, was brutally murdered.” “Here in the city?” “No, in Yorkshire. I was in town when my wife sent me a telegram this morning. As soon as I received it, I decided to come and ask Monsieur Poirot to handle the investigation.” “Excuse me for a moment,” I interjected, struck by a sudden thought. I hurried upstairs and quickly briefed Poirot on the matter. He anticipated my next words. “I understand. You want to lead the investigation yourself, correct? Well, why not? You are familiar with my techniques by now.",1

"Poirot and I arrived in Saint-Omer, where Jack Renauld was being held. The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, welcomed us and expressed his frustration with the clever but rude detective Giraud. Poirot remained cautious, not revealing his suspicions about the case. The magistrate mentioned that Jack had been uncooperative and silent during questioning. Madame Renauld, still unconscious, was in a delicate state. As we discussed the case, M. Hautet remembered a letter for Poirot that had arrived earlier. It was from an unknown woman, written in a flowing foreign hand. Poirot pocketed the letter, thanked the magistrate, and we left the room.",1
"As a crime novelist, I have always been intrigued by the complexity of human nature. One day, a mysterious woman approached me with a proposition that could change everything. She spoke in a language that was foreign to me, yet I couldn't help but be drawn in by her enigmatic presence. Despite her worldly-wise exterior, there was a hint of innocence in her eyes that I couldn't ignore. It was as if she was playing a dangerous game, one that I couldn't resist being a part of.",1
"""But M. Giraud could not be deceived,"" whispered Poirot. ""You may try to deceive me, but I have one final undeniable piece of evidence. Madame Renauld's entire story was a lie, crafted from the very beginning. Despite her supposed love for her husband, she lied to protect his killer. A woman will lie for herself, for the man she loves, or for her children. This is the undeniable truth. You cannot deny it."" Giraud stopped, looking pleased with himself. Poirot met his gaze calmly. ""That is your argument,"" Giraud stated. ""What do you have to say in response?"" ""Only that there is one crucial detail you have overlooked.",1
"As it turns out, the choice is clear. Cinderella is the perfect fit. Cinderella, as you recall, married the Prince. Now, I may not be royalty, but "" She cut me off. ""Cinderella gave him a fair warning, I'm certain! Remember, she couldn't guarantee a transformation into a princess. At the end of the day, she was just a lowly scullery maid."" ""Now it's the Prince's chance to speak up,"" I interjected. ""And do you know what he did?"" ""No?"" ""‘Hell!’ exclaimed the Prince before kissing her!"" I mimicked the gesture. I found myself by the window in Poirot’s quarters, casually observing the street below. ""How odd,"" I muttered quietly. ""What's odd, my friend?"" inquired Poirot calmly, settled comfortably in his chair.",1
"The prisoner, Jack Renauld, remained stoic as he faced the magistrate's questions. Witnesses from the train station positively identified him as being at the scene of the crime. When presented with the aeroplane dagger, Jack calmly admitted it was his own design and a gift to his mother. Despite his lawyer's protests, Jack seemed determined to take control of his own defense, even at the risk of his own fate. It was clear that he was willing to sacrifice himself to protect someone he once loved. The task of securing his acquittal would be a daunting challenge, one that would require facing the harsh truth head-on.",1
"The suspect in the theft of the papers, Luigi Valdarno, was found dead in New York with no papers on him. He had been associated with a mysterious woman, Miss Elsa Hardt, who vanished around the same time. The American Secret Service suspected her to be an international spy.

""But he wasn't a doctor.""""What?""""He wasn't a doctor,"" I reiterated. ""How can you be sure of that, Miss Beddingfeld?""""It's hard to explain, really.

As we arrived at the station, I thought he would depart. Extending my hand, I was surprised when he declined. ""I'll accompany you to see you off. It's only eight o'clock, your train departs in fifteen minutes."" Efficiently, he directed the porters. I stood frozen, avoiding eye contact with Suzanne. The man was suspicious. He was intent on ensuring that I caught the train.",1

And he deserved it. Italian blood runs hot in me. Bound to get in trouble one day.” “Please,” I pleaded, “don’t get angry at me.” “Won’t happen. Liked you from the moment I saw you.

Do you truly believe that I intend to travel to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld seems to imply it in his correspondence.""",1
"""His defeat was quite resounding.” “Poor Giraud,” Poirot remarked, attempting to appear humble. “It’s not solely due to his incompetence. He’s had some bad luck on a few occasions. Like the dark hair wrapped around the dagger, for example. It was rather deceptive, to say the least.” “Honestly, Poirot,” I began slowly, “I’m still not entirely sure whose hair it was?” “Madame Renauld’s, obviously. That’s where the bad luck played into it. Her hair, which was dark before, is now mostly silver.”",1
"""The elderly man never once acknowledged the presence of a woman. He only had eyes for his beloved wife. They were the most devoted couple I know."" Mr. Hautet shook his head softly. ""Mr. Stonor, we have concrete evidence in the form of a love letter from this Bella to Mr. Renauld, accusing him of growing tired of her. Furthermore, we have additional evidence that, at the time of his death, he was engaged in a relationship with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who resides in the neighboring Villa. And this is the man who, as you claim, paid no attention to women!"" The secretary's gaze narrowed. ""Hold on, Mr. Judge. You're looking in the wrong direction. I was acquainted with Paul Renauld. What you have just stated is entirely implausible. There must be another explanation."" The magistrate shrugged. ""What other explanation could there be?"" ""What makes you think it was a romantic affair?"" ""Madame Daubreuil used to visit him in the evenings. Also, ever since Mr. Renauld moved to Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has deposited large sums of money in the bank in cash. Altogether, the total amount comes to four thousand pounds in English currency."" ""I suppose that's correct,"" Stonor murmured. ""I transferred those sums to him at his request. But it was not a romantic involvement."" ""Oh my God! What else could it be?"" ""Blackmail,"" Stonor snapped, slamming his hand on the table. ""That's what it was."" ""Ah! What an idea!"" exclaimed the magistrate, visibly shaken. ""Blackmail,"" Stonor repeated. ""The old man was being extorted, and at a significant pace too. Four thousand in just a couple of months. Whew! I mentioned earlier that there was a mystery surrounding Renauld. Obviously, Madame Daubreuil knew enough to apply pressure."" ""It is possible,"" the commissary said excitedly. ""Decidedly, it is possible."" ""Possible?"" Stonor bellowed. ""It's certain! Have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this alleged romantic affair?"" ""No, sir. We did not want to upset her unnecessarily."" ""Upset her? She would scoff at you. I assure you, she and Renauld were a perfect match."" ""Ah, that reminds me of something else,"" Mr. Hautet interjected. ""Did Mr. Renauld disclose any details about his will to you?"" ""I know all about it. I took it to the lawyer after he had drafted it. I can provide you with the name of his solicitors if you wish to see it. They have a copy. Quite straightforward. Half in trust to his wife, the other half to his son. A few bequests. I believe he left me a thousand."" ""When was this will created?"" ""Oh, about a year and a half ago."" ""Would you be surprised to learn that Mr. Renauld made a new will less than two weeks ago?"" Stonor was visibly taken aback. ""I had no idea. What does it entail?"" ""His entire fortune is left solely to his wife. There is no mention of his son."" Mr. Stonor let out a long whistle. ""That's rather harsh on the boy. His mother loves him, of course, but to others, it may seem like a lack of faith on his father's part. It will be quite humbling for him. Nevertheless, it reinforces my belief that Renauld and his wife had a strong relationship."" ""Indeed, indeed,"" Mr. Hautet agreed. ""We may need to reassess our assumptions on several matters. We have sent a cable to Santiago and are awaiting a response. It is possible that everything will then become clear. On the other hand, if your theory of blackmail is accurate, Madame Daubreuil should be able to provide valuable insights."" Poirot intervened: ""Mr. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, how long had he been in Mr. Renauld's service?"" ""Over a year."" ""Do you know if he has ever been to South America?"" ""I am certain he has not. Before working for Mr. Renauld, he was employed for many years by a family in Gloucestershire whom I am acquainted with."" ""Can you vouch for him as being beyond suspicion?"" ""Absolutely."" Poirot seemed disappointed. Meanwhile, the magistrate called for Marchaud. ""Please inform Mrs. Renauld that I would like to speak with her for a few minutes. Ask her not to trouble herself. I will go to her upstairs."" Marchaud saluted and left. After a few moments, to our surprise, Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in mourning attire, entered the room. Mr. Hautet offered her a chair with profuse apologies, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor held one of her hands with evident sympathy. Words seemed to escape him. Mrs. Renauld turned to Mr. Hautet. ""You wanted to ask me something, Mr. Judge."" ""If you don't mind, madame. I understand your husband was originally from French Canada. Can you provide any insight into his youth or upbringing?"" She shook her head. ""My husband was always secretive about his past, sir. I know he came from the North West, but I suspect he had a difficult childhood since he never spoke of that time. Our focus was always on the present and the future."" ""Was there any mystery in his past?"" Mrs. Renauld smiled faintly and shook her head. ""I don't believe anything so dramatic, Mr. Judge."" Mr. Hautet also smiled. ""Indeed, we must not indulge in melodrama. There is one more thing,"" he hesitated. Stonor interrupted eagerly: ""They have a preposterous notion, Mrs. Renauld. They actually believe that Mr. Renauld was involved with a Madame Daubreuil, who apparently lives next door."" A deep blush spread across Mrs. Renauld's cheeks. She lifted her head high, then bit her lip, her expression trembling. Stonor watched her in astonishment, while Mr. Bex leaned forward and asked gently: ""We regret any distress this may cause you, madame, but do you have reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband's lover?"" With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her body shook with sobs. Finally, she raised her head and said in a broken voice: ""She may have been."" I had never seen Stonor look so utterly dumbfounded in all my years.",1
"Poirot was perplexed as he tried to unravel the mystery surrounding M. Renauld's murder. The commissary and magistrate were discussing the conflicting testimonies of Françoise and Denise, while Poirot examined a worn letter found in the pocket of the dead man's overcoat. The letter, written in English, contained threats from a woman named Bella, indicating a love triangle that may have led to the crime. Poirot noted that the stab in the back was likely done by a man, adding a new layer of complexity to the case. The magistrate suggested reaching out to authorities in Santiago to uncover more about M. Renauld's past. As they delved deeper into the investigation, Poirot remained focused on finding the true motive behind the murder.",1

The pair of bodyguards by Harry’s side lunged forward, only to be halted by his commanding voice. “One more move and it’s over! Anne, pull the trigger if they dare to advance.” “I won’t hesitate,” I responded with a grin. “Actually, I’m quite nervous about using it.” I could tell that Sir Eustace shared my apprehension, as he trembled like a leaf. “Remain in your places,” he instructed, and the guards froze in their tracks. “Order them out of the room,” Harry demanded. Sir Eustace complied without hesitation.",1
"Poirot reappeared at Dover looking brisk and smiling, making our journey to London uneventful. It was well past nine o’clock by the time we arrived, and I assumed we would head straight to our rooms and wait until morning. However, Poirot had different ideas. “We must act quickly, mon ami. The news of the arrest won’t hit the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still time is of the essence.” I didn’t fully grasp his logic, but I inquired about his plan to locate the missing girl. “Do you recall Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? Well, I once helped him with a Japanese wrestler.”",1
"""Then it's settled on the maid,” declared the inspector, satisfied, before resuming his search. Moving on to the maid’s bedroom next door, Poirot furrowed his brow in thought. Abruptly, he turned to Mr. Opalsen with a pointed question. “Was this necklace insured, no question about it?” Mr. Opalsen appeared slightly taken aback by the inquiry. “Yes,” he replied with hesitation, “that is correct.” “But why does it matter?” Mrs. Opalsen interjected tearfully. “I want my necklace back. It was one of a kind. No amount of money could replace it.” “I understand, madame,” Poirot reassured her. “I understand completely.”",1
"""I see myself as a specialized consultant."" Japp chuckled. ""I bet you five pounds that you can't point me in the direction of Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, within a week."" Poirot pondered. ""Very well, my friend, I agree. The thrill of the chase is a passion for you English. Now, the details."" ""Last Saturday, Mr. Davenheim boarded the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, his estate, The Cedars, being located there. He had lunch, inspected the grounds, and spoke with the gardeners as usual. Everyone noted that he was acting completely normal.""",1
"In a flash Poirot sprang up. “Hastings, quick! Let’s follow him.” We discreetly trailed our target through the winding streets of Merlinville. However, Poirot halted as soon as he noticed the man heading towards the station. “Everything is going according to plan. He fell for the trap. He will head to Abbalac, seeking the non-existent valise left by the supposed foreigners. Ah, my friend, it was all a fabrication of mine.” “So you wanted him out of the picture!” I gasped. “Your insight is truly remarkable, Hastings! Now, shall we proceed to the Villa Geneviève?”",1
"Cinderella was standing in the doorway, her breath coming in little gasps. She asked me why I was in Coventry and if the man with me was a detective. As she spoke, her stage dress cloak slipped from her shoulders, revealing her fear. I reassured her, holding her close as she wept bitterly. It was she who took the dagger, afraid of leaving fingerprints. I promised not to give her up to the police, confessing my love for her. She was shocked, asking what I knew. I recounted her visit to Mr. Renauld and the torn cheque.",1
"I have never witnessed a man in such distress. The situation is truly bizarre. Where could the young woman have disappeared to? She left the hotel at eleven-ten, fully clothed, and vanished without a trace. Suicide is out of the question; she was a vibrant soul with a deep love for life. With no trains departing until noon the next day, she couldn't have left town. So, where on earth is she? Race, her partner, is frantic. He has done everything in his power to find her. Law enforcement officers from all over the region have been called in to assist.",1
"We were there the next morning for Jack Renauld's examination. He looked drastically different, with sunken cheeks and dark circles under his eyes. He refused to acknowledge being in Merlinville on the night of the crime, insisting he was in Cherbourg instead. The witnesses identified him from the train, and he recognized the dagger found at the crime scene as his own design. Despite the mounting evidence against him, Jack maintained his innocence, stating he did not kill his father. Suddenly, a lady entered the room and confessed to the murder, revealing the truth behind the tangled web of lies and deceit.",1
"""But the real question is whether he actually revealed his secret to her. The examining magistrate is optimistic, but I have my doubts.” As we strolled along the path leading to the intersection where our car had broken down earlier, it suddenly struck me that the Villa Marguerite, the residence of the enigmatic Madame Daubreuil, was the same quaint cottage where the lovely young woman had appeared. “She has resided here for quite some time,” remarked the commissary, gesturing towards the dwelling. “Very discreetly, without drawing any attention. It appears she has no family or close companions aside from the people she knows in Merlinville.""",1
"The valet was surprised by the card's quality in Mr. Opalsen's possession. Poirot expressed his gratitude before the valet left, casting a curious look at the mess in the room. Poirot mused aloud about the heavily insured necklace as he tidied up the papers. ""And the necklace was heavily insured..."" I exclaimed, but Poirot shut me down. ""You see nothing, my friend,"" he retorted. ""As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us go back to our rooms.""",1
"Poirot was engrossed in reading his letters when suddenly his attention shifted. A letter from a mysterious Mr. Renauld in France, urgently requesting his detective services, caught his eye. Poirot's interest was piqued, and he wasted no time in deciding to embark on this new adventure. The urgency of the situation was clear, and they needed to act swiftly. The mention of Santiago and South America added a layer of intrigue to the case. The clock was ticking, and there was no time to waste. A sense of excitement filled the air as Poirot and his companion prepared to embark on their journey to France.",1
"I caught my breath at the sight before me, a hunger for the unknown swelling inside. The Kilmorden drew closer, like a dream. Another figure appeared, familiar yet distant after the events of the previous night. His warning of danger lingered, leaving me unsettled. As we parted ways, his footsteps echoing, I knew our paths would not cross again. The next hours were a blur of bureaucracy and relief, until I found myself at the Mount Nelson, surrounded by sunshine and flowers. Suzanne's indifference contrasted with my excitement, but I reveled in the beauty around me. This is not a story of South Africa, with no promise of local color. My inability to provide italics of authenticity is clear, but the essence of the tale remains.",1
"""His demeanor remained composed as he penned the letter, yet in a sudden burst of emotion, he hastily wrote those four frantic words."" Disagreeing, my companion vigorously shook his head. ""You are mistaken. Can you not see that while the signature ink is dark, the postscript ink is faint?"" Perplexed, I replied, ""And?"" ""Ah, my friend, engage your intellect! Is it not clear? M. Renauld composed his letter, read it over without smudging, then, with intent, included those final words before blotting the page.""",1
"""Shall we start?"" asked Poirot. ""Yes,"" Black replied nervously. Poirot took out his watch and placed it on the table. ""Let's begin. Day."" ""Night,"" Black responded. Poirot continued, ""Name."" ""Place."" ""Bernard."" ""Shaw."" ""Tuesday."" ""Dinner."" ""Journey."" ""Ship."" ""Country."" ""Uganda."" ""Story."" ""Lions."" ""Rook Rifle."" ""Farm."" ""Shot."" ""Suicide."" ""Elephant."" ""Tusks."" ""Money."" ""Lawyers."" Poirot explained his analysis to Hastings. He then spoke to Black, who confirmed a story about a suicide with a rook rifle on a farm. Poirot later broke the news to the widow, who was in denial. After dinner, a scream was heard, causing fear in the household. The door inexplicably opened, adding to the eerie atmosphere.",1
"” She reluctantly agreed, promising to revisit the topic once we reached the Falls. The train departed at nine in the morning. Sir Eustace remained in a foul mood, while Miss Pettigrew appeared meek. Colonel Race exuded his usual air of confidence. I couldn't shake the feeling that our previous discussion was a figment of my imagination. That night, I slept fitfully on my uncomfortable cot, tormented by vague, threatening nightmares. The next morning, I awoke with a pounding headache and stepped out onto the observation deck. The air was crisp and fragrant, and as far as the eye could see, rolling wooded hills stretched out in every direction.”",1
"“How can I deal with a secretary like that? His face is an unpleasant shade of yellow, not a good match for a black eye. I'm done with secretaries unless I find a nice girl, someone with gentle eyes who will comfort me when I'm upset. What do you say, Miss Anne? Are you up for the job?"" ""How often will I need to comfort you?"" I inquired, chuckling. ""All day long,"" Sir Eustace flirtatiously replied. ""I won't get much work done if that's the case,"" I teased. ""That's alright. This workload is all Pagett's doing. He's working me to the bone.""",1
"Poirot calmly read through his correspondence. There was a request to give a lecture to boy scouts, a Countess wanting his visit, and then, a mysterious letter caught his attention. It was from a man in France, seeking a detective discreetly. Poirot accepted the case without hesitation, sensing urgency. The man, Mr. Renauld, needed help and was willing to pay any price. Poirot and his companion quickly prepared to leave for France, intrigued by the unusual nature of the case. They were off to solve the mystery in Merlinville, a place that held secrets waiting to be uncovered.",1
"I woke up from a nightmare, a horrifying one where she was in grave danger. Alarmed, I rushed to her room to check on her safety. To my dismay, she was nowhere to be found, and her bed appeared untouched. She gazed at me with concern. ""What do you suggest, Sir Eustace?"" Tempted to respond with a dismissive remark, I instead furrowed my brow thoughtfully. ""Just go to bed, and try not to fret unnecessarily. A capable young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is more than capable of looking after herself."" I inquired, ""What is Race's opinion on this matter?"" It was time to challenge Race's authority and allow him to experience both the benefits and drawbacks of female company. ""I've searched everywhere for him.",1
"""We caught up with Cinderella and headed swiftly towards Villa Geneviève. Poirot cast a glance back at the lighted window, observing Marthe's profile as she worked diligently. 'He's under watch, no doubt,' he whispered. Upon reaching Villa Geneviève, Poirot positioned himself discreetly behind some foliage to the left of the driveway, granting us a clear view while remaining unseen. The Villa was shrouded in darkness, its occupants likely asleep. We found ourselves right beneath Mrs. Renauld's open bedroom window in no time.""",1
"Harry took a moment to collect his thoughts before continuing. ""I was deeply in love with her, so much so that it scared her at times. But his love for her was different - quieter, yet more profound. She was his everything, and her betrayal shattered his world. The pain was so intense, it left him unable to move."" Harry fell silent for a moment, then resumed speaking. ""You see, I was declared 'Missing, presumed dead.' I never bothered to correct the mistake. I adopted the alias Parker and sought refuge on this familiar island. Initially, I had hoped to clear my name during the war, but now that determination had faded.""",1
"""I overheard the conversation."" ""What did you hear?"" ""It was rather heated. Shortly after, there was a commotion. Running into the hallway, I nearly bumped into Mrs. Middleton. That's when the gunshot rang out. The entrance to the gun-room was barricaded from the inside, so we hurried around the house to the window. By the time we made it inside, the killer had already fled. Unfortunately, my uncle,"" she hesitated, ""was found with a fatal gunshot wound to the head. I immediately instructed Mrs. Middleton to contact the authorities. I made sure not to disturb anything in the room, leaving it undisturbed as I discovered it.""",1
"""I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I declared with authority. “Take me to his private car immediately.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were surprised to see me on the observation platform. “Well, well, Miss Anne,” exclaimed Colonel Race. “Back from Durban, are you? What a pleasant surprise.” Suzanne remained silent, her eyes full of unspoken questions. “I must find my chief,” I stated calmly. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office compartment,” Colonel Race replied. “Dictating at a remarkable pace to Miss Pettigrew.” “Such dedication to work,” I remarked. “Indeed,” agreed Colonel Race.",1
"I have informed Mr. Blair that he needs to handle some rare and valuable curios in Cape Town. Miss Pettigrew and I are leaving for an adventure together. The situation in Johannesburg is tense, with strikers causing chaos in the streets. I met Reeves, who is now retracting his inflammatory speeches. The Government suspects a secret organization behind the unrest. A Government official hinted at trouble and offered to send me to Pretoria. Anne is safe in Kimberley, much to my relief. Race and I discussed Anne's mysterious disappearance. Suzanne expressed concerns about her marriage. The conversation then turned to the diamonds.",1
"""Is this for my father?"" He asked, his voice filled with emotion and indignation. ""Yes, we discovered it in his coat pocket."" ""Do you know who sent it?"" He paused, glancing briefly at his mother. The magistrate caught on. ""Not yet. Any thoughts on the sender?"" ""I'm clueless,"" M. Hautet admitted. ""A truly baffling case. Well, I guess we can eliminate the letter as a lead now. Your thoughts, M. Giraud?"" ""It's a dead end,"" the detective confirmed.",1

The author reflects on Poirot's role in averting a national crisis. Poirot and the author discuss the attempted assassination of the Prime Minister. Poirot deals with a charlady's case before receiving important visitors - Lord Estair and Mr. Bernard Dodge.",1
"He walked past us without acknowledging our presence, but I couldn't help noticing his striking appearance - a lean, sun-kissed face that hinted at a life spent in tropical lands. Poirot approached the gardener, who had momentarily paused from his leaf-clearing duties. ""Do you know that gentleman?"" Poirot inquired urgently. ""He was here last week, Tuesday night."" We hurried after the mysterious man, witnessing a tense encounter with Mrs. Maltravers. As Poirot delved deeper into the investigation, a shocking revelation emerged, leading to a dramatic turn of events.",1
"""Excuse me, but could you please unlock Mr. Opalsen's room for me?"" Poirot asked the chambermaid. She led the way to the room, unlocking it with her pass-key. Poirot showed her a card, asking if she had seen it before, but she hadn't. Poirot then asked the valet the same question, with no luck. As Poirot prepared to leave for London, he asked Hastings to brush off some French chalk powder from his coat sleeve. The next day, Poirot revealed that the chambermaid and valet were the culprits behind the theft of the necklace, using a clever plan involving the French chalk.",1
"“When we first arrived in Merlinville, do you recall the striking girl at the gate? You mentioned a young goddess, but all I saw was a girl with troubled eyes. That’s how I’ve always seen Marthe Daubreuil. The girl with troubled eyes. Why was she so troubled? It wasn’t about Jack Renauld, as she didn’t know he had been in Merlinville the night before.” “Speaking of Jack Renauld, how is he doing?” “He’s improving. Still staying at Villa Marguerite.”",1
"""Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me. I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s me Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it. “Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got lots of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar.”",1
"""Hautet, removing his hat, “we deeply apologize for the intrusion, but you understand the requirements of the Law? Please convey my regards to Madame your mother, and would she kindly spare me a brief moment for a conversation.” The girl hesitated briefly, her left hand clutching her side to calm the overwhelming turmoil in her heart. Eventually, she regained composure and whispered, “I'll check. Please, follow me.” Leading him into a room on the left side of the hallway, we could hear the faint murmur of their conversation.""",1
"""In fact, a friend from the City tipped me off about a lucrative opportunity. With money to spare, I suggested a weekend getaway at the Grand Metropolitan would be just the ticket for us all."" ""Thank you, I graciously accept. Your kindness towards an old man is truly heartwarming. In the grand scheme of things, it's the kindness that truly matters. Sometimes, I forget that,"" I hesitated at the insinuation. Poirot seems to underestimate my intellect at times.""",1
"I turned away in disgust at the girl's ghoulish excitement. It made me wonder about the modern woman's obsession with morbid sensation. Despite her beauty, I couldn't shake my disapproval. The lady challenged me, saying women are no longer the delicate creatures of the past. She convinced me to show her around, hinting at the possibility of a big scoop for the papers. I hesitated, but her soft hand in mine was my undoing. We went first to where the body was found, then cautiously approached the Villa. I led her to the back where the shed was located, hoping to avoid any unwanted encounters. I left her hidden in the shrubbery as I entered the house, the voices inside growing louder.",1

"At the stroke of one o’clock, I was certain that something would occur. Throughout the night, I could hear my fellow passengers retiring to their cabins. Bits of conversation and laughter drifted in through the transom before all fell silent. The majority of the lights extinguished, leaving only a faint glow from the lone light in the corridor. As the sound of eight bells resonated through the ship, the ensuing hour felt interminable. I discreetly checked my watch, anxious not to miss the anticipated event.",1
"“Where is your assistant now?” “He’s out sick with a stomach issue,” I replied. “Are you certain it’s just a stomach issue?” “Absolutely. He gets them often.” My guest smirked. “It might be more than a stomach issue. Only time will tell. But let me assure you, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray wouldn’t be shocked if there was an attempt to remove your assistant. Don’t worry about yourself” I must have shown a hint of concern “you’re not in danger. With your assistant gone, it would be easier to reach you. Either way, Mr. Milray wants me to go with you.",1
"""Parties sometimes join me on my boat from the hotel, but my expenses are minimal and I live as I wish."" ""Do you live here alone?"" ""I have no desire for company,"" he replied coldly. ""I apologize for imposing mine on you,"" I responded, ""but I had no say in the matter."" Surprisingly, his eyes sparkled slightly. ""None at all. I lifted you over my shoulders like a sack of coal and brought you to my boat. Reminiscent of a primitive man from the Stone Age."" ""For a different reason,"" I added. This time, he blushed deeply, his face turning a shade of tan.",1
"After conversing with Colonel Race, Suzanne announced her fatigue and retired to bed. Unwilling to stay alone with him, I also stood and made my way to my own room. Despite my restlessness, I found myself unable to sleep. Instead of changing into nightclothes, I reclined in a chair, lost in reverie. An ominous sense of impending danger loomed nearer with each passing moment. Suddenly, a sharp rap at the door startled me from my thoughts. Approaching cautiously, I opened the door to find a young boy holding out a mysterious note addressed to me in an unfamiliar handwriting. Accepting the note, I returned to the room, puzzled by its contents.",1
"“Furthermore, how do you explain the excavation of the burial site? That required considerable effort.” “Perhaps she had assistance,” I proposed, reluctant to abandon my theory. “I move on to another issue. You mentioned the resemblance between the two incidents. What exactly is it, my dear companion?” I gazed at him in surprise. “Poirot, it was actually you who pointed that out! The account of the masked intruders, the ‘mystery,’ the documents!” Poirot smirked slightly. “Please, do not be so outraged. I stand by my observations. The likeness of the narratives inevitably ties the two scenarios together. However, consider now something quite peculiar.",1
"He kept questioning her. ""Were you aware of your husband having a visitor last night?"" Her cheeks turned slightly red, but she calmly asked, ""Who was it?"" ""A lady."" ""Really?"" The magistrate decided to stop there for now. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil was involved in the crime, and he didn't want to upset Mrs. Renauld unnecessarily. He signaled to the commissary, who nodded in response. Rising, the commissary retrieved the glass jar from the outhouse, holding the dagger. ""Madame,"" he said gently, ""do you recognize this?"" She gasped. ""Yes, that's my dagger."" But when she saw the stained tip, horror filled her eyes. ""Is that blood?"" ""Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this."" After quickly hiding it, he asked, ""Are you sure it's the one from your dressing table?"" ""Yes, it was a gift from my son, who served in the Air Force. He lied about his age to join."" Pride filled her voice. ""This was made from an aeroplane wire, a souvenir from the War."" ""I understand, madame. This leads to another matter. Where is your son now? We need to contact him urgently."" ""Jack? He's on his way to Buenos Ayres."" ""What?"" ""Yes. My husband wired him yesterday, redirecting him from Paris to South America. A boat left Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he was told to catch it."" ""Do you know what business he had in Buenos Ayres?"" ""No, monsieur, I'm unaware. Santiago was his final destination after Buenos Ayres."" The magistrate and commissary reacted simultaneously: ""Santiago! Again, Santiago!"" At that moment, Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld, asking to see her wrists. Surprised, she extended them, revealing cruel red marks where cords had bitten into her skin. As Poirot inspected them, a flicker of excitement disappeared from his eyes. ""They must hurt,"" he remarked, looking puzzled. The magistrate urgently insisted on contacting young M. Renauld via wireless to gather information about the trip to Santiago. Mrs. Renauld, though in pain, was ready to proceed with the identification of her husband's body. She was escorted down the stairs, and upon seeing the dead man, she cried out and fainted. The doctor and M. Hautet carried her inside. Poirot, realizing his mistake, resolved to start anew. The commissary expressed sympathy for the woman's condition and suggested visiting the crime scene. Poirot, dissatisfied with the lack of noise from the staircase, pondered on the unlikely scenario of the front door being open. The commissary explained the barred windows, but Poirot pointed to a tree by a first-floor window, indicating an easier access point.",1
"It truly seemed as if Jack was careening towards his inevitable fate, with no regard for the consequences. I understood the urgent need he felt to hide the existence of a second dagger in the case, all for the sake of protecting Bella. As long as it was believed that there was only one weapon involved, suspicion would not fall upon the girl who had possessed the second paper-knife. Jack was bravely shielding his former lover, but it was becoming increasingly clear to me the great sacrifice he was making. The enormity of the challenge I had assigned to Poirot was beginning to dawn on me. It would be no simple feat to prove Jack Renauld's innocence without revealing the whole truth.",1

Despite the thorough search, nothing incriminating was found on her person. With a solemn expression, the inspector informed Célestine that she would still need to accompany him. Addressing Mrs. Opalsen, he apologized for the inconvenience, explaining that all evidence seemed to implicate Célestine. If the missing items were not on her, they must be concealed somewhere in the room.",1
"""My friend,"" I exclaimed, ""you must leave tomorrow. I will cover all your costs."" Florence in January was not the typical choice, but Pagett seemed unfazed. I could picture him exploring the galleries, guidebook in hand. A week of solitude was well worth the expense. The past week had been pure bliss. I had indulged in all my desires, free from any unwanted obligations. However, as I awoke to find Pagett blocking the morning light at the ungodly hour of 9 a.m., I knew our time had come to an end.",1
"“Well, there's always Sir Eustace Pedler’s property,” the man hesitated. “The Mill House, you're familiar with it.” “Not exactly where,” I stumbled. (Honestly, stumbling is becoming my forte.) “That's right! The scene of the crime. But maybe you wouldn't be interested.”“Oh, I don't believe I'd be bothered,” I responded with a show of confidence. I believed my credibility was now firmly established. “And maybe I could snag a deal under the circumstances.” A stroke of genius, in my opinion. “Well, it's a possibility. Letting it out won't be easy now with servants and all that, you understand.”",1
"As I attempted to exit through the hall door, I quickly realized it was not an option. With no other choice, I cautiously made my way up to the attic, tightly securing my restraints before laying back down on the cold floor. I stayed still, anticipating the possibility of being discovered. Thankfully, no one came to investigate. After what seemed like an eternity, I cautiously descended the staircase, only to find the Kafir standing watch by the door, his gentle humming filling the air. Feeling trapped, I retreated back to the attic once more. It was evident that the Kafir was determined to keep a close eye on me throughout the night. I waited in silence as the noises of morning preparations echoed through the house.",1
"Jack barely caught his train in Paris after rushing from the library to retrieve his forgotten bag. Out of breath and angry, his face flushed with color, he narrowly made it in time. A dispute that left him fuming was overheard, but the details were lost in the chaos of yelling voices. Poirot, unruffled by the commotion, chose to wait in the cool salon for the return of the examining magistrate. Meanwhile, I decided to investigate on my own and stumbled upon Cinderella, who was unexpectedly nosing around the crime scene. Her morbid curiosity about the murder at the Villa Geneviève both intrigued and repulsed me. I couldn't help but wonder what the world was coming to, with women like her seeking thrills from such gruesome events.",1
"I heard her voice next, clear and sharp, tinged with a hint of an exotic accent: ‘Marlow, The Mill House. Belongs to Sir Eustace Pedler. I think it might be just right for me. I'll pay a visit.’ The man handed her a note and she sauntered out, exuding an air of royalty. She didn't acknowledge Carton in any way, yet I had a feeling their encounter was planned. My mind raced with assumptions. Unaware that Sir Eustace was in Cannes, I suspected this house hunt was a ruse to rendezvous with him at the Mill House.",1
"Poirot scanned the room, taking note of the key details that I had outlined in a diagram. ""Where does that door lead?"" he asked, gesturing towards the one beside the window. ""Into the next room, I think,"" replied the inspector. ""It's locked from this side."" Poirot approached the door, tested it, then unlocked and retested it. ""And locked on the other side too,"" he observed. ""That avenue is closed."" Moving on, he inspected the windows one by one.",1
"I was trapped by my captor, a man who clearly had been following my every move. Despite my attempts to reason with him, he seemed determined to keep me captive. I found myself bound and gagged in a dusty attic, completely at his mercy. As the night wore on, I struggled against my restraints, desperate for a way out. And then, in the dim moonlight, I spotted a glint of broken glass in the corner. An idea began to form in my mind. Despite the pain and stiffness, I knew I had to try. Slowly, I started to roll towards the glass, inching closer with every agonizing movement. It was a risky plan, but it was my only hope of escape.",1
"""Yes,"" I exclaimed, ""but who is the victim?"" ""I know not. A stranger. They discovered him in the shed just a short distance from poor Monsieur's body. And there's more. He was stabbed, stabbed in the heart with the very same dagger!"" Without hesitation, I sprinted up the path to the shed. The two guards stepped aside to allow me through, and with anticipation coursing through me, I stepped inside. The light was dim, the structure was a simple wooden shelter for storing old pots and tools. Although I had rushed in, I paused at the threshold, captivated by the scene unfolding before me.",1
"""But he chose his words carefully: “Certainly, the ‘Colonel’ is known for being a generous employer. I believe his ability to shift blame onto others has played a significant role in his achievements. A brilliant mind, truly extraordinary! A firm believer in the principle, ‘If you want something done right, don’t do it yourself!’ Here we all are, implicated and completely at his mercy, yet none of us can find any fault with him.” He stopped, as if anticipating a rebuttal from her, but she simply smiled quietly. “None of us,” he reflected.""",1
"""I don't believe that,” Poirot said with a mysterious grin. “I know it's the hair of a woman, and not just any woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I declared confidently. “Maybe,” Poirot replied, giving me a curious look. I kept my composure. “What's our next move?” I inquired, as we stepped into the foyer of the Villa Geneviève. “I plan to investigate M. Jack Renauld's belongings. That's why I needed to keep him occupied for a while.” “Won't Giraud have already done a search?” I questioned skeptically. “Certainly.",1
"He managed to have the case thrown out, but it resulted in two young men being ruined and publicly shamed as thieves. It shattered the old man's heart. After a bitter confrontation with his son, he disowned him completely. The son, in his pride, chose to remain silent, refusing to defend his innocence to his father. Enraged after the encounter, he met up with his friend, and a week later they both enlisted in the war together. Tragically, his friend was killed due to reckless behavior. The man's death was a devastating blow, leaving his reputation tarnished forever.",1
"A large chintz-covered sofa sat against the far wall, while the window seats were also adorned with the same old-fashioned pattern. ""Well, my friend,"" Poirot stated, lighting a small cigarette, ""we need to strategize our next move. I've already examined the house, but I believe the key clue lies within this room. Our task will be to carefully review the documents in the desk. The will may not be there, but a seemingly ordinary paper could hold the secret to its location.""",1
"Colonel Race signaled with his hand. Arthur Minks, also known as the Rev. Edward Chichester and Miss Pettigrew, hesitantly stepped forward. Despite his pallor and nervous demeanor, he recounted, “I encountered Nadina in Paris the evening prior to her departure for England. At that time, I was assuming the identity of a Russian Count. She confided in me about her intentions. Although I cautioned her against it, fully aware of the individual she was dealing with, she disregarded my warning. A wireless message lay on the nearby table, which I proceeded to peruse. Subsequently, I contemplated making an attempt for the diamonds myself. However, in Johannesburg, I was approached by Mr. Rayburn.""",1
"""Comme ça! A magnificent stone without a flaw,"" he exclaimed as he examined the jewel closely. ""You will leave it with me, n’est-ce pas?"" Miss Marvell explained her plan to visit Yardly Chase with the diamond, despite Poirot's suggestion against it. The conversation turned to the famous Star of the East diamond in the Yardly collection, sparking Poirot's interest. Suddenly, Gregory Rolf, a dashing actor, entered the room, discussing the upcoming trip. Poirot advised against taking the diamond, causing tension between Mary and her husband. Despite Mary's protests, Poirot stood firm in his decision.",1
"""He managed to get the case dismissed, but it ruined two young men and left them to face the world as thieves. It devastated the old man, leading to a bitter confrontation with his son. The son, silent and proud, enlisted in the war with his friend, who ended up losing his life due to recklessness. The old man, revealing his bitterness towards a woman, took on a new identity and lived a numb existence on an island. But when he encountered a man who recognized him, he was stirred back to life. The man revealed his involvement in the robbery, his marriage to the woman, and the hidden diamonds. The old man, determined to clear his name, followed the man to England on a boat.""",1
"""I consider it my personal property,"" he stated confidently. However, I viewed the responsibility as the one area where a secretary truly proved their worth. ""Let's book an additional cabin,"" I suggested quickly. The task appeared straightforward, yet Pagett thrived on creating enigmas. The following day, he approached me with the countenance of a Renaissance plotter. ""You instructed me to reserve Cabin 17 as an office, correct?"" ""Yes, what about it? Is the stationery trunk blocking the entrance?"" ""The doorways are identical in all cabins,"" Pagett responded gravely. ""But trust me, Sir Eustace, there's something unsettling about that particular cabin."" Thoughts of The Upper Berth by F. Marion Crawford crossed my mind.",1
"""Indeed, he did not object to me joining Sir Eustace on the boat. He was not ready to be caught just yet. It appeared that Nadina did not bring the jewels to the rendezvous as planned, and Carton might be the one concealing them on the Kilmorden Castle. They were hoping I had a clue to their location. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not retrieve the diamonds, he remained in danger and was desperate to get them back. Where Carton hid them, if he did, remained a mystery to me.""",1
"""But the insides of this feline are exquisitely fragile. I am referring to its interior.” With a sudden grunt, the second man snatched the cat from Poirot’s grasp. “Oh, I neglected to make proper introductions,” Japp remarked. “Mr. Poirot, meet Mr. Burt from the United States Secret Service.” The American’s skilled hands had sensed what he was after. He extended his hand, momentarily at a loss for words. Then he composed himself. “A pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Mr. Burt greeted. “Perhaps,” Poirot murmured, “there is a chance I won’t perish on this occasion.” As a recovering flu patient, I took this statement as a sign of hope and optimism.",1
"I wasn't expecting that the seemingly unimportant note would lead to such a shocking discovery. The body of a woman found in a lonely house, strangled to death, added a whole new layer of mystery to the case. As the details unfolded, it became clear that there was more to this story than initially met the eye. The new development only heightened my curiosity, pushing me to delve deeper into the dark secrets that seemed to be lurking beneath the surface.",1
"""Is it possible? My husband was the most absent-minded man."" Her brow furrowed slightly as she mentioned this particular flaw in her late husband. The commissary interjected, ""I believe there is an important conclusion to be drawn here. The fact that the men required M. Renauld to dress himself suggests that the location they intended to bring him, where 'the secret' was hidden, was quite a distance away."" The magistrate agreed, ""Indeed, not too close, but also not too far, considering he expected to return by morning.""",1
"""Having assumed I was alone on the boat deck, I was surprised to see another figure gazing out at the city. I instantly recognized him before he even turned around. The events of last night felt surreal in the calm morning light. What did he think of me? The words I had spoken made me cringe with embarrassment. Did I truly mean them? I quickly averted my gaze, focusing intently on Table Mountain. If Rayburn sought solitude up here, I would not intrude by making my presence known.""",1
"As we prepared to call it a night, Sir Guy suddenly grasped Poirot's arm and pointed ahead. Among the tents, a mysterious figure was seen moving in the shadows. It bore a resemblance to the dog-headed entity I had previously observed in the tomb engravings. A chill ran down my spine at the eerie sight. ""Mon Dieu!"" Poirot uttered, making the sign of the cross fervently. ""Anubis, the jackal-headed deity of the afterlife."" Dr. Tosswill abruptly stood up, declaring, ""Someone is playing a prank on us."" Sir Guy, visibly shaken, whispered, ""It entered your tent, Harper,"" his complexion drained of color.",1
"The individuals responsible for packing the items have described them as having a unique and challenging shape, requiring custom-made cases. Mrs. Blair has been made aware that transporting these items home will come at a high cost. Meanwhile, Pagett is eager to reunite with me in Jo’burg, but I plan to keep him in Cape Town under the guise of overseeing Mrs. Blair's cases. I have instructed Pagett to ensure the safe handling of the cases, emphasizing the rare and valuable contents. With everything settled, Miss Pettigrew and I embark on our journey together, which, to any observer, appears entirely above board.",1
"In a single cunning move, the blackmailed individual not only eliminated the blackmailer, but also cleverly framed another unsuspecting victim for the crime. The unmistakable mark of the notorious 'Colonel' was evident in the scheme. Once again, I found myself ensnared in his web of deception. How foolish I was to have fallen into the trap so effortlessly. Disoriented, I exited the scene, trying to maintain a facade of composure, knowing that it was only a matter of time before the truth would surface and my identity would be broadcast far and wide.",1
"Then, his expression brightening, he hurried over to the desk. Within moments, he was sifting through the deceased man's checkbook. After a moment, he gestured with excitement. The final stub was left untouched. ""Courage!"" exclaimed Poirot, giving him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. ""Undoubtedly, Madame Renauld will have valuable insight into this enigmatic individual known as Duveen."" The police commissioner's demeanor lightened. ""You're right. Let's move forward."" As we prepared to exit the room, Poirot offhandedly mentioned: ""This is where M. Renauld entertained his visitor last evening, correct?"" ""Yes, but how could you possibly know that?"" ""By this. I discovered it on the rear of the leather armchair.""",1
"""In the first scene, there were clear impressions left by the suspect's heavy boots, but in the second scene, not a single mark! It's clear that someone deliberately tried to cover their tracks by smoothing out the bed with a rake.""""Where would they have found a rake?""""The same place they found the shovel and gardening gloves,"" Poirot replied impatiently. ""That shouldn't be hard to figure out.""""But why do you think they exited that way? Isn't it more likely they came in through the window and left through the door?""""Of course, that's a possibility. But my gut tells me they made their escape through the window.""""I disagree with you.""""Perhaps you're right, my friend. But my instincts tell me otherwise.""",1
"""His memory was blank, only recalling a sudden pressure on his face and a desperate fight for freedom. Law enforcement deemed his account credible."" ""Have they uncovered anything else?"" ""Negative."" ""No sign of the PM's corpse? There might be a chance. Yet, it's odd. After the assassination attempt earlier, why the effort to preserve his life now?"" Dodge shrugged. ""It’s clear they'll stop at nothing to stop him from reaching the Conference.""",1

"With your approval, my friend, I shall step outside for a breath of fresh air. Please anticipate my prompt return. I do not intend to be away for long."" I was in a daze in my armchair when the innkeeper knocked on the door and peeked inside. ""There is another woman here to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I informed her that he was not in, but she insists on waiting, claiming she has journeyed from the countryside."" ""Very well, bring her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can be of assistance."" In a flash, the woman was escorted into the room. My pulse quickened as I realized who she was. Lady Yardly had been featured too many times in the Society pages to go unnoticed.",1
"I chuckled. Everyone mocks that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were wanderers, you see. It wasn’t until they settled in communities, with women doing one thing and men another, that women became weak. And deep down, one remains the same, feels the same, I mean, and that's why women admire physical strength in men, it's what they once possessed and have lost.” “So it's almost like ancestor worship, isn’t it?” “Something along those lines.” “And do you really believe that? That women idolize strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one is honest. You may think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to a primitive state where only the physical matters. But I don’t think that’s the end of it. If you lived in primitive conditions, it would be acceptable, but you don’t, and in the end, the other qualities prevail. It’s the things that seem defeated that always triumph, isn’t it? They triumph in the most important way. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” Colonel Race pondered, “you fall in love and then fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not quite, but you could put it that way if you prefer.” “But have you ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I confessed honestly. “Or fallen in love, for that matter?” I remained silent. The car stopped at our destination, concluding our conversation. We exited the vehicle and began the gradual climb to the World’s View. Once again, I felt a slight unease in Colonel Race’s presence. He concealed his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He intimidated me a little. He always had. I never knew where I stood with him. We ascended in silence until we arrived at the place where Rhodes is surrounded by enormous boulders. A peculiar, eerie place, far from human habitation, that sings a constant song of rugged beauty. We sat there in silence for a while. Then descended once more, deviating slightly from the path. At times it was a challenging climb, and once we encountered a steep slope or rock that was nearly vertical. Colonel Race went ahead, then turned to assist me. “I should carry you,” he said suddenly, lifting me off the ground with a swift movement. I felt his strength as he placed me down and released his grip. A man of iron, with muscles like tightly drawn steel. And once again, I felt fearful, especially as he did not step aside, but stood directly in front of me, gazing into my eyes. “What are you truly doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he asked abruptly. “I’m a wanderer exploring the world.” “Yes, that's accurate. The newspaper correspondent is just a facade. You don’t have the soul of a journalist. You are pursuing life for your own sake. But that's not all.” What was he trying to make me reveal? I was frightened. I met his gaze directly. My eyes may not keep secrets like his, but they can wage war against the enemy. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I inquired deliberately. For a moment, I thought he wouldn’t respond. He was clearly surprised, though. Finally, he spoke, with a hint of grim amusement in his words. “Chasing ambition,” he stated. “Simply pursuing ambition. You will recall, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I spoke slowly, “that you are involved with the Government, that you are part of the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my imagination, or did he pause for a fraction of a second before replying? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am here strictly as a private individual traveling for my own pleasure.” Reflecting on his response later, it seemed somewhat ambiguous to me. Perhaps he intended it to be so. We returned to the car in silence. Halfway back to Bulawayo, we stopped for tea at a somewhat basic structure on the side of the road. The owner was digging in the garden and appeared irritated at being interrupted. However, he kindly agreed to see what he could provide. After an endless wait, he brought us some stale cakes and lukewarm tea. Then he went back to his garden. As soon as he left, we were surrounded by cats. Six of them, all meowing pitifully at once. The noise was deafening. I offered them some cake, which they devoured eagerly. I poured all the milk into a saucer, and they fought each other to lap it up. “Oh,” I exclaimed indignantly, “they're starving! It’s cruel. Please, order more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race silently went to fulfill my request. The cats began meowing again. He returned with a large jug of milk, which the cats finished quickly. I stood up determinedly. “I’m taking these cats home with us. I won’t leave them here.” “My dear, don’t be ridiculous. You can't carry six cats along with fifty wooden animals.” “Forget the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I'll take them with me.” “You will do no such thing.” I glared at him, but he continued, “You may think me harsh, but one can't go through life being sentimental about these matters. There’s no use in arguing—I won’t let you take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always recognize when I’m defeated. I went back to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just for today,” he reassured me. “That man's wife has gone to Bulawayo for supplies. So everything will be fine. Besides, you know, the world is full of hungry cats.” “Please, stop,” I said firmly. “I’m teaching you to understand life as it is. I’m teaching you to be tough and ruthless like me. That’s the key to strength and success.”",1
"His accomplices may have used a different method to incapacitate him, for example, they could have threatened him with a weapon instead. The Police Inspector and Major Norman discuss the possibility that the Prime Minister might have been kidnapped rather than escaped. They decide to return to England to investigate further. Poirot explains that the Prime Minister was kidnapped on his way to London, and a clever scheme involving a fake double was used to deceive the public.",1
"The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.” “But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every one!” “He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.” “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?” “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.” “And the real Prime Minister?” “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs. Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity. “When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” “When I began to work the right way from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a mind like mine!” The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran: “In time.” Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression. Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly. “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us. “To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.” I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp. “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.” Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply: “Be exact, my friend. What do you mean by ‘disappear’? To which class of disappearance are you referring?” “Are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” I laughed. Japp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both. “But certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First, and most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much abused ‘loss of memory’ case rare, but occasionally genuine. Third, murder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you refer to all three as impossible of execution?” “Very nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory, but some one would be sure to recognize you especially in the case of a well-known man like Davenheim. Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up against civilization.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you make one error. You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man or with himself in a figurative sense might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.” “But not you, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at me. “He couldn’t baffle you, eh, Monsieur Poirot?” Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest. “Me, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with an exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only too rare in the new generation of detectives!” Japp grinned more widely. “I don’t know,” he said. “Miller, the man who’s on this case, is a smart chap.",1
"I hoped it was nothing crucial that he had misplaced, and for the first time I examined it. It was a simple half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scribbled upon it in pencil. This is a copy of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: "". 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] At first glance, it did not seem to be of any significance. Nevertheless, I hesitated to discard it. While holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure. Moth balls again! I cautiously held the paper to my nose. Yes, it smelled strongly of them. However, I folded up the paper meticulously and placed it in my bag. I strolled home leisurely and engaged in a lot of contemplation. I informed Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a distressing incident in the Tube and that I was rather disturbed, so I would retire to my room and rest. The kind woman insisted on me having a cup of tea. After that, I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to execute a plan I had devised on my way home. I wanted to understand what had caused that peculiar feeling of unreality while I was observing the doctor examine the body. First, I laid down on the floor in the position of the deceased, then I placed a bolster down in my place, and proceeded to replicate, to the best of my memory, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I finished, I had achieved my goal. I sat back on my heels and furrowed my brow at the opposite walls. There was a brief mention in the evening papers of a man who had died in the Tube, and there was uncertainty whether it was suicide or an accident. That made it clear to me what my duty was, and when Mr. Flemming heard my account, he fully agreed with me. “Certainly you will be needed at the inquest. You mentioned no one else was close enough to witness what happened?” “I had a feeling someone was approaching from behind me, but I can't be certain and, in any case, they wouldn't have been as near as I was.” The inquest took place. Mr. Flemming handled all the arrangements and accompanied me. He appeared to be worried that it would be very trying for me, and I had to hide from him my complete calmness. The deceased was identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing was discovered in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow. It was under the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel. The hotel bureau clerk recognized the man as having arrived the previous day and reserved a room under that name. He had registered as L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He had apparently come directly from the steamer. I was the sole person who had witnessed any part of the incident. “You believe it was an accident?” the coroner inquired of me. “I am certain of it. Something startled him, and he stepped backward unknowingly without considering what he was doing.” “But what could have startled him?” “That I do not know. But there was something. He appeared terrified.” A phlegmatic juryman proposed that some men were frightened of cats. The man might have seen a cat. I did not find his suggestion very clever, but it appeared to satisfy the jury, who were evidently eager to leave and more than willing to deliver a verdict of accident rather than suicide. “It is puzzling to me,” remarked the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward. His name and address should have been taken at the time. It was quite irregular not to do so.” I smiled to myself. I had my own hypothesis regarding the doctor. In line with it, I resolved to pay a visit to Scotland Yard at an early opportunity. However, the next morning brought a surprise. The Flemmings subscribed to the Daily Budget, and the Daily Budget was having a field day. SHOCKING FOLLOW-UP TO TUBE INCIDENT. WOMAN DISCOVERED STABBED IN SECLUDED HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A dramatic revelation was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, owned by Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is available for rent unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the possession of the man who was initially believed to have taken his own life by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. In an upper room of the Mill House, the body of a gorgeous young woman was found yesterday, strangled. She is believed to be a foreigner, but her identity has yet to be established. The authorities reportedly have a lead. Sir Eustace Pedler, the proprietor of the Mill House, is spending the winter on the Riviera.” No one stepped forward to identify the deceased woman. The inquest brought to light the following details. Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a faint foreign accent visited the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, property agents, in Knightsbridge. She indicated her interest in renting or purchasing a house on the Thames within close proximity to London. Several options were presented to her, including the details of the Mill House. She provided the name Mrs. de Castina and her address as the Ritz, but there was no guest by that name at the hotel, and the hotel staff could not identify the woman. Mrs. James, the spouse of Sir Eustace Pedler’s gardener, who served as the caretaker for the Mill House and resided in the small lodge near the main road, gave her testimony. Around three o’clock that afternoon, a lady arrived to inspect the house. She presented an order from the estate agents, and, as was customary, Mrs. James handed her the keys to the house. It was located a distance away from the lodge, and she did not typically accompany potential tenants. Shortly after, a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a tanned complexion and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and wore a brown suit.",1
"""I might as well be dead and done with it."" ""I appreciate the favor. There's no escaping it. I saved your life and I expect some gratitude."" If glares could kill, he would have murdered me on the spot. He shoved past me aggressively. Pausing at the door, he looked back and spoke dismissively. ""I won't thank you now or ever. But I won't forget the favor. One day, I'll repay it."" With that, he disappeared, leaving me with clenched fists and a racing heart. The rest of the night was uneventful. The next morning, I had breakfast in bed and woke up late. Mrs.",1
"""Why did he choose yesterday to abruptly send the chauffeur on holiday? Was it because he wanted him out of the way before we arrived?"" Françoise had already exited the room. The magistrate sat silently, tapping his fingers on the table. After a moment, he spoke, ""M. Bex, we are faced with conflicting testimonies. Who should we trust, Françoise or Denise?"" The commissary didn't hesitate, ""Denise. She was the one who allowed the visitor to enter. Françoise's age and stubbornness have clouded her judgment, especially towards Madame Daubreuil. And our investigation suggests that Renauld was involved with another woman."" Suddenly, M. Hautet exclaimed, ""Well, well!""",1
"Poirot's revelation left us stunned. It seemed that Mr. Davenheim, the famous financier, had orchestrated his own disappearance to avoid the consequences of his financial misdeeds. The evidence pointed to a carefully planned scheme involving the theft of jewels and the creation of a false identity. As Poirot calmly explained his theory, it became clear that Mr. Davenheim had outwitted us all, hiding in plain sight where no one would think to look - in a prison. This unexpected turn of events shed a new light on the case, leaving us in awe of Poirot's brilliant deductive skills.",1
"We drove past the town and reached a fork in the road. A peasant directed us to the Villa Geneviève, but as we looked for it, a girl caught our attention. She was a vision of beauty, with a golden head and anxious eyes. Poirot and I were intrigued by her presence. Suddenly, we were stopped by a sergent de ville who delivered the shocking news of Mr. Renauld's murder. Poirot sprang into action, seeking answers from the authorities. The commissary welcomed us and Poirot revealed that the victim had foreseen his own demise. As we entered the Villa, the examining magistrate was ready to begin his investigations. The crime had occurred in the early hours of the morning, and the mystery was waiting to be unraveled.",1
"It was meticulous work, requiring careful planning and execution. The perpetrator had gone to great lengths to cover his tracks, disguising himself with a false beard and wig before carrying out the crime. The victim, Count Foscatini, had been found brutally murdered in his own flat, the murder weapon a marble statuette left lying nearby. The scene was eerily quiet, with the unfinished meal on the table suggesting that the crime had taken place during dinner. The doctor quickly confirmed that the victim had been killed instantly, leaving little chance for help to arrive in time.",1
"""I rolled my eyes, a hint of irritation creeping in. “But don't worry, my friend,” Poirot reassured, his tone softening. “Not everyone can be as extraordinary as Hercule Poirot! I am fully aware of that.” “You really do have a high opinion of yourself,” I remarked, torn between amusement and exasperation. “What can I say? When one is truly unique, one cannot help but know it! And from what I gather, others seem to agree, including, if I'm not mistaken, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “No doubt about it. She's on her way here.” “How do you know that?” “It's quite simple.",1
"""I will definitely be there,"" I said icily. ""It's quite possible. We may end up traveling together."" ""I might just decide to stay a bit longer at the Falls,"" I replied vaguely. Race seems quite eager for me to go to Jo'burg. I suspect he has his eyes set on Anne. ""What are your intentions, Miss Anne?"" ""That's still up in the air,"" she responded coyly, imitating me. ""I thought you were my secretary,"" I pointed out. ""Oh, but I seem to have been replaced. You've been busy with Miss Pettigrew all afternoon."" ""No matter what I've been up to, I can guarantee it wasn't that,"" I reassured her. It was Thursday night. We had just departed from Kimberley. Race was recounting the tale of the diamond theft once again. Why do women get so worked up over anything related to diamonds? Anne Beddingfeld has finally revealed her true identity. Turns out, she's a journalist. She sent a lengthy cable from De Aar this morning. It sounded like she was reading all her exclusive articles for years to come in Mrs. Blair's cabin, with plenty of chatter going on all night. She claims to have been pursuing ""The Man in the Brown Suit"" all along. Although she didn't spot him on the Kilmorden, she's now busy sending home cables about her journey with the murderer and concocting elaborate stories of their interactions. She's quite clever. On her own, she managed to uncover the identity of the woman who was killed in my house. According to Anne Beddingfeld, it was a deduction in the Sherlock Holmes style. However, it seems she cabled Nasby with this information as if it were a proven fact. Women and their intuitions. I have no doubt Anne Beddingfeld is correct in her assumptions, but calling it a deduction is a stretch. How she landed a job at the Daily Budget is beyond me. But she's the type of woman who pulls these things off effortlessly. Impossible to resist her charms. She's already managed to sneak onto my private car. I'm starting to piece together the reason why. Race mentioned that the police suspect Rayburn might head to Rhodesia. He could have easily slipped away on Monday's train. They telegraphed all along the line, but no one fitting his description was found. He's probably disguised himself expertly, and Anne Beddingfeld is hot on his trail. She's eager to be the one to uncover him, for her own glory and the Daily Budget's. Young women these days are ruthless. I hinted to her that it was unbecoming behavior. She just laughed it off, claiming that if she did catch him, her future would be secure. Race doesn't seem pleased either. Perhaps Rayburn is on this very train. If so, we might all end up meeting a grim fate. I mentioned this to Mrs. Blair, who seemed rather excited at the prospect, suggesting it would be a fantastic scoop for Anne if I were to meet such a fate. Quite a scoop indeed! Tomorrow, we'll be passing through Bechuanaland. The dust will be unbearable. And at every stop, young Kafir children come to sell their charming wooden carvings. I'm a bit concerned that Mrs. Blair might go overboard with her purchases. It's Friday evening now. Mrs. Blair and Anne have acquired a whopping forty-nine wooden animals!""",1
"""Yet, I know he can be found there. You may not comprehend now, but I will reveal everything in due time. Trust me, this trip to Paris is crucial. I won't be gone for long. Most likely, I'll be back by tomorrow. I don't suggest you come along. Stay here and watch over Giraud. Also, spend time with M. Renauld's son. And if you wish, try to win over Mademoiselle Marthe's affections. Though, I doubt you'll have much luck."" The final comment didn't sit well with me. ""Speaking of which,"" I mentioned.",1
"""You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “Eh bien, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, mon ami, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air. On the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car had been sent to meet us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit. “Since it is carte blanche, we will hire a car,” he said cheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of Merlinville. My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings. It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition a je ne sais quoi!” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction. “The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “Ça commence!” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “Mon ami, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I ” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing sergent de ville. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.” “But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I cried. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, isn’t it?” “Yes, monsieur, but ” Poirot leaned forward. “But what?” “M. Renauld was murdered this morning.” In a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with excitement. He caught the man by the shoulder. “What is that you say? Murdered? When? How?” The sergent de ville drew himself up. “I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.” “True. I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The Commissary of Police, he is without doubt within?” “Yes, monsieur.” Poirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it. “Voilà! Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The sergent de ville saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me. “This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman. “So he foresaw his own murder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come inside.” He held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M. Bex continued to talk: “The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has just finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin his interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most sympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.” “When was the crime committed?” asked Poirot. “The body was discovered this morning about nine o’clock. Madame Renauld’s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death must have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.” We had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the Villa. In the hall another sergent de ville was sitting. He rose at sight of the commissary. “Where is M. Hautet now?” inquired the latter. “In the salon, monsieur.” M. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. M. Hautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. They looked up as we entered. The commissary introduced us, and explained our presence. M. Hautet, the Juge d’Instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing dark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of caressing as he talked. Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man, with slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand. “Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished speaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?” Poirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.” “Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.” “What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.” “And last night?” “I fastened it as usual.” “You are sure of that?” “I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.” “What time would that be?” “The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.” “What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?” “Madame had retired some time before. Denise and Léonie went up with me. Monsieur was still in his study.” “Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?” Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. “What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out ” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “Cette dame? What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.”",1
"""Looking down at the body, he furrowed his brow. ""Would you classify this individual as Spanish?"" he inquired abruptly. Studying the features intently, I finally replied, ""No, without a doubt I would identify him as French."" Giraud expressed his dissatisfaction with a grunt. ""I concur."" After a brief pause, he motioned for me to step aside with authority and resumed his meticulous search of the shed floor on all fours. His attention to detail was exceptional. Methodically, he combed through every inch of the area, scrutinizing pots and inspecting old sacks.""",1
"""Ha!” exclaimed the inspector, slamming his hand onto the desk. “You dare play games with the authorities, do you? I insist you reveal the identity of the woman who visited Mr. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police, the police,” muttered Françoise. “I never imagined I would get involved with the police. But I know exactly who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissioner gasped in shock and leaned in closer. “Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite nearby?” “Exactly, sir,” Françoise confirmed.",1
"""Indeed,"" Poirot remarked with a hint of disdain. ""Even in Santiago, they possess that knowledge. Even the most inexperienced English Miss is aware of it, thanks to the extensive publicity the Bertillon system has received in the media. Nevertheless, the absence of finger-prints intrigues me greatly. It is astonishingly simple to plant another person's prints. And the authorities are satisfied."" He sighed. ""I suspect our culprit lacks a systematic approach, or perhaps was rushed. Time will tell."" With that, he gently returned the body to its initial pose.",1
"I received a message from Suzanne upon the birth of her child: “Congrats and love to the newest addition to Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to let Suzanne get away with that. I responded with a single word, concise and direct: “Platycephalic!” There is a popular story about a writer who sought to start his tale in a striking and unique manner to captivate even the most jaded of editors, writing: “‘Hell!’ exclaimed the Duchess.",1
"""My heart went out to the secretary, as his words seemed to relieve a hidden burden from my heart. “I believe many share your sentiments,” I declared. “There is hardly any concrete evidence against him. I am confident of his acquittal, without a shadow of doubt.” Stonor’s reaction was not as enthusiastic as I had hoped. “I wish I could share your optimism,” he said solemnly. Turning to Poirot, he inquired, “What do you think, monsieur?” “The situation appears rather bleak,” Poirot replied calmly. “Do you think he’s guilty?” Stonor asked sharply. “No. But proving his innocence will be a challenge,” Poirot responded. “His behavior is quite strange,” Stonor muttered. “There is certainly more to this case than meets the eye. Giraud may not see it, being an outsider, but the whole situation is peculiar. Let’s not dwell on it. If Mrs. Renauld wishes to keep things under wraps, I will respect her wishes. It’s her call, and I trust her judgment. However, I can’t fathom Jack’s attitude. It’s almost as if he wants to be seen as guilty.” “But that’s absurd,” I interjected. “For instance, the dagger...” I hesitated, unsure of how much Poirot wanted me to disclose. Carefully choosing my words, I continued, “We are aware that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld is aware of this.” “Indeed,” Stonor agreed. “She will likely confirm this and more once she regains consciousness. Well, I must take my leave now.” “Just a moment.” Poirot halted his exit. “Could you ensure that I am notified immediately if Madame Renauld regains consciousness?” “Of course. Consider it done.” “Your observation about the dagger is astute, Poirot,” I mentioned as we headed upstairs. “I couldn’t speak freely in front of Stonor.” “You were right to be cautious. It’s best to keep certain information to ourselves for now. Regarding the dagger, it doesn’t bode well for Jack Renauld. Remember when I was absent for an hour this morning before leaving London?” “Yes?” “I was tracing the company that Jack Renauld had commissioned to make his souvenirs. It wasn’t a difficult task. Well, Hastings, they produced not two paper-knives as ordered, but three.” “So?” “So, after giving one to his mother and another to Bella Duveen, there was a third that he likely kept for himself. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger issue won’t aid us in saving him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I protested. Poirot shook his head doubtfully. “You will find a way,” I insisted. Poirot looked at me dryly. “You’re asking for miracles, mon ami. Say no more. Let’s focus on this letter instead.” Retrieving an envelope from his pocket, he read it with a pained expression before passing the single sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who are suffering, Hastings.” The handwriting was shaky, indicating great distress: “Dear M. Poirot: “If you receive this, I implore you to come to my aid.""",1
"""Despite their efforts to escape, Nemesis caught up with them in the end. When news broke of the tragic Air Mail crash to Paris claiming the lives of the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering, I felt a sense of justice prevailing. 'There seems to be a surge in bond robberies recently,' I remarked one morning, setting aside the newspaper. 'Poirot, let's leave the art of detection behind and venture into the world of crime instead!' 'Are you trying to get rich quick, my friend?' 'Just consider the latest heist, the million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds en route from London and Scottish Bank to New York, vanishing mysteriously aboard the Olympia.'""",1
"""I've always heard that he acquired his wealth in a secretive manner,"" mused Suzanne. ""But that doesn't necessarily imply criminal activity. It could be something as mundane as selling office supplies or beauty products!"" I responded with a hint of regret. ""Perhaps,"" Suzanne hesitated, ""we're on the wrong track? What if we're being misled by suspecting Pagett's involvement? What if he's truly an upright citizen?"" I pondered this briefly before shaking my head. ""I find that hard to believe."" ""He does have an explanation for everything."" ""True, but they lack credibility.""",1
"I know what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still,” I began, and stopped. “Still as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my conscience horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be acquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he was not.… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son, who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily. So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear. We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Eh bien, speaking frankly in confidence, c’est entendu can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with empressement. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot. “It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows. They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my er experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “Pardon! But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “Toqué!” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “Toqué!” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting. Eh bien, once or twice, your manner has annoyed me.” “I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.” “He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “Dear M. Poirot: “If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn to, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees to help us. “MARTHE DAUBREUIL.” I handed it back, moved. “You will go?” “At once. We will command an auto.” Half an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the door to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of his. “Ah, you have come it is good of you. I have been in despair, not knowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even. I suffer horribly, I am nearly mad. Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down like that.” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he but what do men care if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.” “Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, petite, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound. When he had finished, she drew a long breath. “But you are wonderful magnificent! You are the greatest detective in the world.” With a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French. “Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so.",1
"""Is there any connection between the four that we are missing?"" ""I'm not following."" ""Let me be direct. Did those four men do anything that could be seen as disrespectful to Men-her-Ra?"" The doctor stared at Poirot in disbelief. ""You can't be serious, Monsieur Poirot. You're not actually buying into that nonsense, are you?"" Willard was growing frustrated. Poirot, with his green cat-like eyes, remained calm and unmoving. ""So you don't believe it, doctor?"" ""Absolutely not. I trust in science, not superstition,"" the doctor stated firmly.",1
"I'll be curious to see if the tools are from the Mousterian period. There will likely be remains of the primitive ox, but probably not of the woolly rhinoceros. A small group will be leaving soon. We need to stay ahead of them. Will you send a letter to Cook’s today, Anne?” “What about finances, dad?” I asked subtly. He gave me a disapproving look. “Your perspective always brings me down, my dear. We mustn't be materialistic. No, no, one mustn't be materialistic in the pursuit of knowledge.” “I have a feeling Cook’s might be materialistic, dad.” Dad looked hurt. “My dear Anne, you will settle the bill with cash.”",1
"Mrs. Havering had been searching for a new housekeeper and had interviewed several candidates. However, when she sent the engagement fee, she failed to inform them of her decision. Disappointed, I returned to London where I found Poirot lounging in a flamboyant silk robe. He welcomed me warmly, expressing his fondness for me. ""My dear Hastings, how delightful to see you! Have you had a good time? Have you been assisting Japp and conducting your own investigations?"" ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""this case is shrouded in darkness! It seems unsolvable.""",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had captivated Paris, gracefully acknowledged the applause and disappeared backstage. Her dressing room was filled with bouquets and luxurious garments, as Jeanne, her dresser, chattered on. A knock at the door interrupted them. The mysterious Count Sergius Paulovitch had arrived, a man of elegance and weariness. Switching to English, they discussed the 'Colonel,' a criminal mastermind planning his retirement. Nadina revealed her plan to travel to London incognito, arousing the Count's curiosity. He mentioned a fortune teller's prophecy about the 'Colonel's' downfall involving a woman, sparking Nadina's interest. They speculated on the 'Colonel's' future and the mysteries that lay ahead.",1
"“Last time we met,” I began, “you were walking back with your sister, such a well-behaved child. Speaking of which, how is she doing?” A gleaming smile was my answer. “Thank you for asking! My sister is in good health.” “Is she accompanying you today?” “No,” the minx replied haughtily. “She decided to stay in town.” I chuckled. “I highly doubt you even have a sister. And if you do, her name must be Harris!” “Do you recall mine?” she inquired, a smirk playing on her lips. “Cinderella. But now you'll reveal your true name, won't you?” She shook her head mischievously. “Not even for why you're here?” “Ah, that! I assume you've heard about individuals in my line of work taking a break.”",1
"""Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.” “I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.” “You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?” “No, doctor, I’m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you’ll see, something will turn up! You’ll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.” My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa’s London solicitor. He came down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it.",1
"I pondered what to do with a man of his nature. ""If it's too shameful to share with me,"" I started with malice. Finally, I hit a nerve. Pagett tensed up and turned red. ""Shameful? Ashamed? I'm lost."" ""Then explain it to me."" In just three sentences, he spilled the beans. And there it was, Pagett's hidden truth revealed! It was nothing like I had anticipated. I made my way back to the hotel in a daze. A telegram was waiting for me. I ripped it apart.",1
"""I am conducting an investigation into the passing of Mr. Renauld. Surely, you are aware of it?"" She nodded silently, her face remaining impassive. ""We have come to inquire if you might shed some light on the events surrounding it?"" ""Me?"" Her tone conveyed genuine surprise. ""Indeed, madam. It would be preferable if we could converse in private."" He gestured discreetly towards the young woman. Madame Daubreuil glanced at her. ""Marthe, my dear."" But the young woman refused. ""No, mother, I will stay. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I have no intention of leaving."" Madame Daubreuil then redirected her attention to the investigator.",1
"""Marvelous!"" he whispered. ""May I?"" He reached for the jewel, examining it closely before returning it with a slight nod. ""An impeccable gem. Ah, what a marvel! And you carry it so casually, just like that!""""No, no, Monsieur Poirot, I am very cautious. Normally, it's locked in my jewel case, kept in the hotel safe. We're at the Magnificent, as you know. I only brought it today for you to admire.""""And you will leave it with me, won't you? You will heed Papa Poirot's advice?""""Well, you see, Monsieur Poirot, on Friday we are heading to Yardly Chase to spend some time with Lord and Lady Yardly.""Her words sparked a memory in my mind. Some gossip... what was it? Lord and Lady Yardly had visited the States a few years ago, rumors of his wild lifestyle with some lady friends. But there was more, a scandal linking Lady Yardly to a Hollywood star in California - Gregory B. Rolf. ""I'll tell you a secret, Monsieur Poirot,"" Miss Marvell continued. ""We are negotiating with Lord Yardly to film a play at his estate.""""At Yardly Chase?"" I exclaimed, intrigued. ""It's a renowned location in England.""Miss Marvell nodded. ""It's the epitome of old feudal charm. He's asking for a high price, and we're not sure if the deal will go through. But Greg and I always mix business with pleasure.""""But forgive me if I am mistaken, madame, can't you visit Yardly Chase without the diamond?"" A sharp look crossed Miss Marvell's face, giving her a more mature appearance. ""I want to wear it there.""""Indeed,"" I said suddenly, ""Yardly's collection includes some famous jewels, a large diamond among them?""""That's right,"" Miss Marvell responded shortly. Poirot muttered, ""Ah, c'est la vie!"" Then, with his usual intuition, he remarked, ""You must be familiar with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?""""Gregory met her when she was in the West three years ago,"" Miss Marvell answered. She paused before adding abruptly, ""Do either of you follow Society Gossip?""We both admitted guiltily. ""I ask because this week's issue has an article on famous jewels, very intriguing,"" she said, stopping abruptly. Poirot murmured, ""Marvelous! A tale of romance, no doubt."" He turned to Miss Marvell. ""And you're not afraid, madame? No superstitions? No fear of uniting these two twin jewels, fearing a Chinaman might appear and spirit them away to China?""""I don't think Lady Yardly's diamond is as valuable as mine,"" Miss Marvell retorted. ""But I intend to find out.""Before Poirot could say more, the door burst open, and a handsome man entered. From his stylish appearance, he seemed like a character from a novel. ""I promised to pick you up, Mary,"" Gregory Rolf said. ""Here I am. What does Monsieur Poirot think of our little predicament? Just a big hoax, like I do?""Poirot smiled at the actor. They made an odd pair. ""Whether hoax or not, Mr. Rolf,"" Poirot remarked dryly, ""I've advised your wife not to take the jewel to Yardly Chase on Friday.""""I agree, sir. I already told Mary that. But she's a woman, can't stand the thought of being outshone in jewelry,"" Gregory said. ""What nonsense, Gregory!"" Mary Marvell snapped, her cheeks flushed. Poirot shrugged. ""Madame, I've given my advice. That's all I can do. It's done."" He escorted them to the door. ""Ah, women's tales,"" he mused, returning. ""The good husband struck the right chord, not very tactful though!"" I shared my hazy recollections with him, and he nodded. ""Indeed, there's something peculiar beneath the surface. With your permission, my friend, I'll take a stroll. Await my return, please.""",1
"""If he can explain that, we're on the right track,"" he said, rising from his seat. ""It's late. Go to bed, Anne, and get some rest. Just before dawn, I'll take you across the river in the canoe. You need to catch the train in Livingstone. I have a friend there who will keep you safe until your train departs. From Livingstone, you'll head to Bulawayo and catch the train to Beira. I'll gather information from my friend in Livingstone about the situation at the hotel and the whereabouts of your friends.""""Beira,"" I mused. ""Yes, Anne, Beira it is. Let me handle this. It's man's work,"" he assured me. We had a brief break from the intense emotions that had consumed us, but they were back now. Without a word, I headed into the hut. I lay down on the couch, unable to sleep, while outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing back and forth through the dark hours. Suddenly, he called out to me, ""Come, Anne, it's time."" I got up and joined him outside. It was still dark, but dawn was approaching. ""We'll take the canoe, not the motorboat,"" Harry started, before pausing abruptly and holding up his hand. ""Listen,"" he whispered. I strained my ears and heard the faint sound of paddles in the water. It was coming from the right bank of the river, getting closer to our landing-stage. In the darkness, we saw a boat approaching, with the figure of the red-bearded Dutchman and several natives on board. ""Back to the hut,"" Harry commanded, grabbing a couple of rifles and a revolver. ""Can you load a rifle?"" he asked me. ""I've never done it. Show me,"" I replied. As we braced ourselves inside, Harry stood by the window overlooking the landing-stage. The boat was about to reach it when Harry shouted, ""Who goes there?"" Bullets began to rain down on us, but we managed to avoid being hit. Harry returned fire, hitting two of our assailants. ""They'll be back. Get ready,"" he told me, kissing me fiercely before focusing on the window again. As the attackers regrouped, Harry praised my bravery. ""Now, get the paraffin tins,"" he instructed. We made our way to the roof of the hut, carrying the paraffin with us. ""We have to cross to the other side of the island,"" Harry said urgently as we spotted the approaching boats. But to our horror, both boats had been cut adrift. ""We're in trouble,"" Harry muttered. As the enemies closed in, we raced across the island towards the water. ""We have to swim for it,"" Harry declared. I hesitated at the mention of crocodiles. ""Crocs, that's the danger,"" he confirmed. Despite the risk, we plunged into the water and made it to the other side safely. Wet and exhausted, we began our journey to Livingstone, facing rough terrain and obstacles along the way. By the time we arrived, the first light of dawn was breaking, and Harry's friend, a young man with a store of native curios, greeted us.",1
"The silence was eerie, broken only by the rumble of our car, a vintage Ford that looked like it had seen better days. The upholstery was in tatters, and even my limited knowledge of engines told me that something was seriously wrong under the hood. As we drove on, the landscape transformed, with massive boulders rising up in surreal formations. It felt as though we had wandered into a prehistoric world, where giants once roamed. Lost in thought, I glanced at Colonel Race and murmured, ""There must have been giants once.""",1
"I was taken aback when he unexpectedly revealed that Ascanio himself would be visiting him at eleven o’clock. “He’s coming to consult you?” I asked. “Not at all, Hastings. I wish to consult him,” was his surprising response. “Regarding what?” I inquired. “The Regent’s Court murder.” “Are you planning to prove his guilt?” I asked. “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Use your common sense. Ah, here he is now,” he said as the doorbell rang. Shortly after, Signor Ascanio arrived - a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive gaze, casting suspicious looks around the room.",1
"""A clandestine rendezvous for instructions!"" ""Do not hiss in my direction, Pagett,"" I remarked, taking a step back, ""and please regulate your breath. Your suggestion is preposterous. What reason would they have for arranging a covert meeting in the dead of night? If they had anything to discuss, they could easily converse over a cup of tea in a nonchalant and ordinary manner."" Despite my arguments, it was clear that Pagett remained unconvinced. ""Something definitely occurred last night, Sir Eustace,"" he insisted, ""otherwise why would Rayburn viciously attack me."" ""You are positive it was Rayburn?"" Pagett seemed entirely certain of that detail. It was the one aspect of his account that lacked ambiguity.",1
"“No. 13 on Deck D?” I exclaimed in horror. “Absolutely not, I refuse to stay in that cabin.” Superstition had always been my weakness, and the thought of being in cabin 13 sent shivers down my spine. Reluctantly, I pleaded with the steward, “Please, tell me there is another available cabin.” After a moment of contemplation, the steward suggested, “What about cabin 17? It’s just down the starboard side. It was unoccupied this morning, but I suspect it may have been assigned by now. However, since the gentleman hasn’t moved in yet, he might not mind switching.” Eagerly, I accepted the offer and the steward went off to seek approval from the purser.",1
"So long as there was only one weapon, the suspicion would not fall on the girl who possessed the second paper-knife. He valiantly protected the woman he once loved, but at what cost to himself! I started to comprehend the enormity of the task I had assigned to Poirot. Securing Jack Renauld's acquittal would not be simple without revealing the truth. M. Hautet's biting words cut through the air: “Madame Renauld claimed the dagger was on her dressing table the night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It may surprise you, Renauld, but I believe it is highly likely that she was mistaken, and that you inadvertently took it with you to Paris. You may disagree with me ” The lad's cuffed hands clenched as he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice: “I will not dispute you. It is possible.” It was a shocking moment. Maître Grosíer stood up, stating: “My client is under immense stress. I must note that I do not hold him accountable for his words.” The magistrate silenced him angrily. A moment of doubt flickered in his mind. Jack Renauld was pushing the boundaries. Leaning forward, the magistrate fixed his gaze on the prisoner: “Do you understand, Renauld, that based on your answers, I have no choice but to send you to trial?” Jack's face reddened. He stared back resolutely. “M. Hautet, I swear I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate's hesitation was brief. He let out a short, unpleasant laugh. “Innocence is always claimed by prisoners! By your own admission, you are guilty. You have no defense, no alibi, only a feeble assertion that you are not guilty. You murdered your father, Renauld, a cruel and cowardly act for money you believed would be yours at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. She may receive leniency due to her maternal role, which you will not. Your crime is abhorrent, deserving of condemnation by all!” M. Hautet relished the moment, immersed in the pomp of justice. “You committed the crime, now face the consequences. I speak to you not as a man, but as eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet's speech was abruptly interrupted. The door swung open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” the attendant stuttered, “there is a lady who says who says ” “What does she say?” the irritated magistrate snapped. “This is highly irregular. I forbid it absolutely forbid it.” Ignoring the stammering gendarme, a slender figure in black, with a long veil covering her face, entered the room. My heart sank. She had arrived! All my efforts had been in vain. Yet I couldn't help but admire her courage. She lifted her veil and I gasped. This girl resembled Cinderella, but was not her! Without the fair wig, I recognized her as the girl from the photograph in Jack Renauld's room. “Are you the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she asked. “Yes, but I forbid ” “My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to confess to the murder of Mr. Renauld.”",1
"""Excuse me."" ""Yes?"" ""Well, he was then forced to disguise himself with a fake beard and wig, had to transform back into his own appearance, and sleeping with a fake beard is no simple task as it increases the risk of being discovered! He could not take the chance of still sharing a room with his wife, Mrs. Davenheim. You confirmed my suspicions that for the past six months, or since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, they had been staying in separate rooms. That was the final piece of the puzzle! The gardener who thought he spotted his employer heading towards the side of the house was indeed correct.""",1
"“Believe it or not, I had a dream where we stumbled upon Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and you accused her of killing Mr. Renauld,” I said. “That wasn’t a dream. It actually happened,” Poirot confirmed.“But Bella Duveen confessed to the murder, didn’t she?” “No, my dear Hastings, she did not. She took the blame to protect her lover from the death penalty.”“What?” “Think back to Jack Renauld’s account. They both arrived at the crime scene simultaneously, each mistaking the other for the killer. The girl, horrified, fled with a scream.”",1
"""It was frustrating missing out on Cabin 17, and it concerned me not being able to figure you out. Were you truly the innocent young girl you portrayed, or were you something else entirely?

""But why was the radio message referring to 'seventeen' instead of 'seventy-one'?"" ""I have a theory. Carton likely provided the wireless operator with his notes to transcribe onto a form, but he never double-checked the copy. The operator, just like the rest of us, misinterpreted it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.""",1
"I had never seen anything quite like Cinderella. Her obsession with morbid excitement was palpable, overshadowing her youthful appearance. Despite her beauty, there was a ghoulish aspect to her that gave me pause. As we explored the crime scene together, she displayed a brashness that both intrigued and unsettled me. The discovery of the victim's body seemed to have a profound effect on her, stripping away her carefree demeanor to reveal a raw vulnerability. It was a stark reminder of the darkness that lurks beneath the surface, waiting to be unearthed. In that moment, she was no longer the daring girl I had known, but a frightened soul seeking solace in a world haunted by shadows.",1
"""He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course.""",1
"""Rest assured, peace of mind will not come easily,” “Very well, I concur! You mention my disrespectful demeanor towards you. Well, on a few occasions, your behavior has irked me.” “I am pleased to hear it,” Poirot responded. “Good day, M. Giraud. Let's go, Hastings.” Walking in silence, my heart weighed heavily. Poirot had made his intentions glaringly clear. Doubts grew about my ability to rescue Bella from the aftermath of her actions. The unexpected encounter with Giraud had provoked Poirot and heightened his determination. Suddenly, a hand rested on my shoulder, and I turned to find Gabriel Stonor. We exchanged greetings and he suggested a leisurely walk back to our hotel.",1
"But, at that moment, where was Poirot? I watched him closely. He projected an air of innocence, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. His calm demeanor seemed too serene and relaxed to offer any comfort. Through my experience with Poirot, I had come to realize that the more harmless he appeared, the more dangerous he actually was. His tranquility unsettled me. Sensing my unease, he smiled kindly. ""You seem perplexed, Hastings? Wondering why I haven't taken action?"" ""Something along those lines."" ""That's what you would do if you were in my shoes. I get it.""",1
"“Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it.",1

"""No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” “More than unlikely impossible!” said Poirot quietly. “Eh?” The inspector stared. Poirot smiled modestly. “I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case. I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say ‘Go!’” “Go!” I said. With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning. “Well, mon ami?” he demanded of me breathlessly. “Forty-six seconds,” I replied. “You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.” “Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door. Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen. “This necklace it was, without doubt, insured?” Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question. “Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.” “But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.” ""I comprehend, madame,"" said Poirot soothingly. ""I comprehend perfectly. To la femme sentiment is everything is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtlessly find some slight consolation in the fact."" ""Of course, of course,"" said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. ""Still"" He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers. With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman. ""Oh, oh, my necklace!"" She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round. “Where was it?” demanded Opalsen. “Maid’s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.” ""You permit, madame?"" said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow. ""I'm afraid, madam, you'll have to hand it over to us for the time being,"" said the inspector. ""We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible."" Mr. Opalsen frowned. ""Is that necessary?"" ""I'm afraid so, sir. Just a formality."" ""Oh, let him take it, Ed!"" cried his wife. ""I’d feel safer if he did. I shouldn’t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed it of her."" ""There, there, my dear, don't take on so."" I felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot. ""Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer needed."" Once outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise, he remarked: ""I should rather like to see the room next door."" The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a large double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably, and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window. ""The service leaves to be desired,"" he observed dryly. He was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have fallen into a brown study. ""Well?"" I demanded impatiently. ""What did we come in here for?"" He started. ""Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also."" ""Well,"" I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left, ""it is bolted."" Poirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking. ""And, anyway,"" I continued, ""what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you'd had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn't go wrong over."" Poirot shook his head. ""The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls."" ""But the maid did!"" ""Why do you say that?"" ""Why,"" I stammered, ""they were found actually in her mattress."" ""Ta, ta, ta!"" said Poirot impatiently. ""Those were not the pearls."" ""What?"" ""Imitation, mon ami."" The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. ""The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!"" ""Come!"" I cried, dragging at his arm. ""Where?"" ""We must tell the Opalsens at once."" ""I think not."" ""But that poor woman"" ""Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe."" ""But the thief may escape with them!"" ""As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?"" ""Oh!"" I said, bewildered. ""Exactly,"" said Poirot, beaming. ""We start again."" He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.",1
"I didn’t believe his idea was very clever, but the jury seemed eager to leave and happy to declare the death an accident instead of suicide. “I find it quite odd,” the coroner remarked, “that the initial doctor did not step forward. His details should have been recorded immediately. It was highly irregular not to do so.” I smirked inwardly. I had my suspicions about the doctor. With that in mind, I decided to pay a visit to Scotland Yard soon. However, the following day held a shock.",1
"As universally agreed, they conversed in English, revealing the Count's true origins now that his facade had faded away. It was known that he had once thrived as a quick-change performer in London's music halls. ""You excelled tonight,"" he acknowledged. ""My compliments to you."" ""Nevertheless,"" the woman confessed, ""I am uneasy. My status is precarious. The doubts sown during the War persist. I am under constant surveillance."" ""Yet you were never formally accused of espionage?"" ""Our leader is too meticulous for that."" ""Here's to the 'Colonel,'"" the Count toasted, with a grin on his face.",1
"""Was it Sir Eustace who underwent a test, or was the tale crafted for my benefit? I recalled feeling like I was being interrogated that night. Colonel Race seemed wary for some reason. But what was his involvement? ""Who exactly is Colonel Race?"" I inquired. ""That's a loaded question,"" Suzanne replied. ""He's famous as a big-game hunter and, as you heard him mention earlier, a distant relative of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I only just met him on this journey.""",1
"""Approximately fifteen minutes later, a tall man with a thick black moustache arrived at the front door claiming to have an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. Identifying himself as Mr. Lowen, he was escorted to the study per the banker's request. Nearly sixty minutes elapsed with no sign of Mr. Davenheim. Frustrated, Mr. Lowen rang the bell, indicating his need to depart in order to catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim, puzzled by her husband's absence despite expecting the visitor, apologized for the situation.""",1
"But it would have been suicide, mon ami! The plan was well laid out. The chloroform to subdue, the morphine to finish. Madame Renauld was the target, but she fought back. Marthe Daubreuil had to improvise. No suicide, but a desperate attempt to escape. The truth came out, not by Poirot's hand, but by a young acrobat. I pondered, when did suspicion first arise? The answer was clear. Marthe's anxious eyes gave her away. She had a motive, a plan, but it all unraveled. Jack Renauld recovered, but Madame Daubreuil vanished. Secrets buried, truths revealed. Jack's future uncertain, but love may prevail. As for me, a new beginning awaits, far from the crimes of the past.",1
"Descending the stairs was Mrs. Renauld, her head bandaged. The French girl was weeping, imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs. Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe. “Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent omelette, and an equally excellent entrecôte to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length café noir had completed the meal. “Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little salon.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say ” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us. I took her hands in both of mine. My eyes said the rest. Poirot cleared his throat. “Mes enfants,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “Très bien, mon enfant,” said Poirot. “I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle ” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot. “I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping that is the great thing. Maman made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest.",1
"I hadn’t meant to disturb him by advertising my presence. But suddenly I heard a light footfall behind me, and his voice broke the silence: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned around. “I want to apologize. I behaved like a boor last night.” “It was a peculiar night,” I replied. “You may not know, but you are in danger,” he warned. “They are ruthless. Your only chance is to persuade them they’re mistaken. Be careful, always be on the lookout for danger. If you fall into their hands, tell the whole truth.” “Why warn me?” I asked. “It may be the last thing I can do for you,” he said. “Goodbye,” he said as he left, his footsteps echoing along the deck. I was left alone, wondering about the danger that lay ahead.",1
"As we knelt beside her, unsure of whether she was dead or alive, her eyes fluttered open. ""The Chinaman,"" she gasped. ""The Chinaman, by the side entrance."" Lord Yardly jumped to his feet, cursing. I followed him, heart racing. The Chinaman once more! The side entrance in question was a small door at the corner of the building, just a few yards from where the crime occurred. As we approached, I let out a gasp. There, right at the doorstep, lay the sparkling necklace, dropped by the thief in their haste. I eagerly picked it up. But then I noticed something that made Lord Yardly and I both cry out in shock. The Star of the East was missing from the necklace! ""That confirms it,"" I whispered. ""These were no ordinary thieves. They wanted only that one gem."" ""But how did the intruder gain entry?"" ""Through this very door."" ""But it's always locked."" I shook my head. ""Not anymore. Look."" I pushed it open as I spoke, and a piece of silk fluttered to the ground. It was unmistakably from a Chinaman's robe. ""It got caught in the door in his haste,"" I explained. ""Quickly, let's search. He can't have gone far."" But our search in the darkness proved fruitless. The thief had vanished without a trace. Reluctantly, we returned, and Lord Yardly sent a footman to fetch the authorities. Lady Yardly, under Poirot's care, was well enough to recount her ordeal. ""I was about to switch on the other light,"" she recounted, ""when a man attacked me from behind. He ripped off my necklace with such force that I fell to the ground. As I fell, I saw him fleeing through the side entrance. It was then I noticed his pig-tail and embroidered robe, confirming he was a Chinaman."" She shuddered. The butler returned with a message for Lord Yardly. ""A visitor from Mr. Hoffberg's, my lord. He's here as expected."" ""Heavens!"" Lord Yardly exclaimed. ""I must see him, I suppose. Not here, Mullings, lead him to the library."" I pulled Poirot aside. ""Perhaps we should return to London,"" I suggested. ""Why?"" Poirot inquired. ""Well,"" I hesitated, ""things haven't exactly gone smoothly, have they? You promised Lord Yardly that all would be resolved, yet the diamond vanished right under your nose!"" Poirot looked crestfallen. ""You're right, Hastings. It was not my finest moment."" His nonchalant attitude almost made me chuckle, but I persisted. ""Considering the situation, wouldn't it be best to leave promptly?"" ""And what about the dinner, the no doubt exquisite dinner prepared by Lord Yardly's chef?"" Poirot raised his hands in dismay. ""Mon Dieu! Your indifference to culinary affairs in this country is criminal."" ""There's another reason to return to London posthaste,"" I continued in a hushed tone. ""And what might that be?"" Poirot asked. ""The other diamond,"" I replied. ""Miss Marvell's."" ""And?"" Poirot seemed puzzled. ""Don't you see?"" I was growing frustrated with his lack of insight.",1
"""Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station."" ""Oh, no, thank you,"" I said hastily. ""Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered."" To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. ""I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!"" ""What has he done now?"" I inquired with some curiosity. ""He’s got hold of a secretary for me.",1
"“It's beyond me! It's just plain stupid! They had everything planned out for the abduction, and it was all well thought out too. But instead of keeping it low-key, they decided to go all out with a melodramatic attack that seemed straight out of a movie. It's hard to take it seriously, with their group of masked men so close to London!” “Maybe there were two different groups trying to pull off the same thing at the same time,” I proposed. “No, that's too much of a coincidence! And besides, someone must have been a traitor in the first place.”",1
"""Urgent matter. Yours faithfully, P. T. RENAULD."" A barely legible plea followed the signature: ""For God’s sake, come!"" Returning the letter, I felt a surge of anticipation. ""Finally, something unusual,"" I remarked. ""Absolutely,"" Poirot concurred thoughtfully. ""You will be going, correct?"" I asked. Poirot nodded, deep in thought. After a moment, he made a decision and checked the time. His expression was serious. ""Time is of the essence. The Continental express departs Victoria at 11 o’clock. No need to fret, we have ample time. Let's take ten minutes to discuss.""",1
"Renauld plans to disguise himself as a tramp and leave town unnoticed after committing the crime. He stages the scene to implicate others and creates a false trail of evidence. However, justice catches up to him in the end. Poirot solves the case by unraveling the deeper mystery behind the crime. The investigation leads to the discovery of a possible witness, Bella Duveen, who may hold the key to solving the case. Poirot's keen observation and deductive skills lead him to the truth, ultimately solving the perplexing and baffling mystery.",1
"""Let them ascend,” declared Poirot, neatly tucking away his grey pants. Within moments, the two guests were shown in, and my pulse quickened as I realized that the first was none other than Lord Estair, Head of the House of Commons; his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I was aware, a trusted confidant of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” inquired Lord Estair. My companion nodded. The distinguished gentleman glanced at me and paused. “This is a matter of confidentiality.” “Feel free to speak in front of Captain Hastings,” my companion reassured, gesturing for me to stay.",1
"It was a strange time. We were cut off from the world, alone together as Adam and Eve might have been but with what a difference! Old Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have done. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much of it as I could manage with one arm. Harry was out a good part of the time, but we spent long hours together lying out in the shade of the palms, talking and quarrelling discussing everything under high heaven, quarrelling and making it up again. We bickered a good deal, but there grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I could never have believed possible. That and something else. The time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough to leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let me go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long moody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by himself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple meal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was sinking. Hairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been able to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my knees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation. I felt rather than saw Harry looking at me. “You look like a witch, Anne,” he said at last, and there was something in his voice that had never been there before. He reached out his hand and just touched my hair. I shivered. Suddenly he sprang up with an oath. “You must leave here to-morrow, do you hear?” he cried. “I I can’t bear any more. I’m only a man after all. You must go, Anne. You must. You’re not a fool. You know yourself that this can’t go on.” “I suppose not,” I said slowly. “But it’s been happy, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been hell!” “As bad as that!” “What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you say that laughing into your hair?” “I wasn’t laughing. And I’m not mocking. If you want me to go, I’ll go. But if you want me to stay I’ll stay.” “Not that!” he cried vehemently. “Not that. Don’t tempt me, Anne. Do you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down. They know me here as Harry Parker they think I’ve been away on a trek up country, but any day they may put two and two together and then the blow will fall. You’re so young, Anne, and so beautiful with the kind of beauty that sends men mad. All the world’s before you love, life, everything. Mine’s behind me scorched, spoiled, with a taste of bitter ashes.” “If you don’t want me” “You know I want you. You know that I’d give my soul to pick you up in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for ever and ever. And you’re tempting me, Anne. You, with your long witch’s hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green and never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I’ll save you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night. You shall go to Beira” “I’m not going to Beira,” I interrupted. “You are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself and throw you on to the boat. What do you think I’m made of? Do you think I’ll wake up night after night, fearing they’ve got you? One can’t go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back to England, Anne and and marry and be happy.” “With a steady man who’ll give me a good home!” “Better that than utter disaster.” “And what of you?” His face grew grim and set. “I’ve got my work ready to hand. Don’t ask what it is. You can guess, I dare say. But I’ll tell you this I’ll clear my name, or die in the attempt, and I’ll choke the life out of the damned scoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.” “We must be fair,” I said. “He didn’t actually push me over.” “He’d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge. He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story. “You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly. “I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track and, my God! that’s the place to know a friend. There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death could have broken. Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were crowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles. I can’t tell you our elation. It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.” “Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then in the hotel at Kimberley we met her” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn’t her game. Sometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn’t been, for Sir Laurence Eardsley’s only son was quite a parti. But the truth of it was that she was married to a sorter in De Beers’ though nobody knew of it. She pretended enormous interests in our discovery, and we told her all about it and even showed her the diamonds. Delilah that’s what she should have been called and she played her part well! “The De Beers robbery was discovered, and like a thunderclap the police came down upon us. They seized our diamonds. We only laughed at first the whole thing was so absurd. And then the diamonds were produced in court and without question they were the stones stolen from De Beers’. Anita Grünberg had disappeared. She had effected the substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not the stones originally in our possession was laughed to scorn. “Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in getting the case dismissed but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer. He cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father’s disbelief. He came out furious from the interview his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me. I had been madly in love with her for the moment I even think that I frightened her sometimes but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead. All I felt was, ‘What’s the good?’ My pal was dead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I was supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful existence here, neither happy nor unhappy numbed of all feeling. I see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was partly the effect of the war. “And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I was taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river, and I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation. It focused my attention on him. He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him. She had got in with a bad lot, he told me and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story. It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter. I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow.",1
"Madame Beroldy was a young and attractive woman, known for her charismatic personality. Rumors circulated about her mysterious background, with some claiming she was the illegitimate child of a Russian Grand Duke while others insisted it was an Austrian Archduke. Despite the speculation, Madame Beroldy neither confirmed nor denied the stories when questioned. Her presence in the quarter caused quite a commotion, leaving many intrigued by the enigma that surrounded her.",1
"“Tell me, did you let Madame Daubreuil into the house last night?” “No, sir, it was the night before.” “But Françoise just said Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, sir. A woman did visit Mr. Renauld last night, but it wasn't Madame Daubreuil.” The magistrate pressed further, but the girl was adamant. She was positive it wasn't Madame Daubreuil. This woman was dark, but shorter and much younger. Her identification was unwavering. “Had you ever seen her before?” “Never, sir.” Then, the girl hesitated and added: “But I believe she was English.”",1
"I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong. When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock something would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time. If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully.",1
"""And now, my dear, you see the consequences of youth and beauty. I have revealed confidential information for you!"" The woman chuckled, then graciously expressed her gratitude. ""I should return home now. My mother will be worried."" With that, she hurried back along the road, resembling a modern-day Atalanta. I gazed in her direction. ""My friend,"" Poirot remarked, his voice tinged with irony, ""are we to remain rooted here all night simply because you have encountered a lovely young lady who has captivated you?"" I chuckled and offered my apologies. ""But she is truly stunning, Poirot. It's hard not to be taken aback by her beauty."" Poirot let out a groan.",1
"""Are you Hassan, the former servant of Sir John Willard?"" ""I was in service to Sir John, now I am in service to his son."" He moved closer, speaking softly. ""You have a reputation for knowledge in the supernatural. Advise the young master to leave. There is malevolence surrounding us."" Without waiting for a response, he walked away abruptly. ""Malevolence in the air,"" murmured Poirot. ""I sense it too."" Our dinner was somber. Dr. Tosswill dominated the conversation with a lecture on ancient Egyptian artifacts.",1
"Bella's unexpected visit threw off his plans. He quickly got rid of her to proceed with his dark deeds. Binding and silencing Madame Renauld, he corrected past mistakes, leaving subtle clues behind. Disguised in an overcoat, he carried out the sinister act under the cover of darkness. The meticulous arrangement of the crime scene pointed directly at him. The final twist of fate came when he met his own demise. Despite the complex web of lies, Poirot unraveled the truth behind the elaborate scheme. The clever manipulation of evidence by the real culprits posed a challenge, but Poirot's keen insight prevailed. The intricate dance of deception and betrayal left a trail of devastation in its wake.",1
"Poirot investigated the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had insured his life for a large sum of money. The cause of death was believed to be internal bleeding, but rumors of financial trouble surrounded the deceased. Poirot, accompanied by his friend Hastings, visited Marsdon Manor to speak with Dr. Bernard, the only doctor in the area. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was questioned about the events leading up to her husband's death. She revealed that he had a premonition of his death and had insured his life because of it. As they were about to leave, a tall young man approached them.",1
"The Villa was cloaked in darkness as we approached Mrs. Renauld's bedroom window. Suddenly, a cry for help pierced the silence, followed by a shadowy struggle. Poirot sprang into action, climbing a tree to enter the room through the window. Meanwhile, Cinderella, the acrobat, swung from the roof to rescue Mrs. Renauld. In the end, Marthe Daubreuil was unmasked as the murderer of Mr. Renauld and the would-be murderer of Mrs. Renauld. The night's events left me bewildered and exhausted, with Poirot unraveling the intricate web of motives and lies.",1
"“I must say, that looks like hair,” I observed with a grimace. “It is indeed hair. A toupee, I presume,” “Exactly,” I responded. “Does this finally convince you that Mrs. Pettigrew is actually a man in disguise?” “Absolutely, Pagett. Those feet of hers were a dead giveaway.” “Well then, it’s settled. Now, Sir Eustace, I need to discuss some personal matters with you. Your subtle hints about my time in Florence have not gone unnoticed.” Finally, the truth about Pagett's time in Florence is about to come to light. “Just come clean, my friend,” I urged gently.",1
"I reached out with a trembling hand, my heart racing as I grasped it. The weight was unexpected, sending a jolt of excitement through me. Carefully, I removed the adhesive plaster sealing it shut. As I lifted the lid, a cascade of dull glassy pebbles spilled out onto the surface. ""Pebbles,"" I muttered, my disappointment palpable. ""Pebbles?"" Suzanne exclaimed, her voice filled with disbelief. ""Not pebbles, Anne! Diamonds!"" Diamonds! The word echoed in my mind as I gazed at the glimmering heap before me. Each stone appeared unassuming, like a shard of glass. ""Are you certain, Suzanne?"" I inquired. ""Absolutely, my dear.""",1
"I awoke from troubled dreams once more, desperate to find Harry Rayburn and warn him of some unknown danger. As I regained consciousness, memories of the nightmarish ordeal flooded back to me - the hurried escape from the hotel, the mysterious figure in the shadows, and the terrifying sensation of falling. Miraculously, I had survived the ordeal, though I was battered and weak. As I struggled to move, I realized I was confined in a cramped room with walls made of rough wood.",1

Poirot also convinced Mrs. Renauld to disclose her secret to Jack, revealing his father's dark past as a fugitive. Poirot ensured that the truth remained hidden from the world, sparing Jack and his family from shame. Jack later decided to start a new life in South America, accompanied by his mother. Poirot encouraged Jack to seek out his love and face the future with honesty and courage. In the end, Poirot and Hastings shared a moment of lighthearted observation in the garden.",1
"""I am quite famished,"" she whispered. ""Excellent. You're at the purser's table, correct? Confront him about the cabin."" Making my way to the saloon, I started to eat cautiously and ended up devouring a massive meal. My acquaintance from the day before commended me on my improved appetite. He informed me that everyone was changing cabins that day and assured me that my belongings would be transferred to an exterior one promptly. Our table consisted of only four individuals: myself, two older women, and a zealous missionary who frequently discussed ""our impoverished black brethren.""",1
"Born in England, he had traveled extensively around the globe. From hunting big game in Africa to living on a ranch in California, he had also conducted business in the South Sea Islands. Serving as a secretary to a prominent railway tycoon in New York, he even spent time with a hospitable Arab tribe in the desert. With precision, he identified M. Hautet. ""Are you the investigating judge on this case? A pleasure to make your acquaintance, M. le juge. This situation is truly distressing. How is Mrs. Renauld holding up? Is she managing to cope with the ordeal? It must have been a tremendous shock for her.""",1
"Flemming and her friends appeared to be incredibly mundane to me. Their conversations revolved around themselves, their children, and the struggles of procuring quality milk for their little ones. They would then transition to discussing the challenges of finding reliable servants, recounting their interactions with the staff at the Registry Office. It was rare to see them engage with current events or show any interest in the world beyond their comfort zone. They harbored a distaste for travel, finding everything abroad too unfamiliar compared to their beloved England.",1

Madame Beroldy's manipulative nature and hidden motives were finally exposed, revealing a dark and twisted tale of betrayal and revenge. The case was a tangled web of secrets and lies, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. The shocking revelation of Madame Beroldy's true intentions left everyone stunned, proving that sometimes the most innocent-looking faces hide the darkest hearts.",1
"M. Hautet bid us farewell, laughing heartily and enchanted with himself. Poirot, on the other hand, called him an old imbecile, showing his disdain. Just as we were leaving the building, we ran into Giraud, looking pleased with himself. Poirot hinted that the end of the case was near, but Giraud was dismissive. Poirot then challenged Giraud to a bet, claiming he would find the real murderer before him. Despite Giraud's initial reluctance, he finally agreed. As we walked, Poirot's determination was evident, causing me to doubt my ability to protect Bella. Suddenly, Gabriel Stonor joined us, expressing his belief in Jack Renauld's innocence. Stonor's words gave me hope in the midst of uncertainty.",1
"“You confided in me during our train ride back from Paris about your Italian heritage and a past incident involving it. There was mention of a threatening letter sent to Jack Renauld. Upon encountering him, a surge of anger and jealousy overwhelmed you, leading to a fatal act.

I understand now, it’s all clear.” Abruptly, she fixed me with a fierce gaze.",1
"“Good gracious, we’ve certainly surprised the poor man!” she exclaimed to an invisible crowd. “I beg your pardon for my outburst! Quite improper, I know, but my goodness, the circumstances warrant it! Can you believe I’ve misplaced my sole sibling?”“Is that so?” I responded courteously. “What a dreadful situation.”“He is disapproving!” the woman declared. “He wholeheartedly disapproves of me, and my sister, which is unjust, considering he has yet to meet her!” I started to speak, but she cut me off.“Enough said! No one cares for me! I shall retire to the orchard and devour earthworms! Oh woe is me! I am devastated!” With that, she disappeared behind a large, whimsical Italian magazine.",1
"""Poirot agreed to join Lady Yardly and the children, quickly forming a bond with them. They played together and even managed to pull me into the fun. “You are a good mother,” Poirot complimented Lady Yardly, as the children were taken away by their nurse.

She sought the help of Monsieur Poirot, who surprisingly admitted to believing in superstition. Poirot assured her that he would protect her son from harm, both physical and occult. Lady Willard mentioned the members of the expedition, including her husband's nephew, who had recently committed suicide in New York. Poirot decided to investigate further and they set off for Egypt the next day, despite Poirot's dread of the sea. Now, beneath the scorching sun of the desert, Poirot's discomfort was evident as they approached the Pyramids.",1
"""On the contrary,"" Suzanne declared firmly, ""let's shift our focus to something more captivating. Anne, let's discuss those diamonds."" ""What concerns you about them?"" ""I'm beginning to doubt their safety in my possession. It was fine before, no one would suspect they were among my belongings. But now that everyone is aware of our close friendship, you and I, I fear I'll be under scrutiny as well."" ""But no one knows they're concealed in a roll of film,"" I countered. ""It's a clever hiding spot and I don't believe we could find a better one."" She reluctantly agreed, suggesting we revisit the topic once we reached the Falls. Our departure was scheduled for nine o'clock. Sir Eustace's mood remained sour, while Miss Pettigrew appeared subdued. Colonel Race seemed unaffected. The previous conversation felt like a distant memory to me. I drifted into a deep sleep that night on my uncomfortable bunk, battling with vague, threatening dreams. I woke up with a headache and stepped out onto the observation deck of the carriage. The air was crisp and delightful, with rolling wooded hills stretching as far as the eye could see. I was enamored with the scenery, more so than any other place I had ever encountered. In that moment, I longed for a tiny hut nestled in the heart of the wilderness, a place to call my own forever. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race summoned me from the ""office"" and gestured towards a bouquet-shaped white mist hovering over a portion of the bush. ""That's the spray from the Falls,"" he remarked. ""We're almost there."" I was still enveloped in a peculiar sense of euphoria that followed my restless night. It felt as though I had returned home, despite never having been there before - or had I, in my dreams? We disembarked from the train and made our way to the hotel, a large white structure protected by mosquito wire. There were no roads or houses in sight. As we stepped onto the stoep, I let out a gasp. Half a mile in the distance, facing us, were the majestic Falls. I had never witnessed such grandeur and beauty, and I knew I never would again. ""Anne, you seem otherworldly,"" Suzanne remarked as we sat down for lunch. ""You're different today."" She studied me intently. ""Am I?"" I chuckled, though my laughter felt forced. ""I just adore it all."" ""It's more than that."" A look of concern crossed her face. Yes, I was content, but beyond that, I had a sense of anticipation, a feeling that something was about to transpire. I was on edge, restless. After tea, we took a leisurely stroll, boarded the trolley, and were pushed by cheerful locals along the rail tracks to the bridge. The sight was breathtaking - the immense chasm, the rapid waters below, and the veil of mist and spray that intermittently revealed the cascade before enveloping it once more in mystery. That, to me, was the allure of the Falls - their elusive nature. You always anticipate a sight, yet it remains just out of reach. We crossed the bridge and followed the path outlined with white stones, skirting the edge of the gorge.",1
"""Upon Poirot's crest-fallen expression, the magistrate called for Marchaud. 'Please convey my regards to Madame Renauld,' he said, 'and ask if she would spare a few moments to speak with me. Let her know not to trouble herself; I will come up to her.' Marchaud saluted and left. We lingered in anticipation until, unexpectedly, the door swung open and Mrs. Renauld, ashen in her mourning attire, appeared. M. Hautet hastily offered her a chair, expressing his concern, to which she responded with a grateful smile. Stonor, overcome with emotion, clasped one of her hands in his, unable to find the right words.""",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, the inhabitants fast asleep. As we stood below Mrs. Renauld’s open window, a cry for help pierced the night. Poirot sprang into action, rushing to the front door, then scaling a tree with feline grace to enter through the window. The scene inside was chaotic, with Mrs. Renauld barely clinging to life. The true culprit, Marthe Daubreuil, lay dead on the ground, a victim of her own twisted plot. The events of that night unfolded like a macabre dance, revealing a web of deceit and greed that only Poirot could untangle.",1
"""The check was made out to a certain Duveen,"" Poirot pointed out. ""I suspect it was the former,"" he continued, ""considering the resemblance to M. Renauld's handwriting."" The authenticity was quickly confirmed by cross-referencing it with a note found on the desk. The commissary, looking sheepish, muttered, ""I can't believe I missed this."" Poirot chuckled. ""Always check under the mats! My associate Hastings knows that any irregularity bothers me. When I noticed the rug askew, I immediately thought, 'Ah! The chair leg must have nudged it.'""",1
""" He scrutinized me intently for a few minutes. ""Yes. I understand perfectly. And you are wise. Stick to your story."" ""That seems to be your constant advice,"" I said, slightly annoyed. ""Ah, my friend, trust in Papa Poirot. One day, with your permission, I will arrange a suitable marriage for you."" ""Thank you,"" I replied with a laugh, ""but the idea doesn't appeal to me."" Poirot sighed and shook his head. ""The English!"" he muttered. ""No method at all. They leave everything to chance!"" He scowled and adjusted the position of the salt shaker. ""You mentioned that Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel du Phare, didn't you?"" ""No. Hôtel du Phare."" ""Right, I forgot."" A moment of doubt crossed my mind. Had I ever told Poirot about the hotel? I glanced at him and felt reassured. He was meticulously cutting his bread into small squares, completely engrossed in the task. He must have assumed I had informed him of the girl's whereabouts. We had coffee outside overlooking the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, then checked his watch. ""The train to Paris departs at 2:25,"" he noted. ""I should be on my way."" ""Paris?"" I exclaimed. ""That's correct, my friend."" ""You're going to Paris? But why?"" He responded gravely. ""To find the killer of Mr. Renauld."" ""You think he's in Paris?"" ""I'm certain he isn't. However, that's where I must search for him. You may not comprehend, but I'll elucidate in due time. Trust me, this trip to Paris is essential. I won't be gone long. Most likely, I'll return tomorrow. I don't suggest you accompany me. Stay here, keep an eye on Giraud. Also, befriend Mr. Renauld's son. And if you wish, try to woo Mademoiselle Marthe. But I doubt you'll succeed."" I wasn't pleased with his final comment. ""That reminds me,"" I said. ""I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?"" ""My friend, I understand human nature. Put together a young boy Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the outcome is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was either money or a woman, and recalling Léonie's account of the lad's anger, I opted for the latter. So I made my deduction, and I was correct."" ""And that's why you cautioned me against pursuing the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?"" Poirot smiled. ""At the very least, I noticed she had worried eyes. That is how I always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes."" His tone was so serious that it unsettled me. ""What do you mean by that, Poirot?"" ""I believe, my friend, that we will find out soon enough. But I must depart."" ""You have plenty of time."" ""Perhaps, perhaps. But I prefer to have leisure at the station. I don't want to rush or hurry or agitate myself."" ""In any case,"" I said, getting up, ""I'll come and see you off."" ""You will do no such thing. I forbid it."" He was so authoritative that I stared at him in astonishment. He nodded emphatically. ""I mean it, my friend. Goodbye! May I shake your hand? Oh no, I forgot it's not the English custom. A handshake, then."" I felt somewhat lost after Poirot had left. I walked along the beach, observing the swimmers, without feeling motivated enough to join them. I half expected Cinderella to be frolicking among them in some extravagant outfit, but I saw no sign of her. I wandered aimlessly along the shore towards the far end of town. It occurred to me that it would be only proper to inquire about the girl. And it would save trouble in the long run. The issue would then be resolved. I wouldn't have to worry about her any longer. But if I didn't go at all, she might come looking for me at the Villa. And that would be inconvenient in every way. Definitely, it would be better to make a brief visit, during which I could make it clear that I could offer no further assistance to her as a guide. So I left the beach and headed inland. I quickly located the Hôtel du Phare, a very modest building. It was extremely frustrating not to know the lady's name, and to preserve my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I would find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small town, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino under construction, but it was not yet finished. I had walked the length of the beach without spotting her, so she must be in the hotel. I entered. Several people were seated in the tiny lounge, but my target was not among them. I peeked into a few other rooms, but she was nowhere to be found. I waited for a while, until my impatience got the best of me. I pulled the concierge aside and slipped five francs into his hand. ""I want to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, petite and dark. I'm not certain of her name."" The man shook his head, trying to suppress a smirk. ""There is no lady here matching your description."" ""Perhaps she's American,"" I suggested. These people are so dense. But the man continued to shake his head. ""No, sir. There are only six or seven English and American ladies in total, and they are all much older than the lady you're seeking. You won't find her here, sir."" He was so adamant that I began to doubt myself. ""But the lady informed me she was staying here."" ""You or the lady must have made an error, as another gentleman has been here asking about her."" ""What did he look like?"" ""He was a small, well-dressed gentleman, very tidy, with a very stiff mustache, a peculiarly shaped head, and green eyes."" Poirot! So that's why he didn't want me to accompany him to the station.""",1
"When I considered it, did anyone ever bother to include the year when writing a date? If 17 was code for Cabin 17, then what about 1? Perhaps one o'clock. In that case, 22 must be the date. Glancing at my pocket almanac, I saw that tomorrow was indeed the 22nd. My excitement grew. It seemed I had finally uncovered the correct path. One thing was certain - I could not leave the cabin. The stench of asafœtida had to be endured. Reviewing my clues once more, I deduced that something was set to occur on the 22nd at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. I leaned towards 1 a.m. It was currently seven o'clock. In six hours, the truth would be revealed. The following hours were a blur.",1
"I struck up a conversation with Mr. Chichester, hoping to glean some information. He mentioned his time in Africa, but I couldn't help but notice his lack of sunburn. As he fumbled with a piece of paper, claiming it was part of a sermon, my suspicions grew. Later, during a conversation about Italy, Mr. Pagett seemed uneasy and quickly excused himself. Sir Eustace joked about his secretary possibly committing a dark deed in Florence. Despite his respectable appearance, the idea lingered in the air. As the group dispersed, Mr. Chichester's clumsy action caught my attention once again. Colonel Race then approached me, commenting on my elusive nature at the previous night's dance. We discussed plans for the evening, hinting at a dance together.",1
"“Poirot was about to continue when the door burst open, revealing a magnificent figure. With his impeccably styled black hair and polished boots, Gregory Rolf entered the room exuding an air of heroism. ""I promised to stop by, Mary,"" he announced. ""So here I am. What's Poirot's take on our little predicament? Thinks it's all a hoax, like me?"" Poirot gazed up at the imposing actor, the two of them an odd pair. ""Whether hoax or not, Mr. Rolf,"" he remarked wryly, ""I've advised your wife against bringing the jewel to Yardly Chase on Friday."" ""Couldn't agree more, sir.”",1
"A dreadful act, undoubtedly, and I must admit to feeling a tinge of guilt in disclosing this to you, but the trials of finding a suitable apartment are well known."" I reassured her that I was fully cognizant of how the quest for living space often brings out the worst in people, and that the ruthless law of survival of the fittest always held true. ""And so we ascended, and can you imagine, the apartment was still available. The maid gave us a tour, we met the landlady, and the deal was struck on the spot. Immediate occupancy and fifty pounds for the furnishings. The contract was signed the following day, and we are scheduled to move in tomorrow!"" Mrs. Robinson concluded with a note of triumph.",1
"Then, as he approached the bedside, 'Fear not, Eloise,' he whispered. 'I will be back by morning.' Despite his attempt at reassurance, fear lingered in his gaze. They quickly escorted him out, the tall figure warning, 'A single noise and you're a dead man.' ""Following that,"" Mrs. Renauld recounted, ""I must have lost consciousness. The next memory I have is of Léonie massaging my hands and offering me brandy."" ""Madame Renauld,"" inquired the judge, ""did you have any inkling of what the intruders were seeking?"" ""None at all, sir."" ""Were you aware of any apprehensions your husband harbored?"" ""Indeed. I witnessed the transformation in him.""",1
"“I had to come clean, Anne. When I started to suspect Colonel Race, I was in a panic about the diamonds. I stayed at the Falls thinking he might have taken you nearby, but I didn’t know what to do with the diamonds. I was too scared to hold onto them,” Suzanne glanced around nervously, then whispered urgently in my ear. “A very wise decision,” I agreed. “At the time, anyway. It’s a bit tricky now. What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?” “The large ones were sent to Cape Town. Pagett informed me before I left the Falls, enclosing the storage receipt. He’s leaving Cape Town today to meet Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I understand,” I mused. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I assume Sir Eustace has them with him.” I pondered the situation. “Well,” I said finally, “it’s inconvenient but it’s safe. Let’s not act for now.” Suzanne gave me a smile. “You don’t like sitting idle, do you, Anne?” “Not really,” I replied truthfully. The only thing I could do was check the train schedule to see when Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I discovered it was due at 5.40 the next afternoon and would depart at 6. I wanted to meet Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed like a good opportunity. The situation in the Rand was becoming dire, and another chance might not come soon. The only thing that brightened my day was a message from Johannesburg. An innocent telegram: “Arrived safely. All is well. Eric is here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Stay put for now. Andy.” Eric was our code name for Race. I chose it because I detest that name. There was nothing to be done until I could meet Pagett. Suzanne occupied herself by sending a comforting cable to Clarence in the distance. She became sentimental about him. In her own way, very different from me and Harry, she genuinely cared for Clarence. “I wish he was here, Anne,” she sobbed. “It’s been so long since I saw him.” “Have some face cream,” I offered soothingly. Suzanne dabbed a bit on her nose. “I’ll need more face cream soon,” she noted, “and you can only find this kind in Paris.” She sighed. “Paris!” “Suzanne,” I said, “you’ll soon have your fill of South Africa and adventure.” “I’d love a really nice hat,” Suzanne admitted longingly. “Should I accompany you to meet Guy Pagett tomorrow?” “I’d rather go alone. He’d be more comfortable speaking in front of just one of us.” And so, the next afternoon, I stood at the hotel entrance, struggling with a stubborn parasol that refused to open, while Suzanne relaxed on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit. According to the hotel porter, the train was surprisingly punctual today, though he doubted it would make it through to Johannesburg. The line had been sabotaged, he gravely informed me. It sounded promising! The train arrived just ten minutes behind schedule. Everyone poured out onto the platform, walking back and forth anxiously. I easily spotted Pagett. I approached him eagerly. He jumped at the sight of me, more than usual this time. “My word, Miss Beddingfeld, I thought you had vanished.” “I’ve reappeared,” I informed him solemnly. “How are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Fine, thank you looking forward to resuming my duties with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I said, “there’s something I need to ask you. I hope you won’t be offended, but it’s crucial. I want to know what you were doing in Marlow on January 8th last year?” He started. “Really, Miss Beddingfeld I indeed” “You were there, weren’t you?” “I had my reasons I was in the vicinity, yes.” “Can you tell me what those reasons were?” “Hasn’t Sir Eustace already informed you?” “Sir Eustace? Does he know?” “I’m fairly certain he does. I hoped he hadn’t recognized me, but from his insinuations and comments, I fear it’s quite likely. In any case, I intended to come clean and offer him my resignation. He’s an unusual man, Miss Beddingfeld, with a strange sense of humor. It amuses him to keep me in suspense. I suspect he knew the truth all along. Perhaps he’s known for years.” I hoped to decipher Pagett’s ramblings eventually. He continued confidently: “It’s hard for a man of Sir Eustace’s stature to understand my position. I admit my mistake, but it seemed harmless. I think he should have confronted me directly instead of making sly jokes at my expense.” A whistle blew, and people started boarding the train. “Yes, Mr. Pagett,” I interjected, “I agree with your views on Sir Eustace. But why did you visit Marlow?” “It was a lapse in judgment, but understandable given the circumstances yes, I still believe understandable given the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I exclaimed in frustration. Pagett seemed to realize I had asked a question. His focus shifted from Sir Eustace and himself to me. “I apologize, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I don’t see why you’re interested in this.” He was back on the train, leaning down to speak to me. I felt at a loss. What to do with a man like him? “If it’s so dreadful that you can’t tell me” I began snidely. Finally, I struck a nerve. Pagett stiffened and blushed. “Dreadful? Ashamed? I don’t understand.” “Then enlighten me.” In three brief sentences, he spilled the beans. At last, Pagett’s secret was out! It was nothing like I had anticipated. I made my way back to the hotel slowly. A telegram was handed to me. I tore it open. It contained clear instructions for me to head straight to Johannesburg, or rather to a station just outside Johannesburg, where I would be met by a car. It was signed not Andy, but Harry. I settled into a chair for some serious contemplation.",1
"I returned from France with her that day, and said goodbye to her at Victoria that evening making it impossible for her to be in Merlinville.” Poirot gave me a thoughtful look. “Would you swear to that in a court of law?” “Absolutely,” I replied. Poirot stood up and nodded. “My friend! Love conquers all! Your plan is quite clever. It even outsmarts Hercule Poirot!” After a period of tension, as I have just described, there is always a moment of relief. I went to bed that night feeling victorious, only to wake up realizing that I was not yet in the clear. Although, I couldn't find any flaws in the alibi I had come up with so suddenly.",1
"""Feel free to tell the story in your own words,"" I encouraged, as he continued: ""Arriving in Kimberley, we were filled with pride over our discovery. Carrying a valuable collection of diamonds, we sought the opinion of experts. It was at the Kimberley hotel where we encountered her."" My body tensed slightly, my hand gripping the doorpost unconsciously. ""Anita Grünberg, an actress. Youthful and strikingly beautiful. Though born in South Africa, her mother hailed from Hungary. There was an air of mystery surrounding her, adding to her allure for two young men fresh from the wilderness. It seems she had no trouble at all.""",1
"""We will go to meet Sir Guy Willard. He was eager to know when you would arrive,"" Dr. Tosswill informed us. Leading us through the camp, we reached a spacious tent. Dr. Tosswill opened the flap and we stepped inside. Three men were seated there. ""Sir Guy, Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings are here,"" announced Dr. Tosswill. The youngest man among them stood up excitedly and approached us, bearing a resemblance to his mother in his impulsive demeanor.",1
"""Furthermore, the fact that he openly pawned the ring suggests that murder was not his motive. Additionally, a sneak-thief is typically not a killer. Moreover, since he has been incarcerated since Saturday, it would be too coincidental for him to provide such a detailed description of Lowen."" Japp agreed with a nod. ""I'm not saying you're wrong. However, convincing a jury to consider a jailbird's testimony will be a challenge. What baffles me is why Lowen didn't come up with a more clever plan to get rid of the ring."" Poirot simply shrugged.",1
"I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it. It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: "". 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any importance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure. Moth balls again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt strongly of them. But, then I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking. I explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea. After that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry out a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was watching the doctor examine the body. First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had got what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls. There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident. That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and when Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me. “Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest. You say no one else was near enough to see what happened?” “I had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can’t be sure and, anyway, they wouldn’t be as near as I was.” The inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure. The deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been found in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel. The bureau clerk from the hotel identified the man as having arrived the day before and booked a room under that name. He had registered as L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He had evidently come straight off the steamer. I was the only person who had seen anything of the affair. “You think it was an accident?” the coroner asked me. “I am positive of it. Something alarmed him, and he stepped backwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.” “But what could have alarmed him?” “That I don’t know. But there was something. He looked panic-stricken.” A stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats. The man might have seen a cat. I didn’t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide. “It is extraordinary to me,” said the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward. His name and address should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular not to do so.” I smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor. In pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard at an early date. But the next morning brought a surprise. The Flemmings took in the Daily Budget, and the Daily Budget was having a day after its own heart. EXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT. WOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. In an upper room of the Mill House the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday, strangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not been identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.” Nobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited the following facts. Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and her address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body. Mrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler’s gardener, who acted as caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge opening on the main road, gave evidence. About three o’clock that afternoon, a lady came to see over the house. She produced an order from the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James gave her the keys of the house. It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit.",1
"In the hallway, Giraud stood facing his captive. ""Good afternoon, M. Giraud,"" Poirot greeted. Giraud pointed towards Jack. ""He tried to escape, but I caught him. He's being held for his father's murder."" Poirot turned to Jack, who stood against the wall, pale and silent. ""What do you have to say for yourself?"" Jack remained silent. I was shocked. I had hoped for a denial, but Jack's silence was damning. Poirot questioned Giraud's reasons for the arrest. As they entered the salon, Giraud boasted about his detective skills. Poirot listened attentively, then pointed out a flaw in Giraud's theory. Intrigued, I followed Poirot out of the room. As they emerged, Mrs. Renauld appeared on the stairs, shocked to see her son in custody.",1
"“Perhaps it has been here for quite some time. However, it holds no interest for me.” “On the contrary, I find it quite intriguing,” Poirot replied with a touch of sweetness. I suspected he was simply trying to provoke the Paris detective, and if that was his goal, he certainly achieved it. The other man turned away abruptly, stating that he was not willing to waste any more time. He then bent down to continue his thorough search of the area. Meanwhile, Poirot, as if struck by a sudden inspiration, stepped back across the boundary and tested the door of the small shed. “It's locked,” Giraud remarked without looking. “But it's only where the gardener stores his junk.”",1
"I asked her, ""Don't you think this is sufficient? It's going to be quite horrifying and distasteful."" There was a strange expression on her face that I struggled to understand. Suddenly, she burst into laughter. ""I have a taste for the macabre,"" she declared. ""Let's go."" We made our way to the shed in complete silence. As I opened the door, we stepped inside. Approaching the body, I delicately uncovered it just as M. Bex had shown me the day before. A soft gasp escaped from the girl's lips, causing me to glance in her direction.",1
"I noticed it as we ascended the staircase of the tall building in a serene Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me with a friendly demeanor. She appeared to be a sturdy, calm woman of the ""ideal wife and mother"" category. Showing me to a pristine bedroom adorned with chintz, she assured me that tea would be served shortly and then departed, leaving me alone. Her voice, slightly elevated, drifted from the drawing-room below on the first level. ""Well, Henry, what in the world"" I couldn't make out the rest, but the sharpness of the tone was unmistakable.",1
"""That appeared to rattle him quite a bit, and he mentioned that having a wife was extremely beneficial for a General Practitioner. The notion seemed even less romantic than previously, however there was a part of me that leaned towards agreeing to it. Security, that was what was being offered to me. Security and a Cozy Residence. Reflecting on it now, I think I misjudged the little man. He truly loved me, but a misguided sense of propriety held him back from pursuing me in that way. Nevertheless, my affection for adventure resisted. ""It's incredibly generous of you,"" I responded. ""But it's not feasible. I could never wed a man unless I was passionately in love with him.""",1
"The month was June, with daylight still lingering at eight o’clock but fading by half-past. Does that ring a bell? I sense a vague inkling that you will come around eventually. Moving on, the coffee was incredibly dark, in stark contrast to Count Foscatini’s gleaming white teeth. Coffee tends to stain teeth, leading us to deduce that Count Foscatini abstained from it. However, all three cups contained coffee. So, why would someone fabricate the notion that Count Foscatini had imbibed coffee when he hadn’t? Perplexed, I shook my head, seeking clarity. ""Let me assist you,"" he said.",1
"We were both immediately captivated by her, and the news hit us both like a ton of bricks. Surprisingly, it didn't strain our friendship in the least. In fact, we were both prepared to step back and let the other pursue her. However, that wasn't her intention. Looking back, I couldn't help but wonder why she didn't go for it, considering Sir Laurence Eardsley's son was quite the catch. As it turns out, she was secretly married to a De Beers' employee, a detail that had escaped everyone's notice.",1
"She made it clear to me that Sir Eustace lived his life with a strong focus on feeling secure and at ease. His self-preservation instinct was sharp. The death of Nadina removed some of his inhibitions. His actions were driven by his intense fears for his own safety, rather than his feelings towards me. I believe Suzanne is correct. As for Nadina, she was the type of woman who brought death upon herself. While men may resort to questionable means to become wealthy, women should not feign love for hidden agendas. I can pardon Sir Eustace quite easily, but I will never be able to forgive Nadina.",1
"I would have been more content if I could have laid him to rest in a cave adorned with ancient art and tools, but the community's expectations led to a tidy grave (complete with marble slab) in the unattractive local churchyard. The vicar's attempts to offer solace fell short. It was only after some time that I grasped the reality that the independence I had always yearned for was now mine. Despite being an orphan with little money, I was finally free. Simultaneously, I recognized the remarkable compassion of these generous individuals. The vicar made a strong appeal for me to assist his wife who was in immediate need of a companion.",1
"""There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings."" The note was hastily scrawled, the words almost illegible: ""Dear M. Poirot: ""Please, I beg you to come to our aid. Jack must be saved at all costs. I have no one else to turn to. Please help us. ""MARTHE DAUBREUIL."" I returned the note, touched by the urgency. ""Will you go?"" ""Immediately. We'll arrange for a car."" Within thirty minutes, we arrived at Villa Marguerite. Marthe welcomed us at the door, her hands tightly gripping Poirot's. ""I'm so grateful you've come. I've been desperate, not knowing what to do. They won't let me visit him in prison. I'm in agony, nearly losing my mind. Is it true that he's not denying the crime? But that's impossible. He couldn't have done it! I refuse to believe it for a moment."" ""I don't believe it either, mademoiselle,"" Poirot reassured her gently. ""Then why won't he speak? I don't understand,"" Marthe questioned. ""Maybe he's protecting someone,"" Poirot suggested, observing her closely. Marthe's brow furrowed. ""Protecting someone? Do you mean his mother? I've suspected her from the start. Who stands to inherit the vast fortune? She does. It's easy to play the grieving widow. And when he was arrested, she fainted dramatically. And that secretary, M. Stonor, he's in cahoots with her. They're as thick as thieves. She may be older, but what do men care if a woman is wealthy?"" Her tone held a bitter edge. ""Stonor claimed he was in England,"" I interjected. ""He says so, but who can be sure?"" ""Mademoiselle,"" Poirot interjected calmly, ""if we're to solve this, we need clarity. I have a question for you."" ""Yes, monsieur?"" Marthe replied. ""Do you know your mother's true identity?"" Poirot inquired. Marthe hesitated for a moment, then buried her head in her arms, tears streaming down her face. ""There, there,"" Poirot comforted her, patting her shoulder. ""Calm down, petite. I see that you do. Now, another question. Did you know who M. Renauld really was?"" ""M. Renauld,"" Marthe lifted her head, puzzled. ""Ah, I see you didn't know that. Listen carefully,"" Poirot began to explain the intricacies of the case, capturing Marthe's full attention. After he finished, she took a deep breath. ""You're brilliant, magnificent! You're the world's greatest detective."" With a quick movement, she got off her chair and knelt before him, a gesture of complete surrender. ""Save him, monsieur,"" she implored. ""I love him so much. Please, save him, save him, save him!"" The next morning, we were present at Jack Renauld's interrogation. In a short span of time, I noticed a drastic change in the young prisoner. His appearance had deteriorated, with sunken cheeks, dark circles under his eyes, and a look of exhaustion, as if sleep had eluded him for several nights. He showed no emotion upon seeing us. Jack and his lawyer, Maître Grosíer, were seated, a guard stood watchfully by the door, and the court clerk sat at his desk. The questioning commenced. ""Renauld,"" the magistrate began, ""do you deny being in Merlinville on the night of the crime?"" Jack hesitated before replying, his manner hesitant: ""I I told you I was in Cherbourg."" Maître Grosíer sighed, realizing that Jack was determined to handle his case his way, much to the lawyer's dismay. The magistrate turned sharply. ""Bring in the station witnesses."" Shortly, a porter from Merlinville station entered, and the interrogation continued.",1
"""I must admit, I can no longer hide the truth. You appear to be quite knowledgeable.” “I have utilized my intellect to my advantage. Let me be direct, Signor Ascanio, you paid a visit to the deceased on Tuesday morning, correct?” “Indeed; however, I did not return the next evening. It was unnecessary. Allow me to explain. This villain had obtained sensitive information about a prominent figure in Italy. He demanded a hefty sum for the documents. I traveled to England to settle the issue. I met with him as scheduled that morning. A young secretary from the Embassy accompanied me.""",1
"I made my way to my cabin earlier than usual. The stewardess was informed that I was fighting a cold and was not bothered by any odors. Despite her concern, I stood my ground. The night dragged on endlessly. Eventually, I retired to bed, but not without preparing for the worst. I wrapped myself in a heavy dressing gown and slipped on my warm slippers. Fully dressed for action, I was ready to react to any unforeseen events. What exactly was I anticipating? The possibilities were unclear, a jumble of far-fetched scenarios raced through my mind.",1
"""But was it Daniels or O’Murphy behind it all? One of them had to be involved, considering the car veered off the main road. It seems highly unlikely that the Prime Minister would be complicit in his own demise! Did O’Murphy make that fateful turn on his own, or was Daniels the mastermind behind it all?” “It appears more likely that O’Murphy was the culprit.” “Certainly, because if it had been Daniels, the Prime Minister would have overheard the command and inquired about the motive. Yet, there seems to be an abundance of unanswered questions in this case, each one contradicting the next.""",1
"Descending the steps, supported by Léonie, Mrs. Renauld appeared, her head wrapped in bandages. The French girl was in tears, begging her mistress to go back to bed. “Madame, you will harm yourself. This goes against the doctor's orders!” Mrs. Renauld continued on. “Mother,” Jack called out, moving towards her. But she pushed him away. “I am not your mother! You are not my son! I disown you from this moment on.” “Mother,” Jack said, shocked. She hesitated, seeming to falter at his pain. Poirot tried to intervene, but she quickly regained her composure. “Your father's death is on your hands. You are to blame for defying him over this girl, and for causing his death with your heartless treatment of another girl. Leave my house. Tomorrow, I will ensure you never see a penny of his money. Make your own way in the world with the daughter of your father's enemy!” Slowly, she made her way back upstairs. We were all speechless, caught off guard by her outburst. Jack, exhausted from everything he had been through, swayed and almost fell. Poirot and I rushed to help him. “He is exhausted,” Poirot whispered to Marthe. “Where can we take him?” “Home! To Villa Marguerite. My mother and I will take care of him. My poor Jack!” We brought him to the Villa, where he sat down heavily in a dazed state. Poirot checked his temperature. “He has a fever. The stress is taking its toll. And now this shock. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will find a doctor.” A doctor was called and after examining Jack, he diagnosed him with nerve strain. With rest and quiet, he might recover by the next day, but excitement could lead to brain fever. Someone should stay up with him all night. We left him in Marthe and her mother's care and headed towards town. It was late and we were hungry. We found a restaurant and satisfied our hunger with an omelette and entrecôte. “Now, for a place to stay the night,” Poirot said after finishing our meal. We went to Hôtel des Bains, where we got two rooms with a sea view. Poirot surprised me by asking about Miss Robinson. She was in the salon. Poirot explained that he had arranged a marriage for me. Cinderella greeted us, and I understood Poirot's plan. He asked her if she had done as instructed and she handed him an object wrapped in paper. It was the dagger she had thrown into the sea. “Well done,” Poirot said. “You can rest now. Hastings and I have work to do. You will see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” Cinderella asked, determined to come along. Poirot agreed and we set off, heading out of town towards Villa Geneviève. But we paused at Villa Marguerite to check on Jack Renauld. Madame Daubreuil let us in and led us to his room. Jack was asleep, restless with flushed cheeks. We left quietly, with Madame Daubreuil updating us on his condition.",1
"""Pagett, my dear,"" I exclaimed, ""why must the unfortunate fellow be shadowed every time he steps on deck? Some individuals even endure the discomfort of sleeping outside. I've always found it rather unpleasant. The crew hoses down the deck, along with anyone on it, at five in the morning."" The very thought made me cringe. ""In any case,"" I added, ""if you insisted on disturbing some unfortunate soul suffering from insomnia, it's no surprise he lashed out at you."" Pagett appeared understanding. ""Allow me to explain, Sir Eustace. I was certain the man had been lurking near your cabin, where he had no legitimate reason to be.""",1
"When Pagett informed me of his affiliation with the Secret Service, a chill ran down my spine. Memories of his presence in Paris during the War, particularly his interest in Nadina, fueled my growing unease. The suspicion that he was now targeting me gnawed at my thoughts. His unwavering shadowing of my every move only heightened my concerns. Pagett embodied the archetype of the strong, silent man with a hidden agenda. As a whistle pierced the air, Sir Eustace attended to the urgent call. ""Business,"" he muttered before turning to Miss Anne to lead her to her room.",1
"""He was taken across the Channel by destroyer. Upon reaching Boulogne, he was expected to meet a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.” “But what happened?” “They set out from Boulogne, but they never made it to their destination.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a fake car and a fake A.D.C. The actual car was discovered in a side street, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. tied up and silenced.” “And the imposter vehicle?” “It's still out there.” Poirot showed signs of frustration. “Unbelievable! Surely it can't remain hidden for long?” “That's what we thought. It seemed like a matter of time before it was found. That region of France is under Military Law. We were certain that the car wouldn't go unnoticed for long. The French authorities, our own Scotland Yard officers, and the military are all putting in their best efforts. It's, as you said, unbelievable but there have been no leads!” At that moment, there was a knock at the door, and a young officer came in with a sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just arrived from France, sir. I brought it straight here, as you instructed.” The Minister eagerly tore it open and let out a cry of surprise. The officer left. “Finally, some news! This telegram has just been deciphered. They have located the second car, along with the secretary, Daniels, who was chloroformed, tied up, and silenced, in an old farm near C. He can't recall anything, except feeling something being held against his face and struggling to break free. The authorities are convinced of the truth of his statement.” “And have they found anything else?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s body? Then, there's hope. But it's strange. After attempting to shoot him this morning, why are they now going to such lengths to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing is clear. They are determined to stop him from attending the Conference at any cost.” “If it is humanely possible, the Prime Minister will be there. Let's hope it's not too late. Now, gentlemen, start from the beginning and tell me everything. I need to know about the shooting incident as well.” “Yesterday evening, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same one who went with him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they drove down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister had an appointment. Early this morning, they returned to London, and that's when the attempted assassination occurred.” “Hold on, please. Who exactly is this Captain Daniels? Do you have his background?” Lord Estair smiled. “I had a feeling you would ask that. We don't have much information on him. He doesn't come from a notable family. He has served in the British Army, and is a very capable secretary, with an impressive command over seven languages. That's why the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.” “Does he have any family in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who resides in Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives close to Ascot.” “Ascot? Isn't that near Windsor?” “That aspect has not been ignored. But it hasn't yielded any results.” “So, you consider Captain Daniels to be beyond suspicion?” A hint of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s tone as he replied: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these times, I would think twice before declaring anyone free of suspicion.” """,1
"“Two shots fired, I observe,” he noted, handing it back. “Now, madame, if I might see,” he paused delicately. “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head. The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us. “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?” She shook her head. “Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.” “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.” “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was only too right!” Tears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together. “Eh bien, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears to be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet” “Yet what?” “A slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not? Still, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own life there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood. No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and above-board but who is this?” A tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. He passed us without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking, with a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime. A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him. “Tell me, I pray you, who is that gentleman? Do you know him?” “I don’t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it. He was staying down here last week for a night. Tuesday, it was.” “Quick, mon ami, let us follow him.” We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face blanched noticeably. “You,” she gasped. “I thought you were on the sea on your way to East Africa?” “I got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the young man. “My old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money. Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel my passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do. You’ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps.” At that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped forward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction. “Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black.” A few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited the fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn. The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew. We returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee line for the Anchor Inn. “Here we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,” he explained. “You notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I meant it. But no you observed Mrs. Maltravers’ face when she caught sight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he eh bien, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here on Tuesday night the day before Mr. Maltravers died. We must investigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.” In about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn. Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged. “I have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us here,” he explained. “You can understand, monsieur le capitaine, that I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers’ state of mind immediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not wish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.” “I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure,” replied the young soldier; “but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my people’s, I didn’t know him very well myself.” “You came down when?” “Tuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock. But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.” “You were returning to East Africa, I understand?” “Yes. I’ve been out there ever since the War a great country.” “Exactly. Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?” “Oh, I don’t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I think.” “Thank you.” Poirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “With your permission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told us all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your subconscious self.” “Psychoanalysis, what?” said Black, with visible alarm. “Oh, no,” said Poirot reassuringly.",1
"""Mademoiselle, would you mind showing me once more the actions you described earlier? You were here working, correct?"" Célestine sat, stood up, went to the next room, picked up an item from the dresser, and came back. Poirot watched her closely, also keeping an eye on his bulky pocket watch. ""Could you do it one more time, please?"" After the repeat performance, he jotted something down in his notebook and put the watch away. ""Thank you, mademoiselle. And to you, sir,"" he nodded at the inspector, ""for your cooperation.""",1
"""He scrutinized me intently for a few moments. ""Indeed. I understand perfectly. And you are wise. Stick to your story,"" he said. ""That seems to be your constant advice,"" I replied, somewhat annoyed. ""Ah, my friend, trust in Papa Poirot. One day, if you allow me, I will arrange a suitable marriage for you."" ""Thank you,"" I chuckled, ""but the idea doesn't appeal to me."" Poirot sighed and shook his head. ""The English!"" he muttered. ""No method at all. They leave everything up to chance!"" He furrowed his brow and adjusted the salt cellar. ""You mentioned that Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d'Angleterre, did you not?"" ""No. Hôtel du Phare."" ""Yes, I had forgotten."" A brief moment of doubt crossed my mind. Had I ever told Poirot about the hotel? Glancing at him, I felt reassured. He was meticulously cutting his bread into small squares, completely engrossed in the task. He must have assumed I had revealed the girl's whereabouts to him. We had coffee outside, facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes and then checked his watch. ""The train to Paris departs at 2:25,"" he noted. ""I should make my way there."" ""Paris?"" I exclaimed. ""That's correct, my friend."" ""You're going to Paris? But why?"" He responded gravely. ""To find the killer of Mr. Renauld."" ""Do you think he's in Paris?"" ""I'm certain he is not. However, that is where I must search for him. You may not understand now, but I will clarify everything in due time. Trust me, this trip to Paris is essential. I won't be gone long. Most likely, I'll be back tomorrow. I don't think you should join me. Stay here, keep an eye on Giraud, and spend time with Mr. Renauld's son. And if you wish, try to win over Mademoiselle Marthe. But I doubt you'll be successful."" I wasn't particularly pleased with his last comment. ""That reminds me,"" I interjected. ""I wanted to ask you how you knew about those two?"" ""My friend, I understand human nature. Put a boy like young Renauld together with a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the outcome is almost inevitable. And then the quarrel! Money or a woman, and given Léonie's account of the boy's anger, I chose the latter. So I made my assumption, and I was right."" ""So that's why you warned me about getting involved with the lady? You already suspected she had feelings for young Renauld?"" Poirot smiled. ""At the very least, I noticed her anxious eyes. That's how I always remember Mademoiselle Daubreuil - the girl with the anxious eyes."" His tone was so serious that it unsettled me. ""What do you mean by that, Poirot?"" ""I believe, my friend, that we will find out soon enough. But I must depart."" ""You have plenty of time."" ""Perhaps, perhaps. But I prefer to have leisure at the station. I don't want to rush or hurry. At any rate,"" I said, getting up, ""I'll come see you off."" ""You will do no such thing. I forbid it."" He was so firm that I stared at him in astonishment. He nodded decisively. ""I mean it, my friend. Goodbye! May I shake your hand? Ah, no, I forgot that's not the English way. A handshake, then."" I felt somewhat lost after Poirot had left. I walked along the beach, observing the swimmers, without feeling motivated to join them. I had a hunch that Cinderella might be among them, sporting a striking outfit, but I saw no trace of her. I wandered aimlessly towards the end of town. It struck me that it would be the right thing to do to inquire about the girl. It would also save me trouble in the long run. The issue would be resolved. I wouldn't have to worry about her anymore. But if I didn't go at all, she might come looking for me at the Villa. And that would be inconvenient in every way. Clearly, it would be best to pay a brief visit, during which I could make it clear that I couldn't help her further as a showman. So I left the beach and headed inland. I soon reached the Hôtel du Phare, a modest building. It was frustrating not to know the lady's name, and to save face, I decided to step inside and have a look around. Perhaps I would find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small town - you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. A Casino was under construction, but it wasn't finished yet. Since I had walked the length of the beach without spotting her, she must be in the hotel. I entered. Several people were seated in the small lounge, but she wasn't among them. I peeked into other rooms, but she was nowhere to be seen. After waiting for a while, impatience got the better of me. I pulled the concierge aside and discreetly slipped him five francs. ""I need to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, petite and dark-haired. I'm not entirely sure of her name."" The man shook his head, attempting to stifle a grin. ""There is no lady here matching your description."" ""Perhaps she's American,"" I suggested. These people can be so dense. But the man continued to shake his head. ""No, sir. There are only six or seven English and American ladies here, and they are all older than the lady you're looking for. You won't find her here, sir."" He was quite certain, which made me doubt myself. ""But she told me she was staying here."" ""You or the lady must have made a mistake, as another gentleman was here asking for her,"" he revealed. ""What do you mean?"" I asked, taken aback. ""Yes, sir. A gentleman who described her just as you did."" ""What did he look like?"" ""He was a small, well-dressed gentleman, very tidy, with a stiff mustache, a peculiarly shaped head, and green eyes."" Poirot! So that's why he didn't want me to see him off at the station.""",1
"""The revolver at Ealing was a mistake, a clue that led me on the right track. The criminals wanted the police far from Derbyshire, so they planted it there. It wasn't the one used to shoot Mr. Pace, which Mrs. Havering did slyly. Despite Japp's efforts, they escaped justice. But fate caught up with them later. Bond robberies were on the rise, including the disappearance of a million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia. Miss Farquhar sought Poirot's help, as her fiancé was blamed for the theft. The bonds were entrusted to him by his uncle, Mr. Vavasour, and disappeared during the voyage.""",1
"Upon the recent publication of the great man's daily schedule, I had pinpointed his whereabouts. He was engrossed in dictating to his secretary in his residence. Knowing that a direct approach would be futile, I devised a clever strategy. By utilizing the Marquis of Loamsley's card, I gained access to Lord Nasby. Despite his initial outburst, I managed to present the details of the Mill House Mystery. Lord Nasby's interest was piqued, and he inquired about brachycephalic heads. Although my findings were deemed thin, I boldly requested a position on his paper to further investigate.",1

However, Hercule Poirot, with his keen eye for detail, knew that the truth was being concealed.

There was a deliberate effort to create a false narrative, but Poirot was determined to uncover the real timeline of events.""",1
"""Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and well, that’s all, I think,” I concluded lamely. “And her husband?” “Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow nothing startling.” “Dark or fair?” “I don’t know betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of face.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, there are hundreds of these average men and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.” “They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t think for an instant” Poirot raised his hand. “Tout doucement, mon ami. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see” Poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed to be amusing him vastly. “And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!” “What on earth” “And stars give light! Voilà! Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.” I accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot addressed himself: “Pardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?” The porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out: “No. 4. Second floor.” “I thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?” “Six months.” I started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirot’s malicious grin. “Impossible,” I cried. “You must be making a mistake.” “Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.” He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside. “Eh bien, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?” I did not reply. Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going. “To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.” We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests: “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?” “Yes somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think” “That you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.” The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher. The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below. “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.” I craned my neck over the staircase. “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper. “Good. Wait awhile.” About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat. “C’est ça. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.” “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily. Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift. “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us. The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.” He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly. “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously. Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring: “Not precisely to-day,” he replied. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open. “You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes though not always then and it is against that that we are going to make provision.” He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain. On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?” “Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one of your efforts of fancy.” “It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government that of Japan, for example.",1
"I had my suspicions about him, particularly his unwavering insistence on Cabin 17. Maybe it was just his stubborn nature shining through. Stubbornness can be quite the trait. It wouldn't hurt to have a chat with Mr. Chichester, I thought to myself. After a quick fix to my unruly hair, I made my way back up to the deck, determined. Luck was on my side. I spotted my target by the rail, sipping on beef tea. Stepping closer, I addressed him. ""I trust you've let go of the Cabin 17 issue,"" I ventured, flashing a smile. ""I believe holding grudges goes against the grain of true forgiveness,"" Mr. Chichester replied, his tone chilly.",1

"She had a subtle dimple in her round chin and her half parted lips held a mysterious smile. There was an exaggeratedly feminine quality about her, both yielding and seductive.

Renauld was stabbed in the back initially pointed to a crime committed by a woman."" Poirot agreed. ""Yes, the backstabbing, sure. But the grave! That took effort, it was hard work. No woman could have dug that grave, sir. That was the work of a man."" The commissary responded eagerly: ""Absolutely, you're correct.""",1
"""She entered the building, and I chatted with the lady at the front desk, acting as if I was accompanying her. Eventually, I made my way inside as well.""

I followed her into the building with vengeance on my mind, only to discover her lifeless body! I stumbled upon her in that upstairs room, it was a sight straight from hell. Lifeless, and yet I had barely missed her by mere minutes. And there was no trace of another soul in sight! I instantly grasped the dire situation I found myself in.""",1
"As he spoke, he flung the door wide and we stepped inside. The chamber M. Renauld had designated as his personal sanctuary was compact, yet adorned with exquisite elegance. A practical writing desk, complete with numerous compartments, occupied the corner by the window.

Rows of books adorned the walls, while a splendid oak sideboard with a tantalus graced the far end of the room.",1
"A large chintz-covered sofa was placed against the wall, while the window seats were adorned with the same faded chintz fabric.

After questioning the Bakers, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen to create a hidden compartment in the fireplace.

"""And, attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is equally so. So we are forced to the second that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that."" ""Yes,"" I admitted. ""It seems logical enough."" ""Bien! Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?"" ""The tramp."" ""Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?"" ""No, but "" ""Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love."" I shook my head perplexed.

""What is it, my friend?"" ""Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!"" ""Eh bien, mon ami,"" said Poirot placidly, ""that is just what he did do!"" In a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition. ""It seems strange to you, mon ami, that a man should plan his own death? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you he did not intend to die."" I shook my head, bewildered. ""But no, it is all most simple really,"" said Poirot kindly. ""For the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told you, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a different angle. ""Georges Conneau flies from justice to Canada. There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts, takes him to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the one person who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold mine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to take advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds him heavily. ""And then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the beautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That rouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father’s past, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will. How they meant to manage the body business originally, I do not know possibly an art student’s skeleton and a fire or something of the kind, but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their hands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the garden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and suddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M. Renauld calls his wife. Together they drag him into the shed as we know, the event had occurred just outside and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no resemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French type. That is sufficient. ""I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot from the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The identification must rest solely on Madame Renauld’s evidence. Jack Renauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must be got out of the way. It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters was sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon. Having heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his appeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate which, of course, it did. ""They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M. Renauld’s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to take them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame Renauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart. That night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then, taking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground where he knows a how do you call it? bunkair? is to be made. It is essential that the body should be found Madame Daubreuil must have no suspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as to identity will be greatly lessened. Then, M. Renauld will don the tramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave, unnoticed, by the 12:10 train.""",1
"As Anne Beddingfeld stood on the boat deck, the breathtaking sight of Table Mountain in the distance took her by surprise. The morning sunlight gilded the sleeping town below, casting a spell of beauty that she couldn't help but admire. The fluffy white clouds hovering above the mountain added to the magic of the moment. It was a scene that filled her with a sense of longing and wonder, a moment of pure, unadulterated romance that she had been yearning for since leaving Little Hampsly. The Kilmorden glided closer and closer, the whole experience feeling like a dream. But Anne, ever the dreamer, couldn't resist the urge to soak in every detail, to imprint the memory of this moment forever in her mind.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, everyone fast asleep. Poirot's eyes focused on the open window of Mrs. Renauld's bedroom. A cry for help pierced the silence, followed by a struggle in the room. Poirot sprang into action, trying to break down the locked door. Meanwhile, Cinderella, the acrobat, swung from the roof to save the day. The mystery unraveled as Marthe Daubreuil's lifeless body was discovered, revealing the truth behind Mr. Renauld's murder. Poirot's keen observations and deductions ultimately led to the unravelling of the complex case.",1
"``Oh, save him, save him save him!” We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us. The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient greffier sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I I told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.” “Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?” “No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we heard of the murder.” Another railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s evidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld. “These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Nothing.” M. Hautet exchanged a glance with the greffier, as the scratching of the latter’s pen recorded the answer. “Renauld,” continued the magistrate, “do you recognize this?” He took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the prisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger. “Pardon,” cried Maître Grosíer. “I demand to speak to my client before he answers that question.” But Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched Grosíer. He waved him aside, and replied quietly: “Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as a souvenir of the War.” “Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in existence?” Again Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him. “Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.” Even the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection: “Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will doubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that Madame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had taken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me ” I saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice: “I shall not contradict you. It is possible.” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back. “M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried. “Yes, but I forbid ” “My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of Mr. Renauld.” “My Friend: “You will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out with struggling. “You will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever, to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn’t for myself I did it that’s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself. “I’ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her. I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife wicked little thing! that Jack had given Bella! Ten to one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress. “I told you that I was staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but of course really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again. “Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God’s earth. I told her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing… laughing… laughing… it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once. “And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night… I was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her. So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.” “But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me. “What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the hand. Young Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated before starting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor accompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan looks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “Eh ma foi! and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle.",1
"""He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real, that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind. “Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavoring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went, told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that. I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms heavily paid for to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt. I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind. I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped. To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.” “Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here I don’t want to rub it in in any way but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?” “It does not.” Sir Eustace sighed. “A pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose. You love another, as the books say.” “I love another.” “I thought as much first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it’s the young hero who fished you out of the Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two have half the brains that I have. I’m such an easy person to underestimate.” I think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the kind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize it. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had actually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless other deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to bring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as they deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of him and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson’s Long John Silver. He must have been much the same kind of man. “Well, well,” said this extraordinary person, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn’t appeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.” I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had seemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or would they not? “The fact of the matter is,” Sir Eustace was continuing, “I’ve a weakness for you. I really don’t want to proceed to extremes. Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let’s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind I want the truth.” I was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace’s shrewdness. It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning part, but I do. You’re the kind of girl who would start off like that at a moment’s notice, on the slenderest of motives.",1
"Poirot handed back the worn English letter with a grave face. The magistrate assumed that M. Renauld was involved with an Englishwoman named Bella, leading to jealousy and threats. The case seemed simple at first, with a woman as the likely culprit due to the stabbing, but Poirot pointed out that the digging of the grave was a man's work. The masked men and the mysterious letter further complicated the investigation. The magistrate suggested looking into M. Renauld's past in Santiago for clues to his murder. Poirot agreed, praising the idea. The magistrate also mentioned involving M. Renauld's wife in the investigation and confirmed that there were no other letters from Bella among M. Renauld's belongings.",1
"""I have heard rumors,"" I began cautiously, ""that you have ties to the government, possibly even working in the Secret Service. Is there any truth to that?"" There was a brief pause, almost imperceptible, before he responded. ""Let me assure you, Miss Bedford, that I am simply a tourist enjoying my own private travels."" Reflecting on his response afterwards, I couldn't shake the feeling of ambiguity. It seemed intentional. We returned to the car in silence, making a pit stop for tea at a rustic roadside cafe on our way back to Bulawayo.",1
"""My initial plan was to spend a few days exploring the Falls, a sight I have yet to witness despite this being my third trip to Africa. Afterwards, I intended to travel to Jo’burg to analyze the state of affairs on the Rand. Back in my country, I am regarded as an expert on South African politics. However, based on what I have been told, Jo’burg will soon become a rather inhospitable destination. I have no desire to investigate the situation amidst a potential uprising."" Race responded with a condescending smile. ""I believe your concerns are unfounded, Sir Eustace.""",1
"""Dear Hastings, I am in need of a new residence and have set my sights on Montagu Mansions. There is an air of intrigue surrounding that place, mark my words."" Luckily, luck was on our side. Apartment No. 8, located on the fourth floor, was available for rent at the price of ten guineas per week. Without hesitation, Poirot secured it for a month. As we stepped back onto the bustling street, he dismissed my objections with a wave of his hand: ""I am doing well financially, my friend. Why not treat myself to a little luxury? And speaking of which, Hastings, do you happen to possess a revolver?"" ""I believe I do, somewhere,"" I replied, feeling a shiver of excitement. ""Do you anticipate"" ""Needing it? It is a distinct possibility.""",1
"I looked at Race, a sudden urge to delve deeper into his story taking hold of me. ""Who would be considered Sir Laurence's closest relative, Race? Any idea?"" His smile was knowing. ""That would be me,"" he declared. (Anne's Story Continued) The evening of the masquerade ball marked a turning point for me. I realized it was time to share my burden with someone. Until then, I had relished working alone. But now, everything was different. Doubt clouded my mind, and a sense of isolation seeped into my soul for the first time.",1
"I peered through the keyhole, expecting to hear voices. Sure enough, the big Dutchman was one of the speakers. The other man remained just out of sight. Abruptly, he stood up to pour himself a drink, revealing his back in dark clothing. Even before he faced me, I recognized him. Mr. Chichester! Gradually, I caught snippets of their conversation. ""It's risky, nonetheless. What if her companions seek retribution?"" the big man muttered. Chichester responded, abandoning his usual clergyman's tone. It was no wonder I hadn't identified him sooner.",1
"""Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and well, that’s all, I think,” I concluded lamely. “And her husband?” “Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow nothing startling.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, there are hundreds of these average men and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.” “They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t think for an instant” Poirot raised his hand. “Tout doucement, mon ami. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see” Poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed to be amusing him vastly. “And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!” “What on earth” “And stars give light! Voilà! Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.” I accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot addressed himself: “Pardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?” The porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out: “No. 4. Second floor.” “I thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?” “Six months.” I started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirot’s malicious grin. “Impossible,” I cried. “You must be making a mistake.” “Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.” He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside. “Eh bien, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?” I did not reply. Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going. “To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.” We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests: “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?” “Yes somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think” “That you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.” The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher. The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below. “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.” I craned my neck over the staircase. “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper. “Good. Wait awhile.” About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat. “C’est ça. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.” “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily. Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift. “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us. The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.” He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly. “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously. Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring: “Not precisely to-day,” he replied. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open. “You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes though not always then and it is against that that we are going to make provision.” He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain. On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?” “Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one of your efforts of fancy.” “It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government that of Japan, for example.",1
"""Marthe Daubreuil's beauty was undeniable, captivating Jack effortlessly. Despite his lingering attachment to another woman, his loyalty to Marthe remained unshaken. It was clear that once he discovered the truth, his feelings would turn to disgust. As for Giraud, his nerves got the best of him and he had to retreat back to Paris. Poirot's prediction proved to be accurate when Jack was finally ready to face reality, with Poirot guiding him through the harsh truth.""",1
"""The calm demeanor of handling situations didn't sit right with me. ""If you don't object,"" I began, pausing for a moment. ""Not at all. You want to conduct your own investigation, correct?"" ""I'd actually prefer to observe Giraud, if he happens to be around, and see what he's doing."" ""The human bloodhound,"" Poirot muttered, reclining in a cozy chair and shutting his eyes. ""Feel free, my friend. Goodbye."" I exited through the main entrance. The heat was quite intense. I headed down the same path we had traversed the previous day.""",1
"""The towering mountains loomed all around us, as we navigated the winding path upwards. “Is this the most efficient train to Rhodesia during the day?” inquired Anne Beddingfeld. “During the day?” chuckled Race. “My dear Miss Anne, there are merely three weekly trains. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Are you aware that we won't reach the Falls until next Saturday?” “We'll certainly be well-acquainted by then,” Mrs. Blair commented slyly. “How long do you plan to stay at the Falls, Sir Eustace?” “That remains to be seen,” I replied cautiously. “What does it depend on?” “How things unfold in Johannesburg.""",1
"“There comes a point where a man is given the opportunity to hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Indeed, indeed.” “The strikers are not the root of the issue. They are being orchestrated by an unknown entity. Weapons and bombs have been flooding in, and we have uncovered crucial documents that reveal the strategies used to bring them in. There is a specific code. Potatoes signify ‘detonators,’ cauliflower represents ‘rifles,’ while other produce indicates different types of explosives.” “Fascinating,” I remarked.",1
"""Perhaps it would have been wiser if she hadn't written it, but I refrained from mentioning that at the time. Following her instructions, you went to the curio-shop, were led through a secret passage from the back room, and found yourself in the clutches of your enemies!"" Harry glanced at me, silently communicating his thoughts, prompting me to move closer to Sir Eustace. ""Indeed, you are quite unlucky,"" Sir Eustace mumbled. ""This marks, let's see, the third encounter."" ""You're correct,"" Harry acknowledged. ""This is the third encounter. You have defeated me twice. Have you not heard that luck changes on the third attempt? It's my turn now, watch out for him, Anne."" I was prepared. In an instant, I pulled the pistol from my stocking and aimed it at his head. The two men guarding Harry lunged forward, but his words held them back. ""Take another step and he's dead! If they come any closer, Anne, pull the trigger without hesitation."" ""I won't hesitate,"" I responded cheerfully. ""I must confess, though, I'm a bit nervous about pulling it."" I believe Sir Eustace shared my apprehensions. He was visibly trembling. ""Remain where you are,"" he ordered, and the men complied. ""Tell them to leave the room,"" Harry instructed. Sir Eustace gave the command. The men exited, and Harry secured the door behind them. ""Now we can converse,"" he remarked grimly, crossing the room to retrieve the revolver from my grasp. Sir Eustace breathed a sigh of relief and wiped his brow. ""I'm terribly out of shape,"" he remarked. ""I suspect I have a weak heart. I'm relieved that the revolver is in capable hands. I didn't trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young companion, as you mentioned, now we can converse. I concede that you outmaneuvered me. I don't know where that revolver came from. I had the girl's belongings searched upon her arrival. And where did you produce it from just now? You didn't have it on you a minute ago?"" ""Yes, I did,"" I replied. ""It was in my stocking."" ""I should have taken the time to understand women better. I ought to have studied them more,"" Sir Eustace lamented. ""I wonder if Pagett would have been aware of that?"" Harry rapped on the table sharply. ""Stop the foolishness. If it weren't for your gray hair, I'd toss you out the window. You despicable scoundrel! Gray hair or not, I"" He took a few steps forward, and Sir Eustace swiftly moved behind the table. ""The youth are always so aggressive,"" he reproached. ""Lacking intellect, they rely solely on their strength. Let's speak sensibly. For now, you have the upper hand. But this situation is untenable. My men are all over the house. You are hopelessly outnumbered. Your temporary advantage was a stroke of luck."" ""Was it?"" There was something in Harry's tone, a grim mockery, that caught Sir Eustace's attention. He gazed at him. ""Was it?"" Harry repeated. ""Have a seat, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say."" Still aiming the revolver at him, he continued, ""The odds are against you this time. First, listen to that!"" There was a muffled banging at the door below. Shouts, curses, and then gunfire followed. Sir Eustace went pale. ""What's that?"" ""Race and his associates. You weren't aware, were you, Sir Eustace, that Anne and I had an agreement to verify the authenticity of communications between us? Telegrams were signed 'Andy,' letters had the word 'and' scribbled out somewhere. Anne was aware that your telegram was a forgery. She voluntarily came here, walked directly into the trap, hoping to catch you. Before leaving Kimberley, she sent messages to both Race and me. Mrs. Blair has been in contact with us ever since. I received the letter written under your direction, as I anticipated. I had already discussed the possibility of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had located the exit."" There was a screech, followed by a loud explosion that rattled the room. ""They're bombarding this part of the town. I need to get you out of here, Anne."" A bright light illuminated the room as the building across caught fire. Sir Eustace had stood up and was pacing back and forth. Harry kept him in sight with the revolver. ""As you can see, Sir Eustace, the game is over. You inadvertently provided us with the clue to your whereabouts. Race's men were monitoring the secret passage exit. Despite your precautions, they managed to track me here."" Sir Eustace suddenly turned. ""Very clever. Very commendable. But I have a final word. If I've lost this round, so have you. You'll never be able to pin Nadina's murder on me. I was in Marlow that day, that's the only thing you have against me. No one can prove that I even knew her. But you knew her, you had a motive to kill her, and your past is against you. You're a thief, don't forget, a thief. Perhaps there's one thing you're not aware of. I have the diamonds. And here we go."" With a swift motion, he bent down, raised his arm, and hurled something. The sound of shattering glass was heard as the object passed through the window and disappeared into the flaming building. ""There goes your only chance of proving your innocence regarding the Kimberley incident. Now, let's talk. I'll make a deal with you. You have me cornered. Race will find all the evidence he needs in this house. I have a chance if I can escape. It's over for me if I stay, but it's also over for you, young man! There's a skylight in the next room. If you let me out that way and give me a head start, I'll leave you a signed confession admitting to Nadina's murder."" ""Yes, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He turned to me with a stern expression.",1
"As the clock struck midnight, I found myself driving back to town, leaving my wife and uncle behind. Upon my return, a telegram was placed in my hand. It read: ""Uncle Harrington murdered last night. Bring a skilled detective. Hurry, Zoe."" With uncertainty clouding my mind, I made my way to Elmer's Dale, a desolate place surrounded by moors. The Scotland Yard inspector, Japp, greeted me with a grin, ready to share his findings. The housekeeper recounted the events of the night before, detailing the arrival of a mysterious man with a black beard. Mrs. Havering, a striking figure in her flame-colored attire, was eager to cooperate, her vivacious personality shining through the tragedy. The puzzle was set, and I was determined to unravel it.",1
"Poirot's brow furrowed as he mulled over the letter from Bella found in the dead man's pocket. The magistrate suggested reaching out to the police in Santiago for more information about the victim's past. Noticing the legacy left in the will to the secretary, Poirot speculated on the implications. The mention of the date on the will hinted at a possible premonition of danger, revealing a complex web of relationships that could shed light on the mysterious murder case.",1
"""I find the South African climate to be quite delightful."" ""I'm aware of the climate, having been there just before the war."" ""Thank you, Pedler. I'll have the package sent to General Smuts directly. The Kilmorden Castle sets sail on Saturday, a reliable vessel."" We walked along Pall Mall together briefly before saying goodbye. He shook my hand warmly, expressing gratitude once more. As I made my way home, I pondered the intricate paths of governmental decisions.",1
"There was no hint as to the identity of the thief who had stolen the million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds from the London and Scottish Bank on board the Olympia. Miss Esmée Farquhar, engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway, sought the help of Hercule Poirot to unravel the mystery. Ridgeway, visibly distressed, recounted the events leading up to the theft. The bonds, sealed in his presence by the joint general managers of the bank, vanished from his locked portmanteau on the voyage to New York. Poirot, intrigued by the case, agreed to assist and suggested lunch at the 'Cheshire Cheese' to discuss the matter further. The young couple, along with Captain Hastings, joined Poirot for lunch, eager to uncover the truth behind the disappearance.",1
"I could only imagine what Miss Pettigrew must have been thinking. For her to assume that I had the habit of summoning Anne Beddingfeld out of thin air at midnight was beyond absurd. Such a notion could be damaging to a man of my standing. ""I assume,"" I remarked icily, ""that she is in her own bed at this hour."" I cleared my throat and directed a pointed look at Miss Pettigrew, indicating my readiness to continue dictating. Hopefully, Mrs. Blair would pick up on the hint. Unfortunately, she did not. Instead, she collapsed into a nearby chair and anxiously gestured with her slippered foot. ""She's not in her room. I've checked.""",1
"Poirot and I arrived in Saint-Omer, ready to face the grim reality of Jack Renauld's imprisonment. The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, welcomed us warmly, expressing his concern for Madame Renauld's well-being. As we discussed the case, Poirot remained cautious, unwilling to reveal his true thoughts about the situation. The magistrate shared his frustrations with Jack's lack of defense, leaving us all puzzled by his silence. Despite the challenges ahead, I trusted in Poirot's abilities to uncover the truth and bring justice to those involved. We left the magistrate's office with a sense of foreboding, knowing that the mystery surrounding Jack Renauld's arrest was far from being solved.",1
"""Blair greeted me on deck, beckoning me to sit beside him. 'Good morning, Gipsy girl,' he said, noting my tired appearance. I questioned his use of the nickname, to which he explained, 'It suits you somehow. I've always thought of you that way. It's the gipsy element in you that sets you apart.' I found it amusing that we both considered each other to be the most interesting company on board, excluding Colonel Race. 'You're such an exquisitely finished product,' I remarked, mirroring his earlier sentiment.""",1
"I headed out after lunch, wearing my best hat (a hand-me-down from Suzanne) and my least wrinkled white linen. Taking a quick train to Muizenberg, I arrived in just thirty minutes. The journey was pleasant as we circled around the foot of Table Mountain, passing by some beautiful flowers. Due to my poor geography skills, I had never fully grasped that Cape Town is situated on a peninsula. So, I was taken aback when I stepped off the train and found myself staring at the sea once again. The sight of people enjoying the water was truly delightful.",1
"I met Japp at the Matlock Arms and he led me straight to the body of Harrington Pace. Pace, an American, had been shot in the head at close range. Japp suspected Mrs. Havering's husband, but his alibi checked out. The murder weapon was found, but the killer remained at large. I sent a detailed report to Poirot, including a new clue - a revolver found near the crime scene. A wire from Poirot arrived the next morning, revealing that the black-bearded man was not Mr. Havering. More investigation was needed to crack the case.",1
"“Insisting on coming straight to me was the right call,” he continued. “Minks may be a clever actor, but he’s a fool. That person you saw downstairs? That was Minks.” I responded weakly, “Oh, really.” Sir Eustace then cheerfully said, “Now, let’s talk facts. How long have you known I was the ‘Colonel’?” I replied, “Ever since Mr. Pagett mentioned seeing you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace ruefully nodded, “Yes, I told that fool he had messed up. He didn’t get it, though. All he cared about was whether I recognized him. Never crossed his mind to question what I was doing there. Just plain bad luck.”",1
"""But before we proceed, we require some information. Please ring the bell,"" I requested. Upon doing so, Poirot paced back and forth while we waited for a response, his keen eyes taking in the orderly surroundings. ""Mr. Marsh is a man of great method. Note the meticulous organization of the papers and the ivory labels on each drawer and cabinet key. Even the china cabinet is impeccably arranged. It is truly a sight to behold, nothing out of place,"" he remarked. Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a dirty envelope attached to the key of the desk, bringing his movements to a sudden halt.",1
"""They’re just acquaintances, really, even Suzanne. The person who penned that note must have possessed a vast amount of insider information. It certainly wasn't the work of an outsider,"" I calmly mentioned the note this time, without a trace of embarrassment. ""If you were to follow my advice,"" he began, pausing. ""I doubt that I will,"" I responded honestly. ""But I'm willing to listen."" ""Do you always follow your own desires, Miss Beddingfeld?"" ""Typically,"" I cautiously replied. With anyone else, I would have said ""Always."" ""I feel sorry for your husband,"" he unexpectedly remarked. ""There's no need for that,"" I shot back.",1
"He showed great kindness to his brother’s orphaned child, bringing me into his home and caring for me as if I were his own daughter. The estate, Crabtree Manor, may sound grand but is actually just a humble farmhouse. My uncle, deeply passionate about farming, was always trying out new agricultural methods. Despite his affection for me, he held firm beliefs about the proper upbringing of young women. Lacking formal education himself, he placed more importance on practical skills than on academic learning.",1
"It's quite possible that many individuals around the globe are unaware of the discovery of an ancient skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. One morning, I found Papa in a state of extreme excitement, almost to the point of apoplexy. He proceeded to recount the entire tale to me. ""Do you see, Anne? While there are indeed certain similarities to the Java skull, they are merely superficial. No, what we have here is what I've always argued to be the prototype of the Neanderthal lineage. Do you agree that the Gibraltar skull is the most archaic among the Neanderthal specimens discovered? It all traces back to Africa, the birthplace of the race.""",1
"“What reason would he have to do that? Especially with criminals and killers roaming the streets every minute! Ridiculous! The man was not foolish. It’s not like he had to release that woman.” The judge interjected abruptly: “That woman? Which lady are you referring to?” “Why, the woman who visited him.” “A woman had visited him that night?” “Of course, sir, and on many other nights too.” “Who was she? Were you acquainted with her?” A sly expression crossed the woman’s face. “How would I know who she was?” she grumbled. “I didn’t let her in last evening.",1
"""He appeared deep in thought, his forehead furrowed in concentration. It was clear that his sharp mind was finally kicking into gear. The anticipation grew as we waited for him to speak. Suddenly, breaking the silence, he turned to Japp and inquired, 'Do you happen to know if Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim shared a bedroom?' The question caught us off guard, leaving us momentarily speechless. Japp couldn't help but burst into laughter. 'Oh Monsieur Poirot, I was expecting something much more dramatic!'""",1
"I recited the numbers as they appeared before me. “1 71 22.” “Look,” Suzanne pointed out, “it’s similar, but not quite. It’s still one o’clock, and the 22nd, but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” Our eyes locked, thrilled by our revelation and consumed by anticipation as if we had unraveled the entire enigma. Then reality hit me hard. “But, Suzanne, nothing significant occurred here at one o’clock on the 22nd.” Her expression mirrored disappointment. “No, nothing did.” Another thought crossed my mind. “This isn’t the cabin you originally reserved, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you were initially assigned?” “No, the purser switched me to it.” “I wonder if it was pre-booked before departure for someone who never showed up.”",1
"I quickly realized that the girl was more interested in the crime scene than I had anticipated. Her fascination with the gruesome details was unsettling, but I couldn't deny the thrill of showing her around. As we approached the shed, I hesitated, knowing what we were about to see would be disturbing. But she was eager to continue, her curiosity outweighing any sense of caution. Inside, I revealed the victim's body, the sight of which caused her to recoil in horror. It was clear she had underestimated the impact of the scene. I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction as she struggled to come to terms with the reality of the crime. In the end, she learned that some things are better left unseen.",1
"”Pondering the new realm of possibilities unveiled by Poirot’s deductions, I reflected on his enigmatic references to the flower bed and wrist watch. Initially seeming insignificant, his comments now revealed his astute unraveling of the mystery at hand. I silently praised my friend’s methodical approach, which he acknowledged with a wise nod. “Method is key,” he affirmed. “Organize your facts, organize your thoughts. And if a detail seems out of place, scrutinize it instead of dismissing it.”",1
"She was a tall, striking young woman who arrived promptly, dressed simply yet elegantly, exuding confidence and professionalism. I've never been a fan of the so-called New Woman, and despite her attractiveness, I was not immediately swayed in her favor. ""My business with you, Monsieur Poirot, is rather unconventional,"" she started, settling into her seat. ""I believe it is best to start from the beginning and provide you with the full details."" ""Please, go ahead, mademoiselle."" ""I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, both sons of a humble farmer in Devonshire.""",1
"""Giraud is in agreement with me, are you not, sir?"" Regardless of Giraud's true beliefs, he assumed the position without any visible reaction. Coolly and almost contemptuously, he responded: ""Indeed, I concur."" The crowd murmured in surprise and interest once more. ""But how absurd!"" exclaimed M. Hautet. ""To stab a man after he's already dead! Savage! Unprecedented! Perhaps driven by an insatiable hatred."" ""No, Judge,"" Poirot interjected. ""I suspect it was carried out with complete premeditation to make an impact."" ""What kind of impact?"" ""The kind of impact it almost achieved,"" replied Poirot enigmatically. M. Bex pondered for a moment. ""So, how did the man meet his end?"" ""He was not killed. He perished.""",1
"“Sorry to interrupt you, but could you please open Mr. Opalsen’s room for me?” The woman stood up willingly, and we followed her down the corridor. Mr. Opalsen’s room was located on the opposite side of the hallway, facing his wife’s room. The chambermaid used her pass-key to unlock the door, and we entered. Before she left, Poirot stopped her. “Just a moment; have you ever come across a card like this among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings?” He handed her a plain white card, with a glossy finish that looked rather unusual. The maid examined it closely. “No, sir, I can’t say that I have. But the valet usually takes care of the gentlemen’s rooms.” “I understand. Thank you.” Poirot took back the card and the woman left. Poirot seemed to ponder for a moment. Then he nodded briskly. “Please ring the bell three times for the valet, Hastings.” I complied, consumed by curiosity. Meanwhile, Poirot emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor and began sifting through its contents. Shortly after, the valet responded to the bell. Poirot asked him the same question, showing him the card for inspection. Yet again, the answer was negative. The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s possessions. Poirot thanked him, and he left, casting a curious glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the mess on the floor. It was almost inevitable that he overheard Poirot’s pensive comment as he tidied up the torn papers: “And the necklace was heavily insured…” “Poirot,” I exclaimed, “I understand!” “You understand nothing, my friend,” he replied swiftly. “As always, absolutely nothing! It’s astonishing, but that’s the truth. Let’s go back to our rooms.” We did so in silence. Once there, to my great surprise, Poirot swiftly changed his attire. “I’m heading to London tonight,” he said. “It’s crucial.” “What?” “Absolutely. The real work, that of the mind (oh, those little grey cells), is complete. I need to seek confirmation. And I will find it! Hercule Poirot cannot be deceived!” “You’ll make a mistake one day,” I remarked, somewhat put off by his arrogance. “Don’t be angry, please, my friend. I’m counting on your friendship for a favor.” “Of course,” I responded eagerly, feeling ashamed of my grumpiness. “What do you need?” “Could you brush the sleeve of the coat I just removed? There’s a bit of white powder on it. You probably noticed me running my finger around the dressing-table drawer?” “No, I didn’t.” “You should pay attention to my actions, my friend. I collected the powder on my finger, and, in my excitement, I accidentally rubbed it on my sleeve; a careless act that goes against all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I inquired, not particularly interested in Poirot’s principles. “Not the poison of the Borgias,” Poirot replied, with a glint in his eye. “I see your imagination wandering. It was most likely French chalk.”",1
"When the petite man had completed his business with me, he joined his companion, and together they compelled my husband to stand and go with them into the adjacent dressing-room. Despite my overwhelming fear, I strained to listen intently. Their voices were hushed, preventing me from catching their words. However, the dialect was familiar, a corrupted form of Spanish heard in select regions of South America. It was evident that they were pressuring my husband for something, as their agitation escalated with raised voices. The taller man appeared to take the lead. 'You are aware of our demands!' he exclaimed.",1
"And my Reminiscences were coming along splendidly! I had crafted some incredibly clever exchanges between myself and the leaders of the strike. This morning, I found myself face-to-face with a suave, charming, and enigmatic Government official. He subtly hinted at my influential status and hinted that I should relocate to Pretoria, either voluntarily or involuntarily. ""Anticipating some unrest, are you?"" I inquired. His response was deliberately vague, indicating that they were bracing for significant upheaval. I pointed out to him that his Government was allowing the situation to escalate dangerously.",1
"""He’d arranged the stones on the path to create an illusion, luring unsuspecting victims into danger. If I get my hands on him, he'll regret it!"" After a pause, his tone shifted: ""We've avoided discussing these matters, Anne. It's time. You need to hear the whole truth from the very beginning."" ""If revisiting the past is painful for you, please don't feel obligated,"" I whispered softly. ""But I need you to understand. I never imagined I'd reveal that part of my past to anyone. Fate has a strange way of testing us, doesn't it?"" There was a moment of silence before he spoke again.",1
"I perched on the edge of my cot, clad in my vibrant gipsy attire, mulling over the predicament. My mind drifted to Colonel Race, who had shown me favor. I believed he would offer compassion and intelligence. However, upon further reflection, doubts crept in. His forceful demeanor could easily overshadow my ownership of the case. It was my puzzle to solve! Unspoken motives lingered, dissuading me from entrusting Colonel Race. My thoughts then turned to Mrs. Blair, another source of kindness.",1
"""Pedler was deceived into thinking Rayburn was his new secretary, not Mr. Pagett,"" Suzanne whispered anxiously, her hand squeezing mine under the table. ""But where is Rayburn now?"" I held my breath, eager for an answer. ""He's vanished without a trace,"" came the reply. ""And Sir Eustace?"" Suzanne inquired. ""He sees it as a direct affront from Fate."" Later that day, we were interrupted from our nap by a note delivered by a page-boy, providing us with a chance to hear Sir Eustace's perspective on the situation.",1
"Suzanne and I were strategizing about our targets. Mr. Chichester heading to Durban, Sir Eustace to Cape Town and then Rhodesia. Colonel Race was also on his way to Rhodesia. The plan was to keep an eye on them all. However, danger struck when I was attacked on deck. My mysterious rescuer turned out to be the man with the scar. Another shadow joined in, revealing the identity of my assailant - Guy Pagett. The discovery left us all stunned. Suspicion hung heavy in the air, with secrets waiting to be revealed.",1
"""Absolutely not,"" I stated firmly. ""My great-aunt Jane always used to claim that a true lady remains unfazed by any event,"" I whispered wistfully. ""I strive to embody her teachings."" Observing Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew's thoughts written plainly on his countenance, I felt compelled to continue speaking. ""Your skill in disguise is truly remarkable,"" I complimented sincerely. ""Throughout your time as Miss Pettigrew, I never once suspected, not even when you dropped your pencil in astonishment at my appearance on the train in Cape Town."" He drummed his fingers on the desk with the pencil clutched in his hand.",1
"""I had considered leaving in a month's time."" ""Could you leave sooner? This month? This week?"" ""Yes, I could,"" I replied, studying him intently. ""But I'm not sure if I really want to."" ""Your help would be greatly appreciated by the Government. You would not be disappointed."" ""So, you want me to deliver something?"" ""Yes, exactly. Your role is unofficial, your trip is legitimate. Everything will be perfectly fine."" ""Alright,"" I hesitated, ""I suppose I can. All I want is to leave England as soon as I can.""",1
"Poirot's eyes narrowed as he stared at Dr. Ames, his green cat-like gaze unwavering. ""Do you not believe in Ancient Egypt, monsieur le docteur?"" he asked softly. Dr. Ames, taken aback, stammered for a response. Poirot, without waiting for an answer, inquired about the thoughts of the native workmen. ""I guess they're getting scared,"" Dr. Ames admitted. ""But they've no reason to be."" Poirot's expression remained inscrutable as Sir Guy expressed disbelief in Poirot's ideas. With a swift movement, Poirot produced a tattered book titled The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans. Without a word, he left the tent, leaving the doctor puzzled.",1
"During my analysis, I noticed that the original text excerpt contains 1103 spaces. Here is the revised text excerpt with approximately the same number of spaces:""The altercation with the vagrant occurred prior to the incidents.” “To confirm that, you may need to interrogate Mademoiselle Dabreuil once more.” “Not necessary. I am certain. If you can't see it, you're clueless, Hastings!” I stared at him. “Of course! How foolish of me. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the heated confrontation with him that Mr. Renauld sensed danger. He dismissed the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of collusion, he messaged his son, and summoned you.” A slight grin appeared on Poirot’s face. “Do you not find it odd that he used the exact same phrases in his letter as Madame Renauld did later in her account? If the mention of Santiago was a diversion, why would Renauld bring it up, and furthermore dispatch his son there?” “It is perplexing, but maybe clarity will come later. Let’s move on to the night, and the arrival of the enigmatic woman. I confess this puzzles me greatly, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise insisted all along.” Poirot shook his head. “My dear fellow, where is your mind wandering? Consider the torn cheque scrap, and the faint recognition of the name Bella Duveen by Stonor, indicating that Bella Duveen is Jack’s unnamed correspondent, and that she visited Villa Geneviève that evening. Whether she intended to see Jack, or if her aim was to confront his father, we cannot say for sure, but it seems likely. She presented her claim to Jack, likely showed him letters he had written, and the elder man tried to appease her with a cheque. She tore it up in anger. The tone of her letter suggests genuine affection, and she likely would have been insulted by a monetary offer. Eventually, he managed to get her to leave, and his choice of words at that moment is telling.” “‘Yes, yes, but please leave now,’” I recalled. “Seems a bit forceful, perhaps, that’s all.” “It speaks volumes. He was desperate for her to depart. Why? Not just because the encounter was unpleasant. No, it was the ticking clock, and for some reason time was of the essence.” “But why?” I inquired, puzzled. “That is the question. Why indeed? Yet, the incident with the wristwatch later on indicates that time is a crucial element in this crime. We are nearing the climax. Bella Duveen departs at half past ten, and based on the wristwatch evidence, we know the crime occurred, or was staged, before midnight. We have examined all the events leading up to the murder, only one remains unaccounted for.""",1
"I had been dancing with Colonel Race several times that evening and we eventually ended up sitting in deck-chairs, engaged in conversation. He seemed to have a lot of knowledge in a particular subject, but I couldn't help but notice a few mistakes he made. One in particular stood out - he referred to the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian, which was a clear error. As I retired to my cabin that night, I couldn't shake the feeling that he might have been testing me, perhaps suspecting that I was not who I claimed to be. It was a puzzling thought that lingered in my mind as I drifted off to sleep.",1
"""But Sir, he was as dark as a thundercloud all day! Couldn't please him at all!"" The noise of a door closing upstairs interrupted Léonie's chatter. ""And Françoise is waiting for me!"" she cried, suddenly remembering her responsibilities. ""That old one, always scolding."" ""Just a moment, miss. The inspector, where is he?"" ""They went to check the car in the garage. The commissioner thought it might have been used on the night of the murder."" ""What an idea,"" Poirot muttered, watching the girl vanish. ""Will you go out and join them?"" ""No, I'll wait for them in the lounge. It's cooler there on this hot morning.""",1
"“Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him. His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do. I don’t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise. There’s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you’re a sensible young woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him” “I won’t do anything of the kind.” “Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl. You’ll have to trust me and hope for the best. Of course, if you’re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that’s another matter.” This was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace’s dictation: Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any possible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to Agrasato’s curio-shop. Ask to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” The man will then ask you to “come into the back room.” Go with him. You will find a messenger who will bring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the diamonds with you. Not a word to any one. Sir Eustace stopped. “I leave the fancy touches to your own imagination,” he remarked. “But be careful to make no mistakes.” “‘Yours for ever and ever, Anne,’ will be sufficient,” I remarked. I wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through. “That seems all right. Now the address.” I gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a consideration. He struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew, alias Minks, answered the summons. “This letter is to go immediately the usual route.” “Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror. No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He’s not to leave the house without orders.” He put the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping the table with his hand. “May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,” I said, after a minute or two of silence. “Certainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.” “Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden. Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the Kilmorden_ either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right. It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never read the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all did, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22. The thing I don’t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer instinct.” “And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?” “My dear Anne, you don’t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar. When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after me! I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since. He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place. I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something. There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here. But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there. I admit that I haven’t had time to examine them yet, but I notice that one is of a totally different weight to the others, rattles in a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down with seccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener. The case seems clear, does it not? And now, you see, I have you both nicely in the trap. It’s a pity that you didn’t take kindly to the idea of becoming Lady Pedler.” I did not answer. I stood looking at him. There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph. “According to plan,” he said softly. “You amateurs will pit yourselves against professionals.” “What’s the meaning of this?” cried Harry hoarsely. “It means that you have walked into my parlour said the spider to the fly,” remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. “My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.” “You said I could come safely, Anne?” “Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself. She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room and found yourself in the hands of your enemies!” Harry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to Sir Eustace. “Yes,” murmured the latter, “decidedly you are not lucky! This is let me see, the third encounter.” “You are right,” said Harry. “This is the third encounter. Twice you have worsted me have you never heard that the third time the luck changes? This is my round cover him, Anne.” I was all ready. In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order. The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know. I had the girl’s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn’t got it on you a minute ago?” “Yes, I had,” I replied. “It was in my stocking.” “I don’t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table. “The young are always so violent,” he said reproachfully. “Unable to use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk sense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of affairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are hopelessly outnumbered. Your momentary ascendency has been gained by an accident” “Has it?” Something in Harry’s voice, a grim raillery, seemed to attract Sir Eustace’s attention. He stared at him. “Has it?” said Harry again. “Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say.” Still covering him with the revolver, he went on: “The cards are against you this time. To begin with, listen to that!” That was a dull banging at the door below. There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race and his people. You didn’t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne.” A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him covered with the revolver. “So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up. It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race’s men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.” Sir Eustace turned suddenly. “Very clever. Very creditable. But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you. You’ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that’s all you’ve got against me.",1
"The detective from Scotland Yard exuded disdain, Major Norman appeared disinterested, and I myself felt time dragging on endlessly. Restlessly, I rose from my seat and made my way to the window without making a sound. The situation was turning into a comedy of errors. Concern for my friend weighed on me. If he were to fail, I wished it would be in a less absurd fashion. I absentmindedly gazed out the window at the departing boat, billowing smoke from its stack at the dock. Poirot's sudden voice near me snapped me back to reality. ""My friends, it's time to go!"" I turned around.",1
"I jumped up. Harry stood on the stoep outside. ""Get dressed, Anne, and come out. I need to talk to you."" I quickly put on some clothes and went out into the cool night air, still and fragrant, with a velvety touch. Harry motioned for me to come out of earshot of the house. His face was pale and resolute, his eyes ablaze. ""Anne, do you remember telling me once that women do things they dislike for someone they like?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, curious about what he was about to say. He embraced me. ""Anne, come away with me tonight. Back to Rhodesia, back to the island. I can't stand this anymore. I can't wait any longer for you."" I pulled away for a moment. ""And what about my French dresses?"" I joked. Harry never knows when I'm joking or serious. ""Forget the French dresses. Do you think I want to dress you up? I'd rather take them off you. I'm not letting you go. You're mine. If I let you leave, I might lose you. I'm never sure of you. You're coming with me tonight, and to hell with everyone else."" He held me close, kissing me passionately. ""I can't be without you any longer, Anne. I can't. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Let's go."" ""My toothbrush?"" I hesitated. ""You can buy one. I know I'm crazy, but please, come with me!"" He stormed off at a brisk pace. I followed quietly, like the Barotsi woman I once saw at the Falls. But without a frying pan on my head. He walked so fast, it was hard to keep up. ""Harry,"" I finally said in a meek voice, ""are we walking all the way to Rhodesia?"" He turned abruptly, laughing loudly, and swept me up in his arms. ""I'm mad, my love, I know it. But I adore you so much."" ""We're both lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked, but I'm not sacrificing anything at all! I wanted to come!"" That was two years ago. We still reside on the island. On the rough wooden table in front of me lies a letter from Suzanne. Dear Friends, I'm not surprised at all. All the talk about Paris and dresses made me feel like you would disappear one day to get married secretly. You are a pair of lunatics! Renouncing a huge fortune is ridiculous. Colonel Race wanted to argue, but I convinced him to wait. He can manage the estate for Harry perfectly. Because honeymoons don't last forever. Anne, since you're not here, I can say that without you attacking me. Love in the wilderness will last, but one day you'll start dreaming of Park Lane houses, luxurious furs, Parisian dresses, fancy cars, and top-notch baby carriages! Oh, you will! Have a long honeymoon, dear lunatics, and think of me sometimes, enjoying life! Love, Suzanne. P.S. I'm sending you a variety of frying pans as a wedding gift, and a huge terrine of pâté de foie gras to remind you of me.",1
"Instead of looking at me, she let out a little chuckle and said, ""Anne, you're quite the unconventional girl, aren't you? Haven’t you ever felt any doubts?"" ""Doubts?"" I inquired, perplexed. ""Yes, doubts, doubts, doubts! Setting off alone with hardly any money. What will you do when you're stranded in a foreign land with no money left?"" ""No point worrying about that until it happens. I still have a good amount of money. The twenty-five pounds from Mrs. Flemming is intact, and I won fifteen pounds in a sweepstake yesterday. I have plenty of money. Forty pounds!"" ""Plenty of money! My goodness!"" murmured Mrs. Blair. ""I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I consider myself brave in my own way. I couldn’t embark on an adventure with just a few pounds and no plan,"" Mrs. Blair added. ""The thrill of it is what makes it exciting,"" I responded, feeling invigorated. ""It's a sense of adventure."" She nodded, smiled, and said, ""Not many people share your perspective."" ""Well,"" I said impatiently, ""what do you make of all this, Mrs. Blair?"" ""I find it incredibly thrilling! Now, let's get to the point. You mentioned that the man who was stabbed and sought refuge in your cabin was Sir Eustace’s secretary, not Pagett, the other one. Is that correct?"" I nodded. ""That gives us two connections tying Sir Eustace to the mystery. The woman was murdered in his house, and his secretary was stabbed at one o'clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but there must be a connection somewhere, even if he's unaware of it."" ""Then there's the peculiar stewardess,"" she continued thoughtfully. ""What did she look like?"" ""I barely noticed her. But yes, I did find her face familiar. It could be because I saw her around the ship."" ""Her face seemed familiar to you,"" Suzanne remarked. ""Are you sure she wasn’t a man?"" ""She was tall,"" I admitted. ""Not Sir Eustace or Mr. Pagett, then,"" Suzanne pondered. ""Wait!"" She hastily drew a sketch and examined it closely. ""A striking resemblance to the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now, for the rest."" Passing the sketch to me, she asked, ""Is that your stewardess?"" ""Yes, Suzanne, you're spot on!"" I exclaimed. ""How clever of you!"" Dismissing the compliment, she said, ""I've always had my suspicions about that Chichester character. Remember how he reacted when we discussed Crippen the other day?"" ""And he tried to get Cabin 17!"" ""Yes, it all fits so far. But what is the significance of it all? What was meant to happen at one o'clock in Cabin 17? It couldn’t have been the stabbing of the secretary. It must’ve been some sort of appointment, and he was on his way to it when he was attacked. But who was the appointment with? Not you, certainly. Perhaps Chichester. Or maybe Pagett."" ""That seems unlikely,"" I objected. After a brief silence, Suzanne switched gears. ""Could there have been something hidden in the cabin?"" ""That's a possibility,"" I agreed. ""It might explain why my things were ransacked the next morning. But I’m certain there was nothing hidden there."" ""Could the young man have slipped something into a drawer the night before?"" ""I would’ve noticed,"" I replied. ""Could it have been the paper they were searching for?"" ""Perhaps, but it seems pointless. It was only a time and a date, and they were both in the past,"" I mused. Suzanne nodded. ""That makes sense. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, do you still have it? I’d like to take a look."" I handed her the paper, and after examining it closely, she exclaimed, ""There's a flaw in the paper! You have to ignore it and focus on the spaces!"" Reading out the figures, I said, ""1 71 22."" ""It's the same, but not quite. It’s still one o'clock and the 22nd, but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!"" As we revelled in our discovery, a sudden realization hit me. ""But, Suzanne, nothing significant occurred here at one o'clock on the 22nd?"" Her expression mirrored my disappointment. ""No, it didn’t."" Another thought crossed my mind. ""This isn’t your original cabin, is it, Suzanne? The one you booked?"" ""No, the purser reassigned me to it,"" she replied. ""I wonder if it was reserved for someone who didn’t show up. We could find out,"" I suggested. ""We don’t need to investigate, Gipsy girl,"" cried Suzanne. ""I know! The cabin was reserved in the name of Mrs. Grey, but she was actually Madame Nadina, the renowned Russian dancer. She’s a notorious figure, suspected of espionage. Nadina is just the woman to be involved in this. The appointment on the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?"" A sudden realization dawned on me. ""She intended to sail,"" I said slowly. ""Then why didn’t she?"" ""Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!"" As the pieces of the puzzle started to fit together, I remembered something. ""Your films! The ones passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?"" ""The ones I lost?"" ""How do you know they were the same? Why would someone return them to you in the middle of the night?"" She handed me a tin cylinder, and as I opened it, a collection of diamonds spilled out. ""Diamonds!"" Suzanne exclaimed. ""Diamonds!"" I echoed, captivated by the sight. ""The diamonds are what everyone is after. It must have been to get hold of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina."" ""He didn’t kill her,"" I asserted. ""Of course he did. Who else could have?"" ""I don’t know. But I’m certain he didn’t kill her."" Suzanne mulled over the events and suggested, ""Let’s cable Lord Nasby that you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ Your fortune’s made, Anne!"" As we delved deeper into the mystery, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that Colonel Race was somehow involved. ""Who is Colonel Race?"" I inquired. ""He’s quite mysterious, often rumored to be involved in Secret Service work,"" Suzanne answered. ""He must be quite wealthy,"" I remarked. ""Yes, a splendid catch for you,"" Suzanne teased. ""I don’t want to get married,"" I asserted. ""Why not? I love being married to Clarence!"" ""What I want to know is, what does Colonel Race have to do with all this?"" ""He’s definitely a key player in this mystery,"" Suzanne concluded. As we continued to unravel the intricate web of events, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to the story than met the eye.",1
"I had a feeling of unease regarding Bella. Her infatuation with Jack Renauld was so intense that she would have done anything for him. However, when Jack's behavior towards her changed and he stopped communicating as frequently, Bella became increasingly agitated. She became convinced that he had feelings for another woman, a suspicion that was later proven to be true. Despite my objections, Bella decided to travel to their Villa in Merlinville to confront Jack. Aware of her intentions, she attempted to evade me. Upon discovering that she was not on the train in Calais, I made the decision not to proceed to England without her.",1
"He provided me with detailed directions on how to reach the destination. It was heartening to know that my dear father was still held in high regard. I anticipated being given a personal tour of the Museum before departing Cape Town, but I was willing to take that risk. While most would have found it enjoyable, I had grown weary of such experiences, having been exposed to them constantly. Donning my finest hat (a hand-me-down from Suzanne) and the least wrinkled white linen outfit, I set off after lunch. I boarded a swift train to Muizenberg, arriving in approximately thirty minutes. The journey was delightful, as we meandered leisurely around the foot of Table Mountain, admiring the beautiful flowers along the way. Due to my limited knowledge of geography, I had never fully grasped that Cape Town is situated on a peninsula, so I was somewhat taken aback upon disembarking the train and finding myself facing the ocean once more. The sight of people engaging in delightful bathing activities was captivating. They skillfully rode the waves on short, curved boards. Although it was too early for tea, I headed towards the bathing pavilion. When asked if I wanted a surf board, I eagerly accepted. Surfing appeared deceptively easy. It was not. I shall say no more. Frustrated, I angrily cast aside my board. Nevertheless, I was determined to try again at the earliest opportunity. Defeat was not an option. By chance, I managed to catch a good wave on my board, emerging from the water brimming with joy. Surfing evokes such extreme emotions - either vehement cursing or a sense of foolish pride. After some difficulty, I located Villa Medgee. Perched on the mountainside, it stood apart from the other residences. Upon ringing the bell, I was greeted by a cheerful Kafir boy. ""Mrs. Raffini?"" I inquired. He led me inside, guiding me down the corridor and opening a door. Just as I was about to enter, a sudden sense of apprehension washed over me. Stepping over the threshold, the door closed abruptly behind me. Rising from his seat behind a table, a tall man approached me with a welcoming smile. ""We are delighted that you decided to honor us with a visit, Miss Beddingfeld,"" he declared. It was evident that he was Dutch, sporting a fiery orange beard. He bore no resemblance to a museum curator. In that moment, I realized my grave mistake. I had unwittingly walked into the lion's den. This scenario vividly reminded me of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.” How many times had I sat in the cheap seats, nibbling on a bargain chocolate bar, yearning for similar adventures to befall me? Well, my wish had been granted, albeit not as amusing as I had envisioned. It is easy to find humor in such situations on screen, knowing that there will always be an Episode IV. But in reality, there was no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress would survive beyond any given episode. Yes, I was in a precarious situation. The unsettling words of Rayburn earlier that day echoed in my mind with unsettling clarity.",1
"As I watched the tall young man approaching, his lean, deeply bronzed face caught my attention. It spoke of a life in a tropic clime. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered upon seeing him, her face noticeably blanched. ""You,"" she gasped. ""I thought you were on your way to East Africa."" The young man explained that news from his lawyers had detained him, as his uncle in Scotland had unexpectedly left him some money. At that moment, Poirot stepped forward, making introductions and emphasizing our imminent return to London. We quickly made our way to the Anchor Inn where Captain Black was staying, ready to investigate his connection to the events surrounding Mr. Maltravers' death.",1
"... She couldn't bear to see him suffer! Would she be the one to seal his fate? Guilty of many things, but innocent of the crime they accused her of. Yet, her charm and charisma prevailed. In a whirlwind of emotions, Madame Beroldy was found not guilty. Despite the police's best efforts, Georges Conneau remained elusive. And as for Madame Beroldy, she vanished without a trace, taking the child with her to start anew. The Beroldy case, with all its intricacies, is now documented. Not every detail is crystal clear in my mind as I recollect the events.",1
"""Witnessed by the two maids, Denise and Françoise. Nothing particularly unusual about that.” He handed it over. “Maybe,” started Bex, “you didn't observe ” “The date?” sparkled Poirot. “Oh, but I did. A fortnight ago. Maybe it signifies his first hint of danger. Many wealthy men pass away without a will by never thinking about the possibility of their death. However, it's risky to jump to conclusions too soon. Nevertheless, it indicates his genuine affection and love for his wife, despite his romantic affairs.” “Indeed,” replied M.",1
"“That’s irrelevant. This is all Pagett’s doing. He overworks me to no end. I can’t wait to leave him behind in Cape Town.” “He’s staying here?” “Yes, he’ll have a grand time investigating Rayburn. That’s the kind of thing Pagett loves. But I’m serious about my offer. Will you join me? Mrs. Blair can chaperone, and you can take breaks to explore.” “Thank you, Sir Eustace,” I replied cautiously. “But I plan to depart for Durban tonight.” “Don’t be stubborn. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll enjoy them. All girls do.” “Will they be doing low jumps?” I asked, jokingly. “No, thank you, but I really must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace gave me a look, sighed, then called for Pagett. “If you’re done with your nap, my dear fellow, perhaps you can do some work for a change.” Guy Pagett entered the room, bowing to us and looking surprised at my presence. “I’ve been typing that memo all afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Stop typing. Go to the Trade Commissioner’s Office or the Chamber of Mines and find me a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not mind if I hold her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I’ll find a capable shorthand-typist.” “Pagett is a sly one,” Sir Eustace remarked after he left. “I bet he’ll choose a woman just to annoy me. She must have nice feet too, forgot to mention that.” I grabbed Suzanne’s hand excitedly and pulled her to her room. “Suzanne, we need to plan quickly. Pagett is staying here, did you hear that?” “Yes, so I won’t be able to go to Rhodesia, which is annoying. But I want to go. How frustrating.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going. I don’t see how you can back out now without looking suspicious. And if Pagett is suddenly called away by Sir Eustace, it will be harder for you to join him for the journey.” “It wouldn’t be proper,” Suzanne dimpled. “I’d have to pretend a crush on him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you’re there when he arrives, it will be natural. We shouldn’t ignore Colonel Race and Sir Eustace entirely.” “Anne, you can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everyone,” I said ominously. “In detective stories, it’s always the least likely person who’s the villain. Many criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t fat or cheerful,” Suzanne pointed out. “Sometimes they’re lean and solemn,” I retorted. “I don’t seriously suspect them, but the murder did happen in Sir Eustace’s house.” “We don’t need to go over that. I’ll keep an eye on him, and if he gets fatter and happier, I’ll send you a telegram immediately. ‘Sir E. growing suspicious. Come quickly.’” “Suzanne, this is not a game!” I exclaimed. “I know, but it feels like one. Your sense of adventure has rubbed off on me. If Clarence knew I was running around Africa chasing criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why not cable him about it?” Suzanne considered it seriously. “I might. It would have to be a long one.” She brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with harmless fun.” “You’ll watch Sir Eustace and Colonel Race,” I instructed. “I know why I need to watch Sir Eustace, but why suspect Colonel Race? He’s involved in the Secret Service. We should tell him everything.” I objected strongly to this idea. Suzanne, due to her marriage, sought a man to rely on. She promised not to tell Colonel Race and we continued with our plans. “I need to stay here and watch Pagett. I’ll pretend to leave for Durban tonight, change my appearance, and stay in a small hotel in town. I’ll have a better chance of seeing what he’s up to if he thinks I’m gone.” Suzanne approved this plan. We made preparations, asked about the train to Rhodesia, and had dinner together. Colonel Race was absent, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table. Pagett left midway through the meal, disrupting my plans to say goodbye. I approached Sir Eustace instead. “Farewell, Sir Eustace. I’m leaving for Durban tonight.” Sir Eustace sighed. “I heard. Would you like me to accompany you?” “I’d love that.” “Nice girl. Are you sure about Rhodesia? Perhaps a young man in Durban has caught your eye. By the way, Pagett is leaving in the car soon. He could drop you at the station.” “No, thank you. Mrs. Blair and I have a taxi arranged.” Going with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted. Sir Eustace noticed. “I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. He’s an interfering fool who does everything to annoy me!” “What has he done now?” I asked, curious. “He found a secretary for me. You wouldn’t believe it! She’s forty, wears glasses and sensible shoes, and is too efficient. A real slab-faced woman.” “Won’t she let you hold her hand?” “I hope not!” Sir Eustace exclaimed. “That would be too much. Well, goodbye, liquid eyes. If I catch a lion, I won’t give you the skin after abandoning me.” He squeezed my hand and we parted. Suzanne was waiting in the hall. “Let’s leave now,” I hurriedly said, signaling for a taxi. A voice stopped me. “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, I’m going in a car. I can drop you at the station.” “Thank you, but there’s no need. I” “No trouble, I assure you. Load the luggage, porter.” I was trapped. I might have argued, but Suzanne nudged me to be cautious. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I replied coldly. We all got in the car. As we drove, I pondered what to say. Eventually, Pagett spoke. “I found a capable secretary for Sir Eustace. Miss Pettigrew.” “He didn’t seem pleased with her earlier,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me sternly. “She’s a skilled typist,” he stated. We arrived at the station. I thought Pagett would leave, but he didn’t. “I’ll see you off. Your train leaves in fifteen minutes.” He directed the porters efficiently. I stood, unable to look at Suzanne. He suspected. He ensured I caught the train. What could I do? Nothing. In fifteen minutes, I would be on the train with Pagett waving me goodbye from the platform. He had outmaneuvered me. His demeanor had changed, filled with forced geniality that sickened me. He was a hypocrite. First he tried to kill me, now he was being kind. Did he think I hadn’t recognized him on the boat? It was an act, one I had to play along with. I was helpless, following his instructions. My luggage was in my compartment. It was eight twelve. The train was about to depart. But Suzanne intervened. “It’ll be hot, Anne,” she remarked. “Especially through the Karoo. Do you have cologne or lavender water?” I seized the opportunity. “Oh no, I left it at the hotel,” I exclaimed. Suzanne commanded Pagett. “Mr. Pagett, quickly. There’s a chemist across the station. Anne needs cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s authority won out. He went. Suzanne watched him go, then urged me to exit the other side in case he was watching. I left, leaving my luggage and telegraphed about it the next day. I found a hotel, got a room, paid a deposit, and went to sleep. The next morning, I bought new clothes and decided to wait until most of the party left for Rhodesia on the eleven o’clock train. I took a tram for a walk, and my untied shoelace led to a surprising encounter with a mysterious man.",1
"""Lord Estair, I can only tell you that if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I would have laughed in his face,"" Monsieur Poirot said, keenly observing. ""And today?"" ""Today, I do not know what to think,"" Lord Estair replied, gesturing in despair. Poirot nodded solemnly, glancing at his watch. ""I must have carte blanche, messieurs, in every way. I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose."" ""Absolutely. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard.""",1
"Hautet pondered. “It seems somewhat unjust to leave the son at the mercy of his mother, should she remarry and her new husband gain control. The boy may never see a cent of his father’s wealth.” Poirot simply raised an eyebrow. “Humans are prideful creatures. Perhaps M. Renauld assumed his widow would remain single. And entrusting the money to his son's mother could have been a calculated move. Wealthy heirs are often known to be reckless.” “Your theory could hold true. Now, M.",1
"A few moments later, he returned with Mrs. Renauld. ""Madame is here,"" he announced. Giraud approached with a brief nod. ""Follow me, madame."" Leading her across the room, he suddenly stepped aside. ""Here stands the man. Do you recognize him?"" His piercing eyes studied her face intently, searching for any hint of emotion or familiarity. However, Mrs. Renauld remained unnervingly composed, almost too composed in my opinion. She gazed down at the body with little interest, showing no signs of distress or recognition. ""No,"" she replied calmly. ""I have never laid eyes on him before.""",1
"I had embarked from Southampton on the 17th, carrying a precious paper that bore the numbers 17, 1, and 22. My deduction was that 17 referred to Cabin 17 and 1 to one o'clock. As tomorrow was the 22nd, I was convinced that something significant would occur at 1 a.m. My evening was restless as I awaited the appointed hour. When it came, I heard the hurried footsteps of a man outside my cabin. Without hesitation, I concealed him from pursuers, all while maintaining the appearance of a lady washing her neck. The unexpected arrival of a stewardess provided a moment of tension, but the drunk intruder in my cabin turned out to have been stabbed. Despite his defiance, I tended to his wound, demanding no gratitude in return.",1
"""But who could have done it?"" I asked, looking around the room for any clues. Poirot remained silent, a thoughtful look on his face. It was clear that he was deep in contemplation, trying to piece together the puzzle that lay before us. Suddenly, he spoke up. ""It must be someone close to the victim,"" he said, his eyes narrowing. I nodded, realizing the gravity of the situation. We were dealing with a cunning criminal, one who had managed to cover their tracks with precision. As we delved deeper into the case, I couldn't shake the feeling that the answer was right in front of us, waiting to be uncovered. The truth was out there, lurking in the shadows, and it was up to us to bring it to light.",1
"""But why Marlow?"" I questioned, feeling the weight of the circumstances pressing down on me. ""It was a mistake, but in the moment it felt right. It still feels right, given the circumstances."" ""What circumstances?"" I demanded, desperation creeping into my voice. Pagett finally turned his attention to me, realizing my inquiry. ""I apologize, Miss Beddingfeld,"" he responded coldly, ""but I fail to understand your involvement in this situation."" As he leaned in closer, I could sense my desperation growing.",1
"""I specifically chose No. 17, and the purser told me I could have it."" ""I apologize,"" I stated icily. ""But No. 17 has already been assigned to me."" ""I cannot accept that."" The steward interjected. ""The other cabin is just as good, if not better."" ""I insist on having No. 17."" ""What is going on here?"" a new voice demanded. ""Steward, move my belongings here. This is my cabin."" It was the man I had lunch with, Rev. Edward Chichester. ""I apologize,"" I replied. ""It is assigned to Sir Eustace Pedler,"" Mr. Pagett explained. Tensions were rising. ""I regret having to disagree,"" Chichester said with a meek smile that failed to conceal his determination to have his way. Meek men are always stubborn, in my experience.",1
"Papa never cared for the opinions of others, living detached from daily life and always mildly pained when it came to money matters. Despite his academic celebrity, he remained unknown to the general public. Except for one instance when a newspaper twisted his words for a sensational headline. I longed for excitement and love, stuck in a routine life. But little did I know that adventure was closer than I thought. A thrilling discovery at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia had Papa in a frenzy, claiming it to be the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. And with that, we set off on a journey, eager to uncover the mysteries of the past.",1
"""Perhaps it would have been wiser if she hadn't written it, but I refrained from mentioning that at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were led through the secret passage from the back room, and found yourself in the clutches of your enemies!"" Harry gave me a knowing look. I understood his glance and moved closer to Sir Eustace. ""Indeed,"" Sir Eustace murmured, ""it seems luck is not on your side! This marks, let me see, the third encounter."" ""You are correct,"" Harry acknowledged. ""This is the third encounter. Twice you have bested me. Have you never heard that luck changes on the third try? This round is mine. Cover him, Anne."" I was prepared. In an instant, I had drawn the pistol from my stocking and had it aimed at his head. The two men guarding Harry lunged forward, but his voice halted them. ""Another step and he's dead! If they approach any closer, Anne, pull the trigger without hesitation."" ""I won't hesitate,"" I responded cheerfully. ""I'm actually quite afraid of pulling it, to be honest."" I believe Sir Eustace shared my apprehension. He was visibly trembling. ""Stay where you are,"" he ordered, and the men obeyed. ""Tell them to exit the room,"" Harry instructed. Sir Eustace gave the command. The men left, and Harry locked the door behind them. ""Now we can converse,"" he stated grimly, crossing the room to take the revolver from my hand. Sir Eustace breathed a sigh of relief and wiped his brow with a handkerchief. ""I'm terribly out of shape,"" he remarked. ""I suspect I have a weak heart. I'm relieved that the revolver is in capable hands. I didn't trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I'm willing to concede that you outmaneuvered me. Where in the world did that revolver come from? I had the girl's belongings searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from just now? You didn't have it on you a moment ago."" ""Yes, I did,"" I replied. ""It was in my stocking."" ""I should have studied women more. I don't know enough about them,"" Sir Eustace lamented. ""I wonder if Pagett would have known?"" Harry pounded on the table sharply. ""Stop playing games. If it weren't for your gray hair, I'd toss you out the window. You scoundrel! Gray hair or not, I—"" He took a step forward, and Sir Eustace deftly moved behind the table. ""The young are always so hasty,"" he chided. ""Unable to think, they rely solely on their physical strength. Let's speak sensibly. At the moment, you have the upper hand. But that will not last. My men are scattered throughout the house. You are hopelessly outnumbered. Your temporary control is due to a fluke."" ""Is it?"" Something in Harry's tone, a mocking seriousness, caught Sir Eustace's attention. He gazed at him. ""Is it?"" Harry repeated. ""Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say."" Still aiming the revolver at him, he continued, ""The odds are against you this time. To start, listen to that!"" A muffled banging could be heard at the door below. There were yells, curses, and then the sound of gunshots. Sir Eustace went pale. ""What's that?"" ""Race and his associates. You weren't aware, were you, Sir Eustace, that Anne and I had an agreement to verify the authenticity of our communication? Telegrams were to be signed 'Andy,' and letters were to have the word 'and' crossed out somewhere. Anne knew that your telegram was fake. She willingly came here, walked straight into the trap, hoping to ensnare you. Before departing Kimberley, she sent telegrams to both me and Race. Mrs. Blair has been in contact with us ever since. I received the letter dictated by you, which was as anticipated. I had already discussed with Race the likelihood of a hidden passage leading out of the curio-shop, and he had identified the location of the exit."" There was a screeching, ripping noise, followed by a loud explosion that shook the room. ""They are bombarding this area. I need to get you out of here, Anne."" A bright flame erupted. The house across the street was ablaze. Sir Eustace stood up and paced back and forth. Harry kept him in his sights with the revolver. ""So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is over. You kindly provided us with the clue to your whereabouts. Race's men were monitoring the exit of the secret passage. Despite the precautions you took, they succeeded in tracking me here."" Sir Eustace suddenly turned. ""Very clever. Very commendable. But I have one more thing to say. If I've lost this round, so have you. You will never be able to pin Nadina's murder on me. I was in Marlow that day, that's all you have against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive to kill her, and your past is against you. You're a thief, don't forget, a thief. There is one thing you may not know. I have the diamonds. And here goes."" With a swift motion, he bent down, raised his arm, and threw. There was a tinkling of shattered glass as the object flew through the window and disappeared into the inferno outside. ""There goes your only chance of proving your innocence in the Kimberley incident. Now, let's talk. I'll make a deal with you. You have me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. I have a chance if I can escape. I'm finished if I stay, but so are you, young man! There's a skylight in the adjacent room. With a couple minutes' lead, I'll be safe. I have a few arrangements in place. You let me go that way, grant me a head start, and I'll leave you a signed confession admitting to Nadina's murder."" ""Yes, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He fixed a stern gaze on me.",1
"Carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a precise line, a satisfied grin on his face. Time ticked by. The Opalsens remained absent. ""Interesting,"" I commented, breaking the silence. ""I wonder when they'll reappear."" Poirot observed the smoke spiraling upwards before stating, ""They won't be returning."" ""But why?"" I inquired. ""What makes you so sure?"" Poirot's smile widened. ""Just a while back, the manager dashed out of his office and hurried upstairs. Clearly, something has gone amiss.""",1
"Poirot had humiliated me completely. It was time to teach him a lesson. I planned to wait before forgiving him. He had led me into making a complete fool of myself! After being away for a few days, I returned to find Poirot preparing to leave. ""Good timing, Hastings. I was worried you wouldn't make it back in time to join me."" ""Are you leaving for a case?"" ""Yes, although I must say, this one doesn't seem very promising at first glance. The Northern Union Insurance Company has requested that I look into the death of a Mr. """,1
"Renauld's smile faded as she shook her head at M. Hautet. ""There's nothing romantic about it, I assure you,"" she said. M. Hautet nodded in agreement. ""Let's not get carried away with melodrama. But there is something else,"" he added, pausing for a moment. Before he could continue, Stonor interrupted eagerly, ""It's unbelievable, Mrs. Renauld. They think Mr. Renauld was involved with a Madame Daubreuil who lives next door."" Mrs. Renauld blushed deeply, her expression changing rapidly. Stonor watched her, surprised by her reaction, while M. Hautet remained silent.",1
"My father passed away when I was a child. A few years later, my mother also died. I was left with only my Uncle Andrew, who took me in and treated me like his own daughter. He strongly believed in practical skills over book knowledge and was against women receiving education. Despite his wishes, I pursued my studies and won a scholarship. When my uncle passed away, I discovered that he had left a challenging will, giving me a year to prove my intelligence. I sought the help of Monsieur Poirot to unravel the mystery hidden within Crabtree Manor. We were welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. Baker, who had worked for my uncle. The next morning, our investigation began in earnest in the late Mr. Marsh's study.",1

Come on, give me the grand tour.” “Hold on a second, I can’t do that. It’s off limits to everyone. They enforce the rules strictly.” “Aren’t you two big shots?” I was reluctant to let go of my sense of importance. “What’s driving your curiosity?” I asked hesitantly. “And what exactly do you want to see.”",1
"Poirot and Japp were discussing the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Davenheim. Japp revealed that they found Mr. Davenheim's clothes near the lake, but not his body. They also arrested a suspect named Lowen, who was seen near the study on the day of the disappearance. Additionally, a man named Billy Kellett pawned Mr. Davenheim's ring in London. Poirot doubted that Lowen was the murderer, citing lack of evidence. He suggested that the ring may have been removed from the body to divert suspicion. Japp mentioned a lime kiln near the lake where the body could have been disposed of. Poirot then made a startling revelation about Mr. Davenheim's true whereabouts, leaving everyone in shock.",1
"The juvenile members of the human species display certain characteristics resembling those of anthropoids, while the young chimpanzees exhibit similarities to humans more so than adult chimpanzees. This suggests that our predecessors had greater Simian traits than we do, whereas chimpanzees' ancestors were of a more advanced nature compared to the current species, implying that the chimpanzee is in decline. The resourceful publication, the Daily Budget, in need of sensational material, promptly published bold headlines. ""Are we the ancestors of monkeys, or are monkeys our descendants? Distinguished Professor claims chimpanzees are deteriorating versions of humans.""",1

The unexpected arrival of Bella threatens to derail his carefully orchestrated scheme, forcing him to act quickly to eliminate her interference. With every passing moment crucial to the success of his plan, Renauld wastes no time in dispatching Bella and setting in motion the next phase of his deadly plot. Leaving the front door slightly open, he skillfully manipulates the scene to divert attention from his true intentions.",1
"He was sprawled out near a small copse. It seemed he was hunting rooks, a small rifle lay by his side. The bleeding appeared to be sudden. Definitely a gastric ulcer."" ""No indication of a gunshot wound, correct?"" ""Absolutely not!"" ""I apologize,"" Poirot said meekly. ""But, if I recall correctly, in a prior murder case, the doctor initially concluded heart failure but changed it to a gunshot wound after the constable noticed a bullet hole in the head!"" ""There are no bullet wounds on Mr. Smith's body.""",1
"""It appears highly probable that Pagett is responsible for the murder of Anita Grünberg in Marlow, adding credibility to the idea that he is indeed the elusive 'Colonel.' Given the sensitive nature of Anita's work, it seems unlikely that she would confide in a subordinate. The only factor contradicting this hypothesis is the failed attempt on your life the night you arrived here. Pagett was clearly left in Cape Town, making it impossible for him to have reached this location before the following Wednesday. It is doubtful that he has any associates in this area, as all his preparations were made to intercept you in Cape Town.""",1
"""As I opened the door to turn on the lights, a sudden darkness enveloped the room. Lady Yardly's scream pierced the air as the necklace was violently torn from her neck. In the chaos, we found the necklace abandoned near the side door, missing the Star of the East. A piece of silk from a Chinaman's robe caught in the door revealed the thief's identity. In a panic, the thief escaped into the night. The police were summoned, and Lady Yardly recounted the attack. Just as hope seemed lost, news arrived that Miss Marvell's diamond had also been stolen. My warnings had been ignored, and now the consequences were dire.""",1
"""Furthermore, in this instance.” Leaning in, he extracted an object from the dagger's handle and displayed it before me. It was a strand of long, black hair, reminiscent of the one Poirot had retrieved from the armchair in the library. With a faintly mocking grin, he wrapped it around the dagger once more. ""Let us maintain the status quo as much as possible,"" he remarked. ""It satisfies the examining magistrate. Well, do you perceive anything else?"" I was compelled to shake my head. ""Examine his hands."" I complied. The nails were ragged and stained, the skin calloused. It provided little insight, much to my disappointment. I glanced at Giraud.",1
"I couldn't stand not knowing the woman's name, so I decided to take a casual walk inside to search. Perhaps she was in the lounge. Merlinville was a small town with the beach as the main attraction. A casino was under construction, but not open yet. After scanning the beach with no luck, I concluded she must be in the hotel. Upon entering, I scanned the small lounge but didn't spot her. I checked other rooms, but she was nowhere to be found.",1
"""It's strange, don't you think? Could it be haunted?"" ""Haunted flat? Never heard of such a thing,"" Parker stated firmly. ""No,"" Mrs. Robinson seemed skeptical. ""But there were some odd things that caught my attention."" ""Like what?"" I inquired. ""Ah,"" Parker chimed in, ""our expert in crime is intrigued! Share your thoughts with him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is skilled at unraveling mysteries."" I chuckled, feeling awkward yet slightly flattered by the role assigned to me.",1
"A message from Poirot greeted me as I sat down to breakfast the next day: “It is clear that the man with the black beard was not Havering, only you or Japp would entertain such a notion. Send me details about the housekeeper and her attire this morning, as well as Mrs. Havering's. Skip the interior photographs - they lack artistry.” I found Poirot's tone needlessly sarcastic. It seemed to me that he might be envious of my advantage in being on site to handle the investigation. While his request for clothing descriptions struck me as absurd, I obliged as best as a mere man could.",1
"The statements, though absurd and baseless, were fervently believed by many. Despite this, the prosecution remained relentless in their pursuit of justice. They refuted the existence of the mysterious ""Russians"" and instead accused Madame Beroldy and her accomplice, Georges Conneau, of the crime. While a warrant was issued for Conneau's arrest, he had cunningly vanished. It was revealed that the restraints holding Madame Beroldy were in fact loose enough for her to escape at any moment.",1
"""Because,” he exclaimed, “it is vital that I am there to witness its impact on me, just as it did on you.” “What?” I inquired. “Yes, to ensure my attendance! Upon reviewing the letter, he felt dissatisfied. It lacked the necessary force!” Pausing briefly, he continued with a glint in his eyes: “Hence, my friend, given that the postscript was not an impulsive addition, but a deliberate one, time is of the essence, and we must locate him without delay.” “Merlinville,” I pondered aloud. “The name sounds familiar.” Poirot simply nodded.",1
"The lady occupying the cabin on the Kilmorden was Mrs. Blair, who interviewed the purser upon boarding. The steward mistook her for the real lady in question, Carton, who arranged a transaction involving diamonds. As the ship approached Cape Town, Miss Beddingfeld grew suspicious of Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace, and his secretary, Mr. Pagett. A conversation about Florence revealed Mr. Pagett's uneasiness, prompting Miss Beddingfeld to confront him about a possible guilty secret. Despite his initial reluctance, Mr. Pagett eventually opened up about his experiences in Italy, including the pictures and olive trees.",1
"In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation while Ned made inquiries about Sir Eustace's party. I told Harry I wouldn't go to Beira. It was decided I would join Suzanne and focus on self-preservation. The diamonds would be deposited under the name of Parker. I suggested a code: any message from me would have 'and' crossed out, wires signed 'Andy.' Ned mentioned the train's imminent arrival. Anne teased Harry about marriage, to which he responded possessively. Just then, Mrs. Blair barged in frantically looking for Anne.",1
"""In those days, she did not go by the name of Madame Daubreuil,"" Poirot corrected me with a smile. ""That woman in the picture is the infamous Madame Beroldy!"" Suddenly, memories flooded back to me. The sensational Beroldy Case, a murder trial that had captured global attention. Around twenty years prior to the events of our story, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, hailing from Lyons, had made his way to Paris with his beautiful wife and their young daughter.",1
"“You wouldn’t want me to accompany you, would you?” “I would enjoy it very much.” “Lovely girl. Are you certain you won’t reconsider and come search for lions in Rhodesia?” “Absolutely certain.” “He must be quite the dashing chap,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “Probably some young upstart in Durban who outshines my more mature charms. By the way, Pagett is heading down in the car shortly. He could give you a ride to the station.” “Oh, no, thank you,” I replied quickly. “Mrs. Blair and I have already arranged for our own taxi.” The thought of going with Guy Pagett was the last thing I desired! Sir Eustace studied me intently. “I don’t think you care for Pagett. I don’t blame you. A pompous, meddlesome fool parading around as if he were a martyr, doing everything possible to trouble and upset me!” “What has he done now?” I asked with curiosity. “He’s found me a secretary. You wouldn’t believe the woman! At least forty, wears glasses and sensible shoes, with an air of brisk efficiency that drives me crazy. A real no-nonsense woman.” “Will she be holding your hand?” “I sincerely hope not!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “That would be unbearable. Well, goodbye, enchanting eyes. If I happen to shoot a lion, I won’t be giving you the skin after you’ve abandoned me in such a manner.” He squeezed my hand warmly and we went our separate ways. Suzanne was waiting for me in the lobby. She was coming to see me off. “Let’s depart immediately,” I said quickly, signaling for a taxi. Then a voice behind me startled me: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m driving down. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair off at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I responded hastily. “But it’s not necessary. I” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Load the luggage, porter.” I was at a loss. I could have argued further, but Suzanne discreetly nudged me to be cautious. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said frostily. We all entered the car. As we sped down the road towards town, I tried to think of something to say. Eventually, Pagett broke the silence. “I have found a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he mentioned. “Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly singing her praises just now,” I pointed out. Pagett gave me a cold look. “She is an expert shorthand typist,” he said sternly. We arrived at the station. Surely he would leave us now. I turned to shake his hand but no. “I’ll see you off. It’s eight o’clock, your train leaves in fifteen minutes.” He efficiently directed the porters. I stood helpless, unable to meet Suzanne's eyes. He suspected. He was determined to ensure that I caught the train. And what could I do? Nothing. I envisioned myself, in fifteen minutes' time, departing from the station with Pagett standing on the platform bidding me farewell. He had cleverly turned the tables on me.",1
"I wiped away my tears, feeling the lingering weakness in my body. Gripping his hand tightly, I wished for a peaceful death in that moment, under his watchful gaze. His eyes held a new intensity, a protective glint that soothed me. ""Please, Anne, no more tears. You're safe now,"" he reassured me, offering a cup of milk. I drank without hesitation, listening to his comforting words, spoken in a gentle, coaxing tone. ""Rest now, don't worry. Let your strength return. No need for questions."" And with that, I drifted back into slumber, feeling reassured by his presence.",1
"Nonetheless, the case came back to me with surprising clarity. It had caused quite a stir in the past, extensively covered in the English newspapers. Remembering the key details required little effort on my part. In my current state of exhilaration, everything seemed to fall into place. I must confess, I tend to act on impulse, a habit that Poirot often criticizes. However, in this particular instance, I believe my hastiness was justified. The way in which this new revelation aligned with Poirot’s perspective was truly remarkable. Without hesitation, I turned to Poirot and exclaimed, “Congratulations, Poirot.""",1
"""I was preparing for a lengthy journey, unsure when I would return. It was important for me to see her one last time, to make sure she knew my feelings were unwavering."" Poirot maintained unbreakable eye contact as he questioned Renauld's actions. After a significant pause, Renauld finally responded, confirming that he did see her. ""What happened next?"" Poirot pressed. ""I missed the final train, so I trekked to St. Beauvais and managed to secure a car from a nearby garage to transport me back to Cherbourg."" ""St. Beauvais? That's quite a distance to walk, M. Renauld."" ""I needed the time to think."" Poirot nodded in understanding as Renauld made his exit, grabbing his hat and cane before disappearing into the night.",1
"""His hands do not belong to a gentleman,"" he remarked as he glanced at me. ""Yet his attire suggests he is a man of means. Quite intriguing, isn't it?"" I nodded in agreement. ""And his clothes bear no distinguishing marks. What does that tell us? This individual was attempting to conceal his true identity. He was wearing a disguise. But for what reason? Was he running from something? Trying to evade capture by masking himself? At this moment, we cannot say for certain. However, one thing is clear - he was as determined to hide his true self as we are to uncover it."" He shifted his gaze back to the body. ""Once again, there are no fingerprints on the dagger's handle. The culprit once more wore gloves."" ""So you believe the same person committed both crimes?"" I inquired eagerly. Giraud's expression turned inscrutable. ""It matters not what I believe. Time will tell. Marchaud!"" The police officer entered the room. ""Yes, sir?"" ""Why hasn't Mrs. Renauld arrived yet? I sent for her fifteen minutes ago."" ""She's making her way up the path now, sir, with her son."" ""Excellent. I only require one of them at a time, though."" Marchaud saluted and left. Soon after, he returned with Mrs. Renauld. ""Madame, please come this way,"" Giraud said with a brief nod. Leading her closer, he suddenly stepped aside. ""Here is the deceased. Do you recognize him?"" His sharp eyes scrutinized her face, searching for any hint of recognition or emotion. But Mrs. Renauld remained composed - perhaps too composed, I thought. She gazed down at the body almost disinterestedly, showing no signs of distress or identification. ""No,"" she replied. ""I've never seen him before. He's a complete stranger to me."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Absolutely."" ""You don't see him as one of your attackers, for instance?"" ""No,"" she hesitated, as if considering the possibility. ""No, I don't believe so. They did wear fake beards, as the magistrate suggested, but still, no."" Finally, she made up her mind. ""I'm positive neither of them was this man."" ""Very well, madame. That will be all,"" Giraud said. She left with her head held high, the sunlight catching the silver strands in her hair. Jack Renauld followed, also failing to identify the deceased in a perfectly natural manner. Giraud simply grunted. His thoughts remained inscrutable. He called out to Marchaud, ""Is the other one here?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Bring her in."" ""The other"" referred to Madame Daubreuil. She entered indignantly, vehemently protesting. ""I object, sir! This is an outrage! What does this have to do with me?"" Giraud cut her off bluntly, ""Madame, I am not investigating just one murder, but two! For all I know, you could be responsible for both."" ""How dare you?"" she exclaimed. ""How dare you accuse me with such a baseless claim! It's scandalous."" ""Scandalous, you say? And what about this?"" Bending down, he plucked a strand of hair and held it up. ""Do you see this, madame?"" He approached her. ""May I compare it to yours?"" With a gasp, she stumbled backwards, turning pale. ""It's not mine, I swear it. I have no knowledge of either crime.""",1

"I decided against taking that path due to its high level of risk. Instead, I adorned my finest hat and made my way somberly through the town to speak with our understandably furious grocer. The sole young man to visit our home was a reporter from the Daily Budget. At moments, I found myself envious of Emily, our young maid, who would stroll out with a handsome sailor she was engaged to whenever the opportunity arose.

The Anzora was delayed twenty-four hours due to engine trouble. I would have sailed last night instead of the night before, but, seeing an evening paper, I read about the awful tragedy that had occurred."" His voice cracked and tears filled his eyes. ""My poor father, my poor, poor father."" Mrs. Renauld, staring at him, repeated, ""You didn't sail?"" And then, with weariness, she murmured to herself, ""It doesn't matter now."" ""Please, M. Renauld, have a seat,"" said M. Hautet, pointing to a chair. ""I offer you my deepest sympathy. It must have been a terrible shock to hear the news as you did. We hope you can provide us with the information we need to solve this mystery."" ""I am at your service, M. le juge. Ask me anything you wish."" ""To start, I understand this journey was at your father's request?"" ""Yes, M. le juge. I received a telegram instructing me to travel to Buenos Ayres via the Andes to Valparaiso and Santiago."" ""Ah. And the purpose of this trip?"" ""I have no idea, M. le juge."" ""What?"" ""No. Here is the telegram."" The magistrate read it aloud. ""Proceed immediately to Cherbourg, embark on the Anzora sailing tonight to Buenos Ayres. Final destination Santiago. Further instructions in Buenos Ayres. This matter is very important. Renauld."" ""You did not know about this beforehand?"" ""That was the only communication I received. I knew my father had many interests in South America, but he never mentioned sending me there."" ""You have been to South America before, M. Renauld?"" ""I was there as a child, but I was educated in England. I know very little about South America. The war began when I was seventeen."" ""You were in the English Flying Corps, correct?"" ""Yes, M. le juge."" And so the questioning continued, with Jack Renauld denying any knowledge of his father's enemies or secrets, focusing on the business aspect of the journey. Giraud then took the lead with his questions, digging into a recent argument between Jack and his father regarding Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil, who Jack wished to marry. Mrs. Renauld, aware of the attachment, expressed her concerns about Marthe's mother. The tension in the room escalated as family secrets were revealed, leading to the shocking disappearance of a crucial piece of evidence.",1
"""If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain.""",1
"Diamonds had been discovered in the vicinity of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers in the past, but John Eardsley and Lucas made a groundbreaking find of extensive carbon deposits at the confluence of two rivers. The diamonds they unearthed displayed a wide array of colors - pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and pristine white. Eardsley and Lucas traveled to Kimberley to have their precious gems evaluated, coinciding with a shocking heist at the De Beers establishment. Whenever diamonds are shipped to England, they are carefully packaged into a secure parcel.",1
"""Race, please, share with us the details,"" he prompted. ""Of course, I will divulge the tale. I'm sure you are all familiar with Sir Laurence Eardsley, the prominent South African tycoon? Although his wealth stemmed from gold mines, his son is the focus of this narrative. Prior to the War, rumors circulated about a potential new Kimberley hidden in the rocky terrain of the British Guiana rainforest. According to reports, two daring explorers had recently journeyed back from that region of South America, showcasing an extraordinary assortment of uncut diamonds, including some notably large ones.""",1
"I scoured every corner, feeling increasingly frustrated. After slamming shut the final book, it became clear - Kilmorden Castle was nowhere to be found. This discovery was perplexing. Who would fabricate such a location and jot it down on paper? Ridiculous! Another possibility dawned on me. Maybe it was a pretentious mansion on the outskirts, adorned with a grandiose name coined by its wealthy owner. However, if that were the case, locating it would prove to be quite the challenge.",1
"""For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He stammered and flushed. “Oh, quite so, yes er quite so.” Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table. “I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race. “Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a stern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn’t been asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend. I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in sight.""",1
"""Leave now. Run as fast as you can. I'll keep him distracted."" With a quick glance in my direction, she bolted out of the room. I tightened my grip on Poirot. ""My friend,"" he said calmly, ""you have a talent for this. Holding me like a vice, rendering me helpless. But this is all rather uncomfortable and somewhat absurd. Let's sit down and compose ourselves."" ""You're not going after her?"" ""Mon Dieu! No. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend."" Watching him closely, knowing I was no match for his cunning, I loosened my hold and he settled into an armchair, rubbing his arms. ""You possess the strength of a bull when provoked, Hastings! Well, have you acted honorably towards your old friend? I show you the girl's photo, you recognize her, yet you say nothing."" ""I didn't need to, knowing you already recognized her,"" I replied bitterly. Poirot had been aware all along! I hadn't fooled him for a second. ""Ta-ta! You didn't know that I knew that. And tonight, you aid the girl's escape after we went to great lengths to find her! Well, it comes down to this - are you with me or against me, Hastings?"" I hesitated for a moment. Breaking ties with my old friend pained me deeply. But I had to take a stand against him. Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been surprisingly composed thus far, but I knew of his remarkable self-control. ""Poirot,"" I began, ""I apologize. I admit I've wronged you in this matter. But sometimes, there's no choice. From now on, I must follow my own path."" Poirot nodded thoughtfully. ""I understand,"" he said. The mocking gleam had vanished from his eyes, replaced by a sincerity and kindness that caught me off guard. ""It's love, isn't it? Love didn't come as you expected, all cheerful and grand. Instead, it arrived with a heavy heart and weary feet. I warned you. When I realized the girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you recall. But it was already too late. But tell me, how much do you know?"" I met his gaze squarely. ""There's nothing you could tell me that would surprise me, Poirot. But in case you plan on continuing your search for Miss Duveen, I want you to understand one thing clearly. If you suspect her involvement in the crime or if she was the mysterious woman who visited Mr. Renauld that night, you're mistaken. I travelled back from France with her that day, and parted ways with her at Victoria in the evening. So, it's impossible for her to have been in Merlinville."" ""Ah!"" Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. ""And would you swear to that in a court of law?"" ""Absolutely,"" I replied. Poirot stood up and bowed.",1
"A short time later, I found myself face to face with a stranger in the study. He had a muscular build and a sun-kissed complexion. An unmistakable scar stretched from his eye to his jaw, marring an otherwise attractive yet daring face. ""So,"" I began, ""what brings you here?"" ""Mr. Milray has instructed me to assist you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your aide."" ""I already have a personal assistant,"" I replied. ""I have no need for another."" ""I beg to differ, Sir Eustace. I believe you do.""",1
"""Madame Daubreuil, the woman from Villa Marguerite down the road?"" ""Yes, that's who I mentioned, sir. She's quite a looker, that one!"" The elderly woman tossed her head disdainfully. ""Madame Daubreuil,"" murmured the commissary. ""Unbelievable."" ""Exactly,"" grumbled Françoise. ""That's the thanks you get for telling the truth."" ""Not at all,"" said the examining magistrate reassuringly. ""We were just surprised, that's all. Madame Daubreuil and Monsieur Renauld, they were..."" he paused delicately. ""Eh? It was definitely them?"" ""How would I know? But what can you do? Monsieur, he was a very rich English lord and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one, and very stylish despite living quietly with her daughter. No doubt, she has a past! She's not young anymore, but my word! I've seen men turn their heads after her as she walks down the street. Lately, she's been spending more money, everyone in town knows it. The little savings are gone."" And Françoise shook her head with an air of unwavering certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard thoughtfully. ""And Madame Renauld?"" he asked after a pause. ""How did she take this friendship?"" Françoise shrugged. ""She was always very friendly and polite. You'd think she suspected nothing. But still, isn't it true that the heart suffers, sir? Day by day, I watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She wasn't the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, changed. It was clear he had his own worries. One could see he was on the edge of a nervous breakdown. And who could blame him, with an affair conducted in such a manner? No discretion, no restraint. Very English style, no doubt!"" I fumed in my seat, but the examining magistrate continued his questioning, undeterred by the side issues. ""You mentioned that M. Renauld didn't see Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left then?"" ""Yes, sir. I heard them leave the study and head to the door. Monsieur bid her good night and closed the door after her."" ""What time was that?"" ""Around twenty-five minutes past ten, sir."" ""Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?"" ""I heard him go upstairs about ten minutes after we did. The stairs creak so loudly, you can hear everyone who goes up and down."" ""And that's all? You heard no disturbances during the night?"" ""Nothing at all, sir."" ""Which servant came down first in the morning?"" ""It was me, sir. And immediately I saw the door swinging open."" ""What about the other ground floor windows, were they all locked?"" ""Every single one. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere."" ""Very well, Françoise, you may leave."" The old woman shuffled towards the door. At the threshold, she glanced back. ""I'll tell you one thing, sir. That Madame Daubreuil is a troublemaker! Oh, yes, one woman knows another. She's trouble, remember that."" And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise exited the room. ""Léonie Oulard,"" called the magistrate. Léonie appeared in tears, close to hysteria. M. Hautet handled her skillfully. Her testimony mainly focused on finding her mistress tied up and gagged, which she described in an exaggerated manner. Like Françoise, she heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, followed. She agreed that her master had changed significantly recently. ""Every day he got more and more gloomy. He ate less. He was always downcast."" But Denise had her own theory. ""It must have been the Mafia after him! Two masked men, who else could it be? A dreadful organization that!"" ""It's a possibility, of course,"" said the magistrate smoothly. ""Now, my dear, were you the one who let Madame Daubreuil into the house last night?"" ""Not last night, sir, the night before."" ""But Françoise just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?"" ""No, sir. A lady did visit M. Renauld last night, but it wasn't Madame Daubreuil."" Surprised, the magistrate persisted, but the girl stood her ground. She knew Madame Daubreuil by sight. This lady was dark as well, but shorter and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. ""Had you seen this lady before?"" ""Never, sir."" And then the girl added shyly: ""But I think she was English."" ""English?"" ""Yes, sir. She asked for M. Renauld in very good French, but one can always tell by the accent, right? Besides, when they left the study, they were speaking English."" ""Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it?"" ""I speak English very well,"" said Denise proudly. ""The lady was speaking too quickly for me to catch, but I heard Monsieur's last words as he opened the door for her."" She paused, then repeated carefully: ""'Yes yes, but for God's sake go now!'"" ""Yes, yes, but for God's sake go now!"" echoed the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a brief moment of thought, called Françoise back. He asked her if she might have made an error in identifying the night of Madame Daubreuil's visit. However, Françoise remained stubborn. It was definitely last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt, it was her. Denise just wanted attention, that's all! So she had concocted this story about a mysterious lady. Showing off her English knowledge too! Probably Monsieur had never uttered that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it meant nothing, as Madame Daubreuil spoke English fluently and usually used that language when speaking to M. and Madame Renauld. ""You see, M. Jack, Monsieur's son, was usually around, and he spoke French very poorly."" The magistrate didn't press the issue. Instead, he inquired about the chauffeur and found out that just yesterday, M. Renauld had mentioned he wouldn't be needing the car, and that Masters might as well take a break.",1
"I enjoy my exclusive Club, a competitive game of Bridge, a gourmet meal, and a fine glass of wine. I prefer the charm of England during the summer months and the luxury of the Riviera in winter. I have no interest in being part of sensational events. Occasionally, by the fireplace, I don't mind reading about them in the news. However, I draw the line there. My main goal in life is to be completely at ease. I've invested time and money to achieve that, though success is not always guaranteed. Even if I don't seek out excitement, it seems to find me, and I often find myself entangled in unexpected situations.",1
"""I have no intention of dressing you in frocks. I'm more inclined to rip them off of you. You belong to me, understand? If I let you go, I might lose you. I'm bringing you with me tonight, no matter what anyone says."" He embraced me tightly, kissing me deeply. ""I can't be without you any longer, Anne. I despise this wealth. Let Race take it. Come with me. Let's leave."" ""But my toothbrush?"" I hesitated. ""You can buy a new one. I know I'm crazy, but please, come with me!"" He stormed off in a rage.",1
"He managed to get the case dismissed, but it destroyed the lives of two young men, staining their reputation as thieves. The father disowned his son, unable to bear the betrayal of the family name. The son, in his pride, remained silent, refusing to defend his innocence. Enraged, he enlisted in the war with his friend, who tragically lost his life due to reckless behavior. The father's bitterness towards a woman stemmed from his friend's deeper connection to her, leading to a series of events that awakened a sense of justice in him.",1
"""But much to my surprise, I suddenly heard a faint sound coming from the deck behind me, followed by his calm and friendly voice: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I spun around. “I must offer you my sincerest apologies. My behavior last night was completely uncalled for.” “It was quite an unusual evening,” I replied quickly. It wasn't the most coherent response, but it was all I could muster. “Can you find it in yourself to forgive me?” I extended my hand silently. He accepted it. “There is another matter I need to address.” His expression grew more serious.""",1
"""I must confess, Monsieur Poirot, that I have a rather pressing matter to discuss with you today,"" the young woman stated with a polite nod as she took her seat. ""I assume you are familiar with the recent headlines regarding the theft of Liberty Bonds at the Olympia."" Poirot's expression betrayed a hint of surprise, prompting her to elaborate without delay. ""You may be wondering what a person like myself has to do with the esteemed London and Scottish Bank. The truth is, Monsieur Poirot, I am actually engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway."" ""Ah, Mr. Philip Ridgeway,"" she continued. ""He happened to be the custodian of the stolen bonds.""",1
"""He's heading out of Cape Town today, to meet Sir Eustace in Johannesburg,"" she mentioned casually. I nodded, processing the information. ""And the children, where are they?"" I inquired. ""Most likely with Sir Eustace,"" she replied. After contemplating for a moment, I finally spoke up, ""It's a tricky situation, but I believe it's best to hold off for now."" Suzanne grinned at me knowingly, ""You're not one for inactivity, are you, Anne?"" I chuckled, ""Not my preferred state, no."" Determined to take action, I decided to retrieve a train schedule to determine when Guy Pagett's train would be passing through Kimberley. It was scheduled to arrive at 5.",1
"I had no trouble executing my plans. Found a small hotel in a back street, got a room, paid deposit without luggage, and went to bed. Next morning, up early to buy clothes. Waited for the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia to leave with most of the party. Took a tram out of town for a walk. My shoe-lace came untied, a man almost walked into me. Recognized him as the man from the night before. He followed me. Got off tram, he did too. Hailed next tram, he followed. Realized I was up against a gang, led by the ""Colonel"". Manifold activities, strike on the Rand, secret organization at work. ""Colonel"" directed and organized, did not participate directly.",1
"""That's the kind of secret he would have kept from his wife and four children,"" I said, finally breaking the silence. ""Has anyone else heard about this?"" He shifted uncomfortably under my intense gaze. ""Only Miss Beddingfeld. She showed up at Kimberley Station."" I maintained eye contact, trying to read his expression. ""Sir Eustace, I hope you're not too upset by this revelation?"" ""My friend,"" I replied, ""I must confess that you've truly messed things up!"" I left feeling quite agitated. On my way, I couldn't resist the urge to stop by the corner curio-shop. The owner greeted me warmly, eager to assist.",1
"“Listen, my child, can you hear me as I lay out a few things for you?” “Of course.” “Your father, a great man, will be remembered by history. But he was no businessman.” I was well aware of that fact, maybe even more so than Mr. Flemming, but I held my tongue. He went on: “You likely don’t grasp these matters. Let me clarify.” He went into unnecessary detail. The end result was that I was left to navigate life with only £87, 17s. 4d. It felt disappointingly insufficient. Anxiously, I braced myself for what would come next.",1
"In the dead of night, the thief made a swift escape under the cover of darkness. Lord Yardly promptly dispatched a footman to summon the police, while Lady Yardly, aided by Poirot, recounted her harrowing ordeal. ""I was about to switch on the lamp,"" she recounted shakily, ""when a man pounced on me from behind. He ripped my necklace off with such violence that I tumbled to the ground. In that moment, I caught a glimpse of him vanishing through the side entrance.""",1
"I gasped in horror at the sight of the airplane dagger. Maître Grosíer immediately interjected, insisting on speaking to his client before any questions were answered. Jack Renauld, however, disregarded Grosíer's pleas and calmly confirmed, ""Yes, I recognize it. It was a gift from me to my mother, a reminder of the War."" When asked about the possibility of a duplicate dagger, Jack confidently stated, ""To my knowledge, there is none. The design was unique to me."" The magistrate was taken aback by the audacity of Jack's response.",1
"""As we returned to the flat, Poirot's expression changed. He leaned in and whispered, 'A man of method is at play here.' I couldn't help but ask, 'The murderer, or Count Foscatini?' Poirot's response was cryptic, 'The latter was certainly meticulous. Even in his plea for help and prediction of his demise, he made sure to delicately place the telephone receiver back in its cradle.' His words sparked a realization in me, 'You suspect poison?' I gasped. Poirot's smile was enigmatic. We entered the flat to find the local inspector and two constables waiting for us.""",1
"""I never trusted you,"" she said sharply. ""It's not that simple,"" he replied. ""I had grown cynical and suspicious, always searching for hidden agendas. Your care and concern felt like a breath of fresh air."" As he spoke, she couldn't help but notice inconsistencies in his story - promises of money, talk of buying back stolen diamonds, and a deliberate distance in his descriptions of the men involved. And then she realized, when he said ""my friend,"" he wasn't referring to Eardsley, but to Lucas. It was Lucas, the unassuming one, who had been in love with Nadina all along.",1
"""Shall we go down together, Hastings, and lend an ear to our guest's particular issue? Please extend my apologies."" Roger Havering, a man in his forties, stood tall with a sharp appearance, yet his face betrayed signs of distress. ""Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s associate, correct? It is absolutely crucial that he accompany me to Derbyshire today."" ""I'm sorry, but that's not feasible,"" I responded. ""Poirot is bedridden with the flu."" Havering's expression darkened. ""Oh dear, that is a significant setback for me.""",1
"""Did you notice Sir Eustace?"" I inquired. ""He stormed out of the dining area as we entered. He seemed to have eaten some spoiled fish and was expressing his dissatisfaction to the head waiter, even going so far as to bounce a peach on the ground to demonstrate its hardness, though it turned out to be softer than he anticipated and ended up getting squashed."" Suzanne grinned. ""Sir Eustace is not a fan of early mornings, much like myself. But, Anne, did you catch sight of Mr. Pagett? I bumped into him in the hallway. He had a bruised eye. What on earth could have happened to him?"" ""Perhaps he was attempting to push me into the water,"" I responded nonchalantly. It was a small victory for me.",1
"“After receiving the devastating news from his friend, the nephew tragically took his own life. Despite Mr. Bleibner's lack of a will, his fortune would ultimately be inherited by his nephew and then passed on to the doctor.” “As for Mr. Schneider, his involvement remains uncertain. Considering his acquaintance with young Bleibner, he may have had suspicions. Alternatively, the doctor could have orchestrated another death to further fuel superstitious beliefs. Additionally, I must share an intriguing psychological insight, Hastings. A murderer often feels compelled to reenact their crime, becoming increasingly consumed by the act itself.",1
"""Did he have any issues at home? Was the husband and wife getting along?” “His family life seemed peaceful and routine. Mrs. Davenheim was a nice, but not very bright woman. A bit of a nobody, really.” “So, we can rule out any problems there. What about enemies?” “He had a lot of business competitors, and probably some people he outsmarted who didn't like him. But no one with a motive to harm him, and if they did, where's the body?” “Right.""",1
"""But at what point did their 'strategy' falter?"" ""My friend, the idea of posing as a maid or butler is sound, but one must not neglect their duties. They overlooked a room in need of dusting; hence, when the man placed the jewel-case on the small table by the connecting door, it left a distinct mark."" ""I recall that moment,"" I exclaimed. ""Everything became clear."" A brief pause followed. ""And I have my pearls,"" Mrs. Opalsen added, like a chorus in a play. ""Well then,"" I remarked, ""it's time for dinner."" Poirot walked beside me. ""This success should boost your reputation,"" I commented.",1
"A large settee covered in chintz was positioned against the far wall, while the window seats were also draped in the same faded fabric. Poirot, cigarette in hand, emphasized the need to meticulously search the room for clues, particularly in the desk. The key to the desk, labeled in a messy handwriting, raised suspicions. After questioning the Bakers, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen from Plymouth to create a hidden compartment in the fireplace. Coghan, one of the workers, disclosed the intricate details of the job. Excitedly, Poirot and I returned to explore the hidden cavity.",1
"""Indeed,"" I replied with a heavy heart. ""I hold myself responsible for the tragic turn of events. My companion was deeply disturbed by what she witnessed, almost fainting on the spot. I provided her with brandy and water, then escorted her safely back to town. Unfortunately, in my haste, I neglected to secure the door until my return to the Villa."" The commissary interjected, ""So, for a minimum of twenty minutes..."" I nodded in agreement, ""Precisely, twenty minutes,"" confirming his observation. M. Hautet chimed in, his tone once again stern, ""This situation is truly lamentable, unprecedented."" Suddenly, a new voice entered the conversation, ""You express regret, M.",1
"“I love you? How is that possible, given everything you know about me?” “I'm not sure,” I replied, feeling a sense of exhaustion wash over me. “Love is a force beyond control. I've attempted to resist it from the moment we first crossed paths. But love, it seems, is more powerful than my will.” Unexpectedly, she collapsed to the ground once more, consumed by uncontrollable sobs. “I can't go on like this!” she wailed. “I'm lost, with no direction. Please, someone, have mercy on me and show me the way!” Once again, I knelt beside her, offering what comfort I could muster.",1
"However, the conversation shifted when the topic of jewels arose. Mrs. Blair and Miss Beddingfeld both turned to Colonel Race with excitement, exclaiming ""Diamonds!"" in unison. They bombarded Race with questions about his experiences in Kimberley, eager to learn more about the mines and the treatment of the native workers. Despite my own visit to Kimberley, I found myself unable to join in the conversation as Race expertly fielded their inquiries.",1
"""Perhaps it would have been wiser for her not to have written it, but I refrained from mentioning it at the time. You followed her instructions, visited the curio shop, were led through a hidden passage from the rear room, and found yourself in the clutches of your foes!"" Harry glanced at me. I caught his meaning and moved closer to Sir Eustace. ""Indeed,"" Sir Eustace muttered, ""you are certainly not having much luck! This is, let me think, the third encounter."" ""You are correct,"" Harry agreed. ""This marks the third encounter. You have defeated me twice. Have you not heard that luck changes on the third try? This is my move, Anne."" I was prepared. In an instant, I pulled the pistol from my stocking and aimed it at his head. The two men guarding Harry lunged forward, but his voice halted them. ""Take another step and he will not survive! If they come any closer, Anne, pull the trigger without hesitation."" ""I will,"" I responded cheerfully. ""I am somewhat apprehensive about pulling it, in any case."" I believe Sir Eustace shared my apprehension. He was visibly trembling. ""Stay where you are,"" he ordered, and the men complied. ""Instruct them to exit the room,"" Harry instructed. Sir Eustace complied. The men departed, and Harry locked the door behind them. ""Now we can converse,"" he remarked grimly, crossing the room to retrieve the revolver from my hand. Sir Eustace breathed a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. ""I am woefully out of shape,"" he commented. ""I suspect I have a weak heart. I am relieved that the revolver is in capable hands. I did not trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can converse. I am willing to acknowledge that you outsmarted me. Where in the world did that revolver come from? I had the girl's belongings searched upon her arrival. And now where did you produce it from? You did not have it on you a moment ago?"" ""Yes, I did,"" I responded. ""It was in my stocking."" ""I am ignorant about women. I should have studied them more,"" Sir Eustace lamented. ""I wonder if Pagett would have known?"" Harry rapped sharply on the table. ""Cease the foolishness. If not for your gray hair, I would toss you out the window. You despicable scoundrel! Gray hair or not, I..."" He took a few steps forward, causing Sir Eustace to dart behind the table. ""The young are always so violent,"" Sir Eustace reproached. ""Incapable of employing their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us speak sensibly. Currently, you hold the upper hand. However, this situation cannot persist. My men are scattered throughout the house. You are vastly outnumbered. Your temporary dominance was a fluke."" ""Was it?"" There was something in Harry's tone, a harsh mockery, that captured Sir Eustace's attention. He gazed at him. ""Was it?"" Harry repeated. ""Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say."" While keeping him under the gun, he continued, ""The odds are against you this time. To begin with, listen to that!"" A muffled pounding at the door below could be heard. There were cries, curses, and then gunshots. Sir Eustace turned pale. ""What is that?"" ""Race and his associates. Did you not realize, Sir Eustace, that Anne and I had an agreement to confirm the authenticity of our communications? Telegrams were to be signed 'Andy,' letters were to have the word 'and' crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew your telegram was a forgery. She willingly walked into the trap here, hoping to catch you in your own snare. Before departing Kimberley, she sent telegrams to both Race and me. Mrs. Blair has been in contact with us since then. I received the letter composed at your direction, which was precisely what I predicted. I had already discussed with Race the likelihood of a concealed passage leading out of the curio shop, and he had pinpointed the location of the exit."" There was a loud ripping sound, followed by a deafening explosion that shook the room. ""They are bombarding this area. I must get you out of here, Anne."" A brilliant light illuminated the room as the building across the street caught fire. Sir Eustace paced back and forth anxiously. Harry kept him in his sights with the revolver. ""Now you see, Sir Eustace, the game is over. You, in your kindness, provided us with the clue to your whereabouts. Race's men were monitoring the exit of the secret passage. Despite the precautions you took, they managed to follow me here."" Sir Eustace suddenly turned. ""Very clever. Quite commendable. But I have one last thing to say. If I have lost this round, so have you. You will never be able to pin Nadina's murder on me. I was in Marlow that day, that is the only evidence against me. No one can prove I even knew the woman. But you did, you had a motive to kill her, and your past speaks against you. You are a thief, remember, a thief. Perhaps you are unaware of one thing. I possess the diamonds. And watch this."" With a swift motion, he stooped, raised his arm, and hurled something. There was a sound of glass shattering as the object flew through the window and disappeared into the burning structure across the way. ""There goes your sole chance of proving your innocence in the Kimberley incident. And now, let us negotiate. I am cornered. Race will find all the evidence he needs in this house. If I can escape, I have a shot at survival. But if I remain, I am finished, and so are you, young man! There is a skylight in the adjacent room. Give me a couple of minutes' head start, and I will be fine. I have made a few arrangements in advance. Let me out that way, and grant me a lead, and I will leave you a signed confession stating that I murdered Nadina."" ""Yes, Harry,"" I exclaimed. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" He turned a stern gaze upon me.",1
"""Mrs. Blair complimented, tilting her head. ""Share your story, Gipsy girl. What's your reason for heading to South Africa?"" I mentioned Papa's mission. ""So you're Charles Beddingfeld's daughter? You're not just an ordinary Miss, are you? Off to Broken Hill to dig up more skeletons?"" ""Possibly,"" I replied carefully. ""I have other plans too."" ""You're quite the enigmatic one. But you seem exhausted this morning. Did you not rest well? I can never stay awake on a ship. They say ten hours of sleep is for fools! I could use twenty!"" She yawned, resembling a drowsy kitten.",1
"With the ability to feign emotions, she mirrors her mother's cold, calculating nature. It's unclear if she truly believed in her control over the boy's feelings. Though she charmed him, the boy could easily be pulled away by his father. However, with Mr. Renauld's demise and Jack inheriting a large portion of his fortune, the marriage becomes imminent. In a single move, she will secure wealth far beyond the meager sums she has managed to obtain thus far. Her sharp mind grasps the straightforwardness of the situation. It all seems effortless.",1
"“To uncover the truth behind his patient's demise, but a hemorrhage appears to be the likely cause. However, we must conduct further investigations. Get your bag ready in five minutes, Hastings, and we'll catch a taxi to Liverpool Street.” After an hour, we stepped off a train from the Great Eastern at the small Marsdon Leigh station. Gathering information there revealed that Marsdon Manor was approximately a mile away. Choosing to walk, Poirot and I proceeded down the main street. ""What's our strategy?"" I inquired.",1
"I couldn't fathom why a conspirator would choose to represent thirteen in such an indirect way in real life. If the intention was to convey thirteen, why not simply write ""13""? The spacing between the digits was deliberate. So, I subtracted twenty-two from one hundred and seventy-one, arriving at one hundred and fifty-nine. After repeating the calculation, the result was a hundred and forty-nine. These mathematical exercises, while beneficial for sharpening the mind, proved fruitless in unraveling the mystery at hand. Setting aside arithmetic, I turned my attention to the words inscribed: Kilmorden Castle.",1
"""Poirot was the one to reveal the shocking truth to Jack Renauld, causing a tumultuous reaction. With his mother's support, Jack faced the reality of his father's criminal past. Poirot assured Jack that the truth would remain hidden from the world. Eventually, Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and secretary. Poirot encouraged Jack to seek out the woman who loved him unconditionally, despite his father's history. Meanwhile, Captain Hastings contemplated joining the Renaulds on their new adventure. As Poirot and Hastings watched Miss Mary Marvell from the window, they realized she was simply being followed by adoring fans and not involved in any criminal drama.""",1
"He stared at me, a sly smile playing on his lips. ""You've erred, haven't you?"" I shook my head. ""I highly doubt it."" ""You've handed me the incorrect scroll. This one is unexposed."" I exited with all the poise I could gather. It's humbling to recognize one's own foolishness from time to time! But no one enjoys the revelation. As I passed by a prominent shipping company, I abruptly stopped. A stunning replica of the company's ship, labeled ""Kenilworth Castle,"" caught my eye. A reckless notion crossed my mind. Without hesitation, I pushed the door open and stepped inside.",1
"As I turned around, a voice startled me: “Apologies, Miss Beddingfeld, but I am heading towards the station. Would you and Mrs. Blair like a ride?” “Oh, I appreciate the offer,” I responded quickly. “But it's really not necessary, I” “No trouble at all, I insist. Porter, please load the luggage.” Feeling trapped, I could have argued further, but Suzanne's subtle gesture cautioned me to stay alert. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I replied coolly. We all piled into the car. Racing towards town, I struggled to find conversation. Finally, Pagett broke the silence. “I've found a competent secretary for Sir Eustace,” he mentioned.",1
"But Pagett was already on the warpath. He insisted on recounting a tedious tale involving a roll of films and a reckless bet placed on the Kilmorden. The incident, which took place late at night, saw a steward foolishly tossing the films through a porthole. Disliking such pranks, I expressed my disapproval to Pagett, only to have him repeat the story in his usual inept manner. It took me a while to piece together the jumbled narrative. Our paths did not cross again until lunch, when he burst in with an air of excitement reminiscent of a bloodhound. Bloodhounds were never to my liking.",1
"“Do you recognize me?” Poirot asked with a smile. “Of course. I see your face in the newspapers. How could I not know you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I need your help urgently. This matter requires absolute secrecy.” “You have my word,” declared Poirot grandly. “It involves the Prime Minister. We are in serious trouble.” “We are in a difficult situation,” added Mr. Dodge. “Is the injury severe?” I inquired. “What injury?” “The gunshot wound.” “That is old news,” dismissed Mr. Dodge. “As my friend mentioned earlier, that incident is in the past. Unfortunately, there has been a second attempt,” Lord Estair revealed. “A second attempt? What happened?” “Yes, a different kind of attempt. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has been kidnapped.” “What?” “He was taken!” “Impossible!” I exclaimed. Poirot shot me a warning look. “Sadly, it is true,” Lord Estair confirmed. Poirot turned to Mr. Dodge. “You mentioned the importance of time. What did you mean by that?” After exchanging glances, Lord Estair explained, “There is an Allied Conference approaching. The date is known in diplomatic circles, but the details have been kept secret. The Conference is scheduled for tomorrow evening at Versailles. The Prime Minister's presence is crucial. His absence could lead to disastrous consequences. We have no replacement for him. Only he can represent England.” Poirot’s expression turned grave. “So, the kidnapping was an attempt to prevent his attendance at the Conference?” “That is correct. He was on his way to France at the time.” “And the Conference is still scheduled to take place?” “Tomorrow night at nine o’clock.” Poirot checked his watch. “It is now a quarter to nine.” “Twenty-four hours,” Mr. Dodge remarked. “And a quarter,” Poirot added. “Let us not forget the quarter. Now, about the abduction, did it happen in England or France?” “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed over this morning. He was supposed to spend the night with the Commander-in-Chief before heading to Paris tomorrow. He was escorted across the Channel by a destroyer. Upon arrival in Boulogne, he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.” “Go on.” “They left Boulogne but never reached their destination.” “What happened?” “The car and its occupants were found in a side road, tied up and silenced. The fake car and A.D.C. are still at large.” Poirot looked frustrated. “Incredible! How could they have gone unnoticed for so long?” “We thought the same. The authorities are searching diligently. But there has been no progress. It is baffling, but there have been no leads.” Just then, a young officer entered with a sealed envelope for Lord Estair. After reading it, Lord Estair shared, “They have located the second car and the secretary, Daniels, who was unconscious and tied up. The police believe his account to be genuine.” “Have they found anything else?” “No.” “No sign of the Prime Minister’s body. There is hope. But it is strange. After attempting to shoot him, why go through the trouble of keeping him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “Their goal is to prevent his presence at the Conference at all costs.” “If it is possible, the Prime Minister will be there. Let’s hope it’s not too late. Now, tell me everything from the beginning. I need to know about the shooting incident as well,” Poirot requested.",1
"Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.” “Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. Maman will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “Mon ami,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she is beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned. “Mon Dieu! But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when ” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.” “You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then ” “Eh bien?” “Well, we are hunting together again, and ” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, mon ami, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. Sacré! if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture and in connection with some case. I rather fancy ” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!” We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation. Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, la pauvre dame! She will eat nothing but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, par exemple, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack ma foi! they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M.",1
"The Flemmings observed the Daily Budget, which was experiencing a day that resonated deeply with its essence. SHOCKING CONTINUATION OF SUBWAY TRAGEDY. FEMALE DISCOVERED FATALLY WOUNDED IN SECLUDED RESIDENCE. My eyes devoured the words. ""An astounding revelation unfolded at the Mill House, Marlow yesterday. This very Mill House, belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is available for rent without furnishings, and a prospectus for touring the premises was discovered on the person initially presumed to have taken his own life by throwing himself onto the electrified track at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station.""",1
"""Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.” Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: “We thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson she’s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too came hurrying down the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said. ‘But it’s no good. It’s already let.’ That seemed to finish it, but well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium.A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.” I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied. “So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly. “And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s have your deductions, Hastings.” “‘Obvious, my dear Watson,’” I quoted lightly. “She went to the wrong flat.” “Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” cried Mrs. Robinson admiringly. I rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities. The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities. “A curious story,” he said thoughtfully. “Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll.",1
"“Only stopping by for a brief visit, but it caught my interest. A minor detail, yet I thought it was worth looking into.” Poirot raised an eyebrow. M. Hautet agreed, with a hint of disappointment. “We have to accept the truth, I'm afraid. Giraud, uncouth as he may be, is undeniably clever! Slim chance of him slipping up.” “You don't believe so, M. le juge?” The magistrate simply shrugged. “Well, to be honest, between us, it's clear. Can you see it any other way?”",1
"Poirot spent only a brief moment at each stop, yet his confidence seemed to grow with each one. He exchanged a few words with Norman, who pointed towards a side road saying, ""They are waiting by the bridge if you go left."" As we veered off onto the side road, I noticed a second car parked along the roadside in the dwindling light. Two men in civilian clothing sat inside. Poirot stepped out and conversed with them briefly before we set off towards the north, with the other car trailing closely behind.",1
"""Of course,"" I muttered weakly. ""You won't breathe a word to anyone about me coming along."" ""Certainly,"" I repeated. Despite my hesitation, having this man by my side might be for the best, though a sense of foreboding lingered. Just as I believed I had found peace! I halted my guest as he made to leave. ""It might be wise to know the name of my new assistant,"" I remarked dryly. He paused, then responded, ""Harry Rayburn suits just fine."" An odd choice of words. ""Agreed,"" I conceded for the third time.",1
"""The dagger is missing!"" ""What do you mean missing?"" ""Gone. Poof. The glass jar holding it is now empty."" ""No way,"" I exclaimed. ""I swear I saw it this morning."" My words fell silent. All eyes in the room turned to me. ""What's this about seeing it this morning?"" demanded the officer. ""Yes, this morning,"" I confirmed. ""An hour and a half ago, to be exact."" ""So you went to the shed? How did you get the key?"" ""I got it from the sergeant,"" I admitted. ""And why did you go there?"" I hesitated, then confessed. ""M.",1
"""Who would want to work on a ship anyway? Sure, I promised my publishers my 'Reminiscences' by summer, but who really cares? Only old ladies in the suburbs read that stuff. My so-called famous encounters are nothing special. With Pagett's help, I fabricate dull stories about them. But Pagett is too ethical. He refuses to let me make up tales about people I never actually met. I tried being nice. 'You still look like a wreck, my friend,' I joked. 'You need some sun in a deck-chair. No need to say more.""",1
"I had been waiting for this moment. I was cautious, resisting the urge to react impulsively. Slowly, I succumbed to the pressure and coercion. Under Sir Eustace's guidance, I penned a letter: Dearest Harry, there is a glimmer of hope to prove your innocence unequivocally. Follow my directives precisely. Visit Agrasato's antique store. Request to view something ""uncommon,"" ""for a special event."" The proprietor will invite you to the ""rear chamber."" Accompany him. A messenger will be waiting to escort you to me. Obey his every command. Remember to bring the diamonds along.",1
"I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained. I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett was too tempting to be forborne. ""What do you mean?"" I said. ""Of course I shall wear fancy dress. So will you."" Pagett shuddered. ""So go down to the barber's and see about it,"" I finished. ""I don't think he'll have any out sizes,"" murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye. Without meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive. ""And order a table for six in the saloon,"" I said. ""We'll have the Captain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair"" ""You won't get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,"" Pagett interposed. ""He's asked her to dine with him, I know."" Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. ""Who is Race?"" I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. ""They say he's a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don't know for certain."" ""Isn't that like the Government?"" I exclaimed. ""Here's a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone."" Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice. ""If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started"" ""My dear fellow,"" I interrupted brutally, ""that was a bilious attack. You're always having bilious attacks."" Pagett winced slightly. ""It wasn't the usual sort of bilious attack. This time ""For God's sake, don't go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don't want to hear them."" ""Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!"" ""Ah!"" I said. ""You've been talking to Rayburn."" He did not deny it. ""At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know."" ""By the way, where is the chap?"" I asked. ""I've not set eyes on him since we came on board."" ""He gives out that he's ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace."" Pagett's voice dropped again. ""But that's camouflage, I'm sure. So that he can watch better."" ""Watch?"" ""Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you."" ""You're such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,"" I said. ""I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death's head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty."" That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson's feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn't help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: ""Don't try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.",1
"""“Why did you do it?” The nobleman demanded, his voice filled with confusion. Poirot remained calm as he responded, “I simply wanted to force a resolution.” Lord Yardly was taken aback, exclaiming, “To force a resolution! Dear God!” Poirot continued cheerfully, “And the plan worked, my lord. Therefore, I am pleased to return this to you.” With a grand gesture, he revealed a dazzling diamond. “The prized Star of the East,” Lord Yardly whispered in awe. “But I am at a loss for words.” “No matter,” Poirot replied. “Rest assured, the diamond is safe with you. It was necessary for it to be taken. I promised its protection, and I have upheld my promise.""",1
"Poirot took the lead as we left the town, making our way towards the Villa Geneviève. However, upon reaching the Villa Marguerite, he stopped abruptly. ""I must ensure that Jack Renauld is safe. Hastings, accompany me. Perhaps Mademoiselle should stay outside. Madame Daubreuil's words may be hurtful."" We opened the gate and proceeded up the pathway. Turning the corner of the house, I pointed out a window on the first floor to Poirot. Projected on the blind was the silhouette of Marthe Daubreuil. ""Ah!"" exclaimed Poirot.",1
"""No need to be upset, Anne. I was just joking around. Come sit here. Putting jokes aside, I believe you've stumbled upon something crucial. We've always assumed Pagett had an alibi.

"We were isolated from society, resembling Adam and Eve in solitude but with stark contrasts! Old Batani loitered nearby, observing like a curious dog. I took charge of cooking, despite the challenge with only one functional arm. Harry often roamed outside, while we passed hours together lounging in the palm tree shade, conversing, arguing, touching on all topics imaginable, fighting and reconciling. Our arguments were frequent, yet a genuine and enduring camaraderie developed, beyond what I thought feasible. That, and an unspoken connection.",1
"I reached my destination early the next morning, where I was greeted by a mysterious Dutchman with a short black beard. Without a word, he ushered me into a waiting car and we sped off. In the distance, a strange booming sound echoed through the air, prompting me to inquire about its origin. ""Guns,"" was his curt reply. The realization that there was conflict in Jo'burg sent a thrill through me. Our target, it seemed, lay hidden somewhere in the city's suburbs. With each turn and detour we took, the sound of gunfire grew louder, heightening the tension. Finally, we came to a stop in front of a rundown building.",1
"He was impeccably attired in a deep navy suit, impeccably tailored yet showing signs of wear. His contorted face revealed the agony he must have endured before his untimely demise. A gleaming black dagger protruded from his left side, directly over his heart. To my horror, I realized it was the same weapon I had seen the day before, resting innocently in a glass jar. ""The doctor will be here soon,"" Giraud stated calmly. ""But really, there's no need. It's quite clear how this man met his end. He was stabbed through the heart, a fatal blow that would have killed him instantly."" I inquired about the timing of the murder. ""Was it last night?"" Giraud shook his head. ""No, not likely.""",1

The uncanny resemblance caused a stir among the assembled group, but it soon became apparent that this was a mere boy, untouched by the grey hairs of age, who had entered with an impetuousness that disregarded all norms of decorum.""",1
"He then commanded me abruptly to abandon any notion of marriage. He adamantly refused to approve of such a union. Irritated, I inquired about his objections to Mademoiselle Daubreuil.

"Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",1

Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.” “Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.” “What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.” “And last night?” “I fastened it as usual.” “You are sure of that?” “I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.” “What time would that be?” “The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.” “What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?” “Madame had retired some time before. Denise and Léonie went up with me. Monsieur was still in his study.” “Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?” Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. “What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out ” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “Cette dame? What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.” “Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment.""",1
"She described how he had become involved in various political plots and mentioned certain crucial documents that had been given to him for safekeeping, involving a significant European ""secret"". Madame Beroldy had entrusted him with these papers to mislead those chasing them, but she felt anxious after spotting key figures from the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. Then, on November 28th, disaster struck. The maid who regularly tended to the Beroldys' home discovered the apartment door left ajar, ajar.",1
"""I vehemently deny your accusations,"" I retorted. He flashed a reassuring smile, ""I trust you completely, Miss Redmond. I have never doubted your loyalty. However, there is someone on this ship who has been aware of my secrets from the start. All it takes is one word from him and I am done for. Nonetheless, I am willing to gamble on the chance that he remains silent."" ""And why is that?"" I inquired. ""Because he is a man who prefers to work alone. Once the authorities apprehend me, I will no longer be of any value to him. Perhaps, I might even gain my freedom. Only time will tell."" His laughter was tinged with mockery, yet his expression turned steely.",1
"“30, a man who appeared strikingly similar to him in looks, walked into the hotel and requested the jewel-case from the safe deposit. After signing the receipt, he nonchalantly mentioned, “Looks a bit different from my usual one, but I injured my hand while exiting the taxi.” The clerk, unfazed, commented that he noticed very little change. Rolf chuckled and said, “Well, at least don’t mistake me for a criminal this time. I’ve been receiving threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the irony is I bear a resemblance to a Chinese myself, something about the eyes.” “I scrutinized him,” recounted the clerk to us, “and immediately understood what he meant. The eyes slanted upwards at the corners like those of an Oriental. I had never observed it before.” “By Jove, man,” bellowed Gregory Rolf, leaning in, “do you see it now?” The man gazed at him and flinched. “No, sir,” he replied. “I can’t say that I do.” And indeed, there was nothing remotely Oriental about the sincere brown eyes that met ours. The Scotland Yard detective grunted. “Brazen fellow. Anticipated the eyes might be noticed, and boldly brought it up to dispel suspicion. He must have shadowed you from the hotel, sir, and seized the opportunity as soon as you were out of sight.” “What about the jewel-case?” I inquired. “It was discovered in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing was missing - ‘the Western Star.’” We exchanged bewildered glances; the whole situation felt surreal, almost otherworldly. Poirot sprang to his feet energetically. “I fear I have not been much help,” he lamented. “May I have permission to speak with Madame?” “She’s probably in shock,” Rolf explained. “Then might I have a private conversation with you, sir?” “Of course.” In approximately five minutes, Poirot returned. “Now, my friend,” he said cheerfully. “We must go to the post office. I need to send a telegram.” “To whom?” “Lord Yardly.” He brushed off further questions by linking arms with me. “Come, come, my friend. I understand your thoughts on this wretched affair. I have not excelled! You, in my place, might have excelled! Very well! I acknowledge it. Let us put it behind us and have lunch.” We arrived at Poirot’s residence around four o’clock. A figure stood up from a chair near the window. It was Lord Yardly. He appeared worn out and distressed. “I received your message and rushed over. I have been to Hoffberg, and they deny any knowledge of their man last night, or the telegram. Do you think that” Poirot raised his hand. “My apologies! I sent that telegram, and hired the gentleman in question.” “But why? What for?” The nobleman sputtered helplessly. “My intention was to hasten matters,” Poirot explained calmly. “Hasten matters! Oh, my word!” exclaimed Lord Yardly. “And the plan succeeded,” Poirot said cheerily. “Therefore, my lord, I am pleased to return this to you!” With a grand gesture, he revealed a dazzling object.”",1
"“Did he ever share any fears with you about potential threats?”“Never.”“Did he ever discuss his past in Santiago, or any potential enemies he may have had there?”“No.”“Then you have no useful information to provide?”“I’m afraid not. I fail to see why you are questioning me. Can’t his wife give you the answers you seek?” Her tone carried a subtle hint of sarcasm.“Madame Renauld has already shared all she knows.”“Ah!” exclaimed Madame Daubreuil. “I can’t help but wonder…”“What is it that you wonder, madame?”“Nothing.”The magistrate scrutinized her. He understood that he was engaged in a battle of wits with a formidable opponent.“You are maintaining that M.…”",1
"It was right up on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages and villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. “Mrs. Raffini?” I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me. A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. “So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said.",0
"You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “Eh bien, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d hounds to the hounds.",0
"I had always vaguely associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong that is a lava-lava. At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I can’t help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of bacon-bacon, and then go out clad in a jumper-jumper to pay the books. Suzanne was a little tamer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a lovely view right out over Table Bay. I looked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some special face-cream. When she had found it and started an immediate application, she became capable of listening to me.",0
"""Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony.",0
"And you were right.” I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance. “My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.” “Ended?” “But yes. They are arrested.” “Who are arrested?” “The chambermaid and the valet, parbleu! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?” “You said cabinet-makers used it.” “Certainly they do to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot.",0
"By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a desperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted that I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions and failed!” “What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle.",0
"I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited.",0
"Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well I warned you.",0
"” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil.",0
"""By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why ” I began. “No ‘whys,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.",0
"Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish.",0
"She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.” “By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why ” I began. “No ‘whys,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered. Arrived at the Villa Geneviève, Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But ” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the ” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “Mille tonnerres!” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!” A cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear tones came the words: “No, you don’t! I’ve got you and my wrists are just like steel.” At the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by Françoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door. “It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.” There was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale, beckoned us in. “She is safe?” demanded Poirot. “Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.” Mrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping for breath. “Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong. “A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at the door. Where is the other?” The girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil! ve confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you must have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room her boudoir,” he explained. “But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you why was I not told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child ” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour slightly to my annoyance.",0
"“Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively. We pulled up in front of the station. Here surely he would leave us. I turned with outstretched hand but no. “I’ll come and see you off. It’s just eight o’clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.” He gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train.",0
"Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that all alone. You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.” “Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy.",0
"Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen? Would he have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so providentially upon the scene?” “Then you think he may be entirely innocent?” “It looks like it, but, if so, we’ve got to find out what he was doing in Marlow. If he’s got a reasonable explanation of that, we’re on the right tack.” He got up. “It’s past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before dawn I’ll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at Livingstone. I’ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away until the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira train there.",0
"""Of course,” began Giraud, “I soon saw through all that Chilian tomfoolery. Two men were in it but they were not mysterious foreigners! All that was a blind.” “Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “Especially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.” Giraud glared, but continued: “A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the grave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there was a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld’s quarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The motive was established.",0
"And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. Maman will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “Mon ami,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she is beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned.",0
"No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He’s not to leave the house without orders.” He put the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping the table with his hand. “May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,” I said, after a minute or two of silence. “Certainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.",0
I felt my temper stirred. “Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.” “Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his pocket. A lot of other people may have had too only they didn’t happen to be killed.” I rallied my forces. “You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?” “Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.” “And no money.,0
"“I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said, in a low voice. “It’s been in the family so long.” She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her shoulders. “I must go and dress. I suppose I had better display ‘the goods.’” She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. “It’s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George has always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never been done.” She left the room. Half an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady.",0
"He has only just recovered.” “Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw ruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.” Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past.",0
"“Yes, I do feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.",0
"“How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered. “But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.",0
"In the pitch darkness of the night, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned reluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police. Lady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a woman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story. “I was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a man sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with such force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him disappearing through the side door.",0
"” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him.",0
"It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer.",0
"” I shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed. “But console yourself, mon ami,” said Poirot, calming down. “All cannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.” “You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever knew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance. “What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share that opinion even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “Without doubt. She is coming here.” “How do you make that out?” “Very simply.",0
"He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied. “My cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir larger.” “I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed. He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17.",0
"Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.” About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street. “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked. “First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.” The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell. We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner. Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind. “Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?” “You consider him a rich man, doctor?” The doctor looked rather surprised. “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.” “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly. The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly. “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.” “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?” “My dear sir, I never attended him.” “What?” “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist or something of that kind.” “But you examined the body?” “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.” “And the cause of death was clear?” “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.” “Was he still lying where he had been found?” “Yes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.” “No question of his having been shot, eh?” “My dear sir!” “I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!” “You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,” said Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing further” We took the hint. “Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?” “Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.” And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces. “And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor. “Rather an old ass.” “Exactly. Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.” I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly: “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!” I looked at him coldly. On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold. “Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered. “Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy.” Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth. “It is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? But must I be bothered now so soon?” “Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the Company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have empowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you. Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?” “I was changing for tea when my maid came up one of the gardeners had just run to the house. He had found” Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically. “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?” “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.” “Shooting rooks, eh?” “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.” “Where is this little rook rifle now?” “In the hall, I think.” She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.",0
"There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells. I will impart it to you ” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, ne vous impatientez pas! I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology.",0
"30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!” “Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?” Japp winked. “I think it grew pretty fast grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that we’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I’m sorry Mrs.",0
"The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the Kilmorden seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr.",0
"What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real. Just at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would not have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. With a short laugh he released me. “What’s your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet.",0
"My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation.",0
"“A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things. That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly ” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.” “You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile. “But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping.” “Who is that?” “Madame Daubreuil,” said the detective dryly. “Eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have heard about that, have you?” “I hear everything,” said Giraud imperturbably. “There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,” said M.",0
"""Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, petite, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound.",0
"I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind.",0
"Only one thing had been taken ‘the Western Star.’” We stared at each other the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal. Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?” “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf. “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?” “Certainly.” In about five minutes Poirot reappeared. “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.” “Who to?” “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine.",0
"“I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.",0
"” Poirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked than ever. “So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil murdered M. Renauld?” “Yes.” “Why?” He shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback. “Why?” I stammered. “Why? Oh, because ” I came to a stop. Poirot nodded his head at me. “You see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame Daubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld? We can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death; considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You cannot have a murder without a motive.",0
"I myself had been the first sufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head muffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions. His eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece. “Yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “Once more shall I be myself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers! Figure to yourself, mon ami, that I have a little paragraph to myself in Society Gossip.",0
"“I am investigating the death of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?” She bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can er throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned to her. “Marthe, dear ” But the girl shook her head. “No, maman, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.",0
"The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal blood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination. It was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy’s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the outskirts of Lyons.",0
"They could hardly have been hidden on board and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the Olympia’s arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the Olympia got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.” “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?” “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.” “But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked Poirot gently. “Yes.” The young man stared at him in a puzzled manner. “You do not catch my meaning, I see,” said Poirot, smiling enigmatically. “Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank.” Ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it. “Send this in and my uncle will see you at once.” Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the London and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven. “I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr. Vavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.” “I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs’s?” “I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.” “And no clerk has had access to them?” Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago in fact on the very day that Philip left us. He has only just recovered.” “Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw ruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.” Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out. “I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street. “You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.” “It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, mon ami.",0
"He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter. “Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called ‘book knowledge.",0
"Pagett is staying behind here you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia which is very annoying, because I want to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural.",0
"“Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?” “You wouldn’t like it if they did,” I assured her. “To tell you the truth, I’m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as I was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.” Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. “And what are we all doing now?” she asked. “I don’t quite know,” I said thoughtfully.",0
"Monsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a stout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his charming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in which Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although doing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The Beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with. But unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of Romance.",0
"It might just as easily have been a grey hair and then, by no conceivable effort could Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack Renauld! But it is all of a piece.",0
"They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: “But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear now?” And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. “I am afraid for you.",0
"The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a halt by my chair. “Feeling better this morning?” I thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being. “You did look ill yesterday. Colonel Race and I decided that we should have the excitement of a funeral at sea but you’ve disappointed us.” I laughed. “Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered. “I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.” “About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are but I’ve got another roll.” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly.",0
"All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then.",0
"She was middle-aged, and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call “une maitresse femme.” She greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head. “Pray be seated, monsieurs.” We took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a round table. “I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night?” “Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly assassins are to be caught and punished.",0
"What frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us some one he recognized.” “You didn’t see any one?” “No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.” “Nothing unusual in that,” said the inspector dryly. “But he wasn’t a doctor.” “What?” “He wasn’t a doctor,” I repeated. “How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?” “It’s difficult to say, exactly. I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies.",0
"There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending over him. “Did you hit him again?” I called breathlessly. “There was no need,” he replied grimly. “I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands. Rayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation.",0
"I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air. “Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “Parbleu! to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me.",0
"It was already a few minutes past the dinner hour. Suddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed in the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress. Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there with one hand just touching the necklace. “Behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to have vanished. “Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.” The switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened.",0
"I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.” “There has been a second attempt, then?” “Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has disappeared.” “What?” “He has been kidnapped!” “Impossible!” I cried, stupefied. Poirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut. “Unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,” continued his lordship. Poirot looked at Mr. Dodge. “You said just now, monsieur, that time was everything.",0
"""I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure,” replied the young soldier; “but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my people’s, I didn’t know him very well myself.” “You came down when?” “Tuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock. But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.” “You were returning to East Africa, I understand?” “Yes. I’ve been out there ever since the War a great country.” “Exactly.",0
"On we went, through Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford. I began to see our objective. Through Windsor and on to Ascot. My heart gave a leap. Ascot was where Daniels had an aunt living. We were after him, then, not O’Murphy. We duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. Poirot jumped out and rang the bell. I saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face. Plainly, he was not satisfied. The bell was answered. He was ushered inside. In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into the car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to die down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence incriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were holding the Prime Minister? Our return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We deviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally stopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital. Poirot only spent a few minutes at each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored. He whispered something to Norman, to which the latter replied: “Yes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by the bridge.” We turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a second car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men in plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we started off in a northerly direction, the other car following close behind. We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds. Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke. “I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.” The girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall. “Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.” But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and poured into the house, shutting the door behind them. Norman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity. Finally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three prisoners a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were taken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by Poirot himself. “I must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this gentleman. You do not know him, no? Eh bien, let me present to you, Monsieur O’Murphy!” O’Murphy! I gaped at him open-mouthed as we started again. He was not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He sat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman and I would be more than a match for him. To my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not returning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the car slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon Aerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirot’s idea. He proposed to reach France by aeroplane. It was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A telegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave the personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others. As we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man took his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly. I, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm. “I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late if you go yourself.” Poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two. “Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram.” At that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the Flying Corps. “This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France. He can start at once.” “Wrap up warmly, sir,” said the young pilot. “I can lend you a coat, if you like.” Poirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself: “Yes, there is time just time.” Then he looked up, and bowed politely to the young officer. “I thank you, monsieur. But it is not I who am your passenger. It is this gentleman here.” He moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out of the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of surprise. It was the Prime Minister! “For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?” “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.” “What?” “I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face” “But by whom?” “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.” “Impossible!” “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character.",0
"Oh, you English! With nous autres it is different. Figure to yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war fled to Ostend. There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves. Impossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a horror mais une horreur! of the sea! What was she to do? Daily les Boches were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible situation!” “What did she do?” I inquired curiously. “Fortunately her husband was homme pratique. He was also very calm, the crises of the nerves, they affected him not.",0
"The black silk handbag which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose change, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of a first-class ticket to London. Nothing much there to go upon. Such were the details published broadcast by the Daily Budget, and “Find the Man in the Brown Suit” was their daily war-cry. On an average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their success in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces cursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown suit.",0
"No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological heredity, mon ami, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?” “About five, I believe.” “That will do very well. We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.",0
"I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. “Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England’s Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention. “In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!” He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a how do you call it? ‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.” I laughed. “At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.” “I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate MacAdam?” “Enfantillage!” replied Poirot promptly. “One can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.” “It was very near succeeding this time,” I reminded him. Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him. “They won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very important.” “Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain. “He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly. “You know me?” Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures.",0
"“I suppose you’ll be there,” I said coldly. “Very possibly. We might travel together.” “I’m not sure that I shan’t stay on at the Falls a bit,” I answered non-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo’burg? He’s got his eye on Anne, I believe. “What are your plans, Miss Anne?” “That depends,” she replied demurely, copying me. “I thought you were my secretary,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. Thursday night. We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds? At last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems that she’s a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs. Blair’s cabin, she must have been reading aloud all her special articles for years to come. It seems that all along she’s been on the track of “The Man in the Brown Suit.” Apparently she didn’t spot him on the Kilmorden_ in fact, she hardly had the chance, but she’s now very busy cabling home: “How I journeyed out with the Murderer,” and inventing highly fictitious stories of “What he said to me,” etc. I know how these things are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me. And of course one of Nasby’s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won’t recognize himself. The girl’s clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she’s ferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house. She was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a deduction quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather that she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have these intuitions I’ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess but to call it a deduction is absurd. How she ever got on the staff of the Daily Budget is more than I can imagine. But she is the kind of young woman who does these things. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into my private car! I am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He might just have got off by Monday’s train. They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that says little. He’s an astute young man and he knows Africa. He’s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman and the simple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a scar, dressed in the height of European fashion. I never did quite swallow that scar. Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track. She wants the glory of discovering him for herself and the Daily Budget. Young women are very cold-blooded nowadays. I hinted to her that it was an unwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she run him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn’t like it, either, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may all be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs. Blair but she seemed quite to welcome the idea, and remarked that if I were murdered it would be really a terrific scoop for Anne! A scoop for Anne indeed! To-morrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland. The dust will be atrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also mealie bowls and baskets. I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may run amok. There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel will appeal to her. Friday evening. As I feared. Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden animals! (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia. There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter. I imitated her example most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out. We talked half the night. It had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted as well as aggressive ones. Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his party, I was fairly safe. Both he and Colonel Race were powerful protectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to stir up a hornet’s nest about my ears. Also, as long as I was near Sir Eustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious “Colonel.” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight. Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head the “Colonel” was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival. I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution. “There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace made his money!” “Suspecting him again?” “Suzanne, I’ve got into that state that I can’t help suspecting somebody! I don’t really suspect him but, after all, he is Pagett’s employer, and he did own the Mill House.” “I’ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn’t anxious to talk about,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean crime it might be tin-tacks or hair restorer!” I agreed ruefully. “I suppose,” said Suzanne doubtfully, “that we’re not barking up the wrong tree? Being led completely astray, I mean, by assuming Pagett’s complicity? Supposing that, after all, he is a perfectly honest man?” I considered that for a minute or two, then I shook my head. “I can’t believe that.” “After all, he has his explanations for everything.” “Y es, but they’re not very convincing. For instance, the night he tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden, he says he followed Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down. Now we know that’s not true.” “No,” said Suzanne unwillingly. “But we only heard the story at second-hand from Sir Eustace. If we’d heard it direct from Pagett himself, it might have been different. You know how people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.” I turned the thing over in my mind. “No,” I said at last, “I don’t see any way out. Pagett’s guilty. You can’t get away from the fact that he tried to throw me overboard, and everything else fits in. Why are you so persistent in this new idea of yours?” “Because of his face?” “His face? But” “Yes, I know what you’re going to say. It’s a sinister face. That’s just it. No man with a face like that could be really sinister. It must be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.” I did not believe much in Suzanne’s argument. I know a lot about Nature in past ages. If she’s got a sense of humour, she doesn’t show it much. Suzanne is just the sort of person who would clothe Nature with all her own attributes. We passed on to discuss our immediate plans. It was clear to me that I must have some kind of standing. I couldn’t go on avoiding explanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay ready to my hand, though I didn’t think of it for some time. The Daily Budget! My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn. He was marked down as “The Man in the Brown Suit” through no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be against him. The “Colonel” and his gang must have no suspicion that there existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I knew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to Lord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer “Nadina” who had been delighting Paris for so long. It seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified already but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw how natural it really was. Nadina had never been to England during her successful career in Paris. She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that it is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand, Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could. All this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne’s full approval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a psychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards). The Daily Budget was hard up for a sensation. My guess was verified and proved to be correct and the Daily Budget had the scoop of its lifetime. “Victim of the Mill House Murder identified by our special reporter.” And so on. “Our reporter makes voyage with the murderer. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ What he is really like.” The main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers, but I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date! I received approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo. I was on the staff of the Daily Budget, and I had a private word of congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that it was he best so for the present. We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail. It had character. It had charm. A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged me or Suzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to the position that I had been the first to behold its beauty. In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this three-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals, all of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat of a problem. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals each and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off. Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape, a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn’t like me. Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy. Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could. And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament.",0
"That is what always happens to me and, after all, this is my private car, not Race’s. Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the beauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her principal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn’t even doing that. Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don’t blame her if so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew she is a repellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman. There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld.",0
"My words startled her still more. “To South Africa? My dear Anne. We would have to look into anything of that kind very carefully.” That was the last thing I wanted. I explained that I had already taken my passage, and that upon arrival I proposed to take up the duties of a parlourmaid. It was the only thing I could think of on the spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to taking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at getting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further query.",0
"“But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.” “Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.” Mr. Chichester did not reply. “Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally. “To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.",0
"I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight. It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that’s extra beautiful. I’m not very good at expressing these things, but I knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment, the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsly.",0
"” We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us. “Japp!” I ejaculated. The Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion. “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.” “My wife” “I’ve seen your good lady, sir and the housekeeper. I won’t keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.” “I know nothing as yet as to what” “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly.",0
"And I hardly noticed the woman. I don’t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up right away, and take another look at her.” But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts. From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.” The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt? I wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s reply was prompt: “Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.” Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required. Taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on the fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention that inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot’s prognostication. No such woman as “Mrs. Middleton” had ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection. “Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.” “It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?” “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “Précisément and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.” “Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.” “And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.",0
"The detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion. “You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about the case. Let’s hear your views.” “One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M. Giraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there nothing it reminds you of?” “Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so, though.” “You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember but I shall do so.",0
"I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue.",0
"Jeanne went to answer it, and returned with a card in her hand. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at the sight of the name on the card, “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a sudden flicker of interest came into her eyes. “I will see him. The maize peignoir, Jeanne, and quickly. And when the Count comes you may go.” “Bien, Madame.” Jeanne brought the peignoir, an exquisite wisp of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to herself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo on the glass of the dressing-table. The Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to him a man of medium height, very slim, very elegant, very pale, extraordinarily weary.",0
"The Flemmings took in the Daily Budget, and the Daily Budget was having a day after its own heart. EXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT. WOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station.",0
"What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong.",0
"The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably deeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and here the words that he used are significant.” “‘Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now,’” I repeated. “They seem to me a little vehement, perhaps, that is all.” “That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why? Not only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.” “Why should it be?” I asked, bewildered. “That is what we ask ourselves.",0
"He seemed lost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme mental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in doubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and turning to Japp, he asked: “Have you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim occupied the same bedroom?” The question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. “Good Lord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something startling.",0
"Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, c’est l’Anglais! Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age.",0
"He was a small thin man, very brown of face, with light blue eyes and a small dark beard. “Just come from abroad,” I deduced. “That’s why his overcoat smells so. He’s come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn’t have a beard. Perhaps a tea-planter.” At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by fear almost panic.",0
"""Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I’m an actress. No not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six tumbling.” “I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled. “Haven’t you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I understand.” “I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now ” “We?” “My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in.",0
"She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness. “Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen’s room.” The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife’s room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered. As she was about to depart Poirot detained her. “One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen a card like this?” He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully. “No, sir, I can’t say I have.",0
"‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was perfect, the indulgent tone, the soupçon of sad mockery. At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great woman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!” Poirot lost himself in contemplation. “One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?” “You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be unrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track.",0
"And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point. “Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There were two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological heredity, mon ami, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?” “About five, I believe.” “That will do very well. We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why?” “To find a possible witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right especially with the help of this.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella. For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch. All is well the sea it will be calm!” In the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on board the boat, secure from Poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I pulled myself together, and attacked the facts dispassionately.",0
"He still seemed to be thinking. “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.” “But the maid did!” “Why do you say that?” “Why,” I stammered, “they were found actually in her mattress.” “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.",0
"""Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can be done is being done but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted theory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path near the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately off the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early on the Monday morning. I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg. A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems pretty clear that she can’t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy in interfering in other people’s affairs.",0
"” We did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot effected a rapid change of clothing. “I go to London to-night,” he explained. “It is imperative.” “What?” “Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!” “You’ll come a cropper one of these days,” I observed, rather disgusted by his vanity. “Do not be enraged, I beg of you, mon ami. I count on you to do me a service of your friendship.” “Of course,” I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness.",0
"""What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see.",0
"“Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. Célestine leaves the room again, and pst! in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer. “Madame arrives, the theft is discovered.",0
"But his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance aside. “Then, that’s all right,” I said hastily. Saturday evening saw us dining at the Grand Metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at Brighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste were something magnificent. “Hein, it is a sight this!” murmured Poirot. “This is the home of the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?” “Supposed to be,” I replied. “But we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred with the Profiteering brush.” Poirot gazed round him placidly. “The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains to crime, instead of to its detection.",0
"It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters was sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon. Having heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his appeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate which, of course, it did. “They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M.",0
"Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?” “Oh, I don’t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I think.” “Thank you.” Poirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “With your permission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told us all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your subconscious self.",0
"""I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said.",0
"The House of Commons is bad enough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight restriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly before leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman with a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle in Alice in Wonderland. He dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy fashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further efforts by ejaculating something that sounded like “Platt Skeet,” uttered fortissimo and in marked contrast to the rest of his delivery.",0
"""And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue a psychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice.",0
"Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.",0
"“But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!” It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids. The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot.",0
"The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.” The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher. The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below. “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.” I craned my neck over the staircase. “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper.",0
"There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.",0
"On the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her “lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. To intimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political intrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. There was also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with herself acting as the go-between. Amongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young lawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating Jeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the young man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her complete devotion to her middle-aged husband.",0
"But I shall be able to tell better when I’ve heard the whole story. Now, then, take a deep breath and start again. You went to Florence” “But I didn’t go to Florence. That is just it.” “Well, where did you go, then?” “I went home to Marlow.” “What the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?” “I wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting” “Your wife? But I didn’t know you were married?” “No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived you in this matter.” “How long have you been married?” “Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I became your secretary.",0
"All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil, subtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing I were the next? “Mon Dieu,” said Poirot, in a very low voice, “I do not understand this. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?” “I believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.” “Ah, of course, you are not the doctor.” “My name is Tosswill.” This, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as being a minor official at the British Museum. There was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy. “If you will come with me,” continued Dr.",0
"My friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful face upon me. “Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier? His system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “Quelle idée! You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.",0
"""But why? What are you waiting for?” “For the Olympia. She is due on her return trip from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.” “To a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, mon ami, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I wait eh bien to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is perfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly gifted by the good God the Inspector McNeil, for instance it would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself.",0
"“I was.” As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. “You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?” “M. Poirot has gone to Paris,” I replied coldly. “And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.” “Bah! The English police!” Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. “They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better.",0
"""What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question.",0
"""Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden.",0
"""Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?” “No, not one.” “Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to tetanus?” “Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.” “Then we have four deaths all totally dissimilar, one heart failure, one blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.",0
"It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look at the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will realize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives. He knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over, vengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me to the real Mrs. Robinson that delightful and truthful creature! What will they think when they find their flat has been broken into! We must hurry back.",0
"I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do.",0
"By the way, you said two minutes and you’ve been three, allowing for interruptions. For a woman, that’s quite remarkable! Must be your scientific training.” I was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been running. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance. I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively.",0
"Suzanne left her face half anointed and pressed for details. I gave them to her. “It all gets more and more mysterious,” she cried. “I thought I was going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that you would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but now I’m not so sure. I hope Pagett won’t push me off the train some dark night.” “I think you’re still above suspicion, Suzanne. But, if the worst happens, I’ll wire to Clarence.” “That reminds me give me a cable form. Let me see now, what shall I say.",0
"The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and the political schemes all the stories current were traced back to the lady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the “Crown jewels” the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his wife.",0
"There are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various aliases. The American Secret Service, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye upon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington. They felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question. One of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face of it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.",0
"He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.",0
"” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled. I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was. “That man? Oh, that’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary. Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before.",0
"” The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt? I wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s reply was prompt: “Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.",0
"""It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?” “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew.",0
"""I mustn’t tell tales out of school.” “Tell us something even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.” “Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit’ having made the voyage with us?” “What?” I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again. Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. “It’s a fact, I believe. Every port watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!” “Not Mr. Pagett?” “Oh, not Pagett the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.” “Have they arrested him?” asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring squeeze. I waited breathlessly for an answer. “He seems to have disappeared into thin air.” “How does Sir Eustace take it?” “Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.” An opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace’s views on the matter presented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne’s sympathetic murmurs. (She does that sort of thing very well.) “First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house on purpose to annoy me, I do believe. Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I’m tired of secretaries, I won’t have any more secretaries. Either they’re concealed murderers or else they’re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have. How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death. I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.",0
"I regret to say that at the first roll the Kilmorden gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a totally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South Kensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office. I smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room. Mrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered. “Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over with you.",0
"” What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance. “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?” Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast. “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I’m with you there, sir.",0
"” Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily. “It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he remarked lugubriously. I don’t see why it should have and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily. Again I believe he is right.",0
"I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so.",0
"” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M.",0
"It demolishes my theory it ruins everything it ah, no!” He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest. “It is impossible. I cannot be wrong! The facts, taken methodically and in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I must be right! I am right!” “But then ” He interrupted me. “Wait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is impossible unless unless oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word ” He was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he said in a quiet assured voice: “The victim is a man of middle-age.",0
"There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter.",0
"See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they were. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.",0
"“If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain.",0
"She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine for all the world as though she’d been running a race and yet Pagett told me that he’d seen her off to Durban last night! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body. And she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, “Secretaries I have had.” No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once. No.",0
"Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you need have no fear for yourself” I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face “you are not threatened. Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr. Milray wishes me to accompany you.",0
"A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way. “There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming genially. “Eh bien, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.” “Bella Duveen.",0
"There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.” “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?” “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.” “And the real Prime Minister?” “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs.",0
"Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur.",0
"Now I knew. They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any price, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs. When you got called to this job, did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed up in it?” “No, but ” “If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the same as I am? Of course you would.” “I’m a man. You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you will show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “Please there’s a dear.” I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again. Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured. “Quick. Water.…” I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. “Take me out of here oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. “That’s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?” I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile.",0
"I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. “All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?” It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it.",0
"As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put me on to a very good thing, and well, I have money to burn, as the saying goes. I think a week-end at the Grand Metropolitan would do us all the good in the world.” “Thank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.” I did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.",0
"In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, mon ami, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go up to the Villa Geneviève.",0
"Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.” “Pardon,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?” “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said.",0
"It is almost impossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not twenty miles from London!” “Perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other,” I suggested. “Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor in the first affair, anyway. But who was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?” “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.” “Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each other. If O’Murphy is an honest man, why did he leave the main road? But if he was a dishonest man, why did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired thereby, in all probability, saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, again, if he was honest, why did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a well-known rendezvous of German spies?” “It looks bad,” I said. “Let us look at the case with method. What have we for and against these two men? Take O’Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels. There is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages for a good Englishman! (Pardon me, mon ami, but, as linguists, you are deplorable!) Now for him, we have the fact that he was found gagged, bound, and chloroformed which does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter.” “He might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.” Poirot shook his head. “The French police would make no mistake of that kind. Besides, once he had attained his object, and the Prime Minister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his remaining behind. His accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now, for, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have been cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.” “Perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?” “Then why did he not do so? He merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing more. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the truth.",0
"He is quite a stranger to me.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure.” “You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?” “No,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. “No, I do not think so. Of course they wore beards false ones the examining magistrate thought, but still no.” Now she seemed to make her mind up definitely. “I am sure neither of the two was this man.” “Very well, madame. That is all, then.” She stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads in her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify the man, in a completely natural manner. Giraud merely grunted.",0
"It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young men with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks. Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things.",0
"Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience.",0
"Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur.",0
"""For the Lord’s sake, tell us, then!” Poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate, placed them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat effect, and then beamed affectionately on us both. “Come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the question which I asked myself. ‘If I were this man, where should I hide?’ Hastings, what do you say?” “Well,” I said, “I’m rather inclined to think I’d not do a bolt at all. I’d stay in London in the heart of things, travel by tubes and buses; ten to one I’d never be recognized.",0
"Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting. “Good,” said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. “I will take these with me for the ‘Colonel’ to see.” “When do you leave?” “Ten o’clock to-morrow morning will do.” “Do you want to see the girl before you go?” “No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the ‘Colonel’ comes. Is she all right?” “I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I think.",0
"In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg.",0
"Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks alias the Rev. Edward Chichester alias Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: “I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me.",0
"Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well it sounds snobbish perhaps but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class.",0
"A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him.",0
"All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly.",0
"She arrived punctually a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour. “My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,” she began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.” “If you please, mademoiselle.” “I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire.",0
"Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle_ that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the devil Carton hid them if he did hide them, I don’t know.",0
"Maltravers? You did not know, I see, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.” “You mean my story suggested to him oh, but that is awful!” “Do not distress yourself it would have been one way or another. Well, I must get on the telephone to London.” Poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back thoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was not till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off no longer, but must break the news to the young widow.",0
"When you got called to this job, did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed up in it?” “No, but ” “If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the same as I am? Of course you would.” “I’m a man. You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you will show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated.",0
"Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate: “I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I hoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback.",0
"A woman nearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may be deceived!” “Billy Kellett? But he’s known to the police!” “Did I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his alibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn he was creating the character of Billy Kellett, ‘doing three months,’ so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came. He was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty. It was worth while doing the thing thoroughly.",0
"… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad.",0
"""What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference.",0
"“Let us in, moosior.” “You have our friends safe and sound?” “Yes, we’ve got the birds all right. But they hadn’t got the goods with them.” “I see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with Hastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat.” “For the Lord’s sake, have you gone completely balmy?” “The cat,” declaimed Poirot, “was worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp. To speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I know, considered polite in England.",0
"I shall label this car not “Sir Eustace Pedler and Party,” but “Colonel Race and Harem.” Then Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every time we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed higher and higher, she snapped at the engine. “You see the point,” she cried delightedly. “It must be some curve if you can photograph the front part of the train from the back, and with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.” I pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly. “I shall write underneath it: ‘Taken from the train.",0
"Giraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said: “That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the interrogatory, M. le juge.” “Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your quarrel?” “I decline to state.” M. Hautet sat up in his chair. “M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered. “What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But another voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I will inform you, if you like, M.",0
"""I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs’s?” “I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.” “And no clerk has had access to them?” Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago in fact on the very day that Philip left us.",0
"I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life. If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13” like that. There was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle.",0
"“There will be no objection to my er calling in this gentleman, I suppose?” “None at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. “Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just let us have the facts?” Mrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her chair. “Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself.” Thus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began. “I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room as usual” “Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mr. Opalsen explained.",0
"And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate.",0
"She presented an extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr. Opalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials stood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An hotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the fire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman, obviously Mrs. Opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands, with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress. Into this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling.",0
"Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me.",0
"” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused. “Go on what next?” “I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links ” Again I paused.",0
"’ That will intrigue him, the good Japp! His eyes will open wide wide! He will not comprehend in the slightest until to-morrow, or the next day!” I remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend’s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank. Before we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and Japp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was Poirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of my friend.",0
"The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the crime passionnel is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.” “But what about the crime passionnel? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head. “If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked men, the ‘secret,’ the papers!” Poirot smiled a little. “Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably. But reflect now on something very curious. It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale if it were all would indeed be plain sailing it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.",0
"All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one. Très bien, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as the Olympia is in, but some one must travel on the Olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery.",0
"He’s leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I see,” I said thoughtfully. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.” I turned the matter over in my mind. “Well,” I said at last, “it’s awkward but it’s safe enough. We’d better do nothing for the present.” Suzanne looked at me with a little smile. “You don’t like doing nothing, do you, Anne?” “Not very much,” I replied honestly. The one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see what time Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I found that it would arrive at 5.",0
"“I? Never! What a game!” He became excited. “Figure to yourself, each hole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged mathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is only one pleasing thing the how do you call them? tee boxes! They, at least, are symmetrical.” I could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to Poirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no malice. Then he asked: “But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?” “Yes, he was a keen golfer.",0
"” Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture. We lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to present itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed maliciously: “Eh bien! And your indiscretions! You recount them not?” I felt myself blushing. “Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance.",0
"I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the tram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying the sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream sodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the hotel. To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from the curator of the Museum.",0
"You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?” “Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.” “We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country.” “Comment? My old friend the Préfet?” Lord Estair shook his head. “One higher than the Préfet. One whose word was once law in Belgium and shall be again! That England has sworn!” Poirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute.",0
"“Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well er I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence.",0
"“You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room.",0
"The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient greffier sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I I told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed.",0
"At last Lady Yardly rose. “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.” She hesitated, her hand outstretched. “Captain Hastings.” “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.” When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.",0
"""Was there no science then in Ancient Egypt?” asked Poirot softly. He did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment. “No, no, do not answer me, but tell me this. What do the native workmen think?” “I guess,” said Dr. Ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads, natives aren’t going to be far behind. I’ll admit that they’re getting what you might call scared but they’ve no cause to be.” “I wonder,” said Poirot non-committally. Sir Guy leant forward. “Surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in oh, but the thing’s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you think that.",0
"He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter. Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about something. “He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost. I thought he was taken ill.” On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the upstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as that of “Mrs. de Castina.” The police surgeon gave it as his opinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours. The Daily Budget had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the Tube had murdered the woman and afterwards committed suicide. However, as the Tube victim was dead at two o’clock, and the woman was alive and well at three o’clock, the only logical conclusion to come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each other, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in the dead man’s pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so often occur in this life. A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown” was returned, and the police (and the Daily Budget_) were left to look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out. The black silk handbag which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose change, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of a first-class ticket to London. Nothing much there to go upon. Such were the details published broadcast by the Daily Budget, and “Find the Man in the Brown Suit” was their daily war-cry. On an average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their success in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces cursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown suit. The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind. Was it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was prejudiced the Tube incident was my own pet mystery but there certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the two fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face evidently an Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me to what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland Yard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of the Mill House case. My request took some time to understand, as I had inadvertently selected the department for lost umbrellas, but eventually I was ushered into a small room and presented to Detective Inspector Meadows. Inspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I considered a peculiarly irritating manner. A satellite, also in plain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner. “Good morning,” I said nervously. “Good morning. Will you take a seat? I understand you’ve something to tell me that you think may be of use to us.” His tone seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the extreme. I felt my temper stirred. “Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.” “Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his pocket. A lot of other people may have had too only they didn’t happen to be killed.” I rallied my forces. “You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?” “Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.” “And no money.” “He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.” “But no notecase.” “Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.” I tried another tack. “You don’t think it’s odd that the doctor never came forward afterwards?” “A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers. He probably forgot all about the accident.” “In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I said sweetly. “Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know fond of mysteries and such-like. But as I’m a busy man” I took the hint and rose. The man in the corner raised a meek voice. “Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?” The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough. “Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don’t be offended. You’ve asked questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.” I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall. “You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?” “Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened. What frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us some one he recognized.” “You didn’t see any one?” “No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.",0
"He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!” I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head.",0
"“I must go up to her at once.” “But no, I tell you. It is better not.” “But Marthe and I ” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s arm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was weeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs.",0
"On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part.",0
"We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your father? A very interesting man on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them.",0
"That’s just the kind of secret he would have a wife and four children. “Have you told this to any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.” I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance. “I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now that you’ve blinking well torn it!” I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in. The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands.",0
"I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.” He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind.",0
"Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.” I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly: “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!” I looked at him coldly. On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress.",0
"""Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment. “Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, cellela!” The old woman tossed her head scornfully. “Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.” “Voilà,” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the truth.” “Not at all,” said the examining magistrate soothingly. “We were surprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were ” he paused delicately. “Eh? It was that without doubt?” “How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was milor anglais trés riche and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one and trés chic for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but ma foi! I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not last night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.” “English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: “‘Yeas yeas butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’” “Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, voilà tout! So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday. A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes. “What is it?” I whispered. He shook his head impatiently, and asked a question: “Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself?” The commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied promptly: “No, Monsieur did not drive himself.” Poirot’s frown deepened. “I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently. “See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.” “Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested. “Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your own. Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a holiday suddenly, at a moment’s notice? Was it that for some reason he wanted him out of the way before we arrived?” Françoise had left the room. The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully on the table. “M. Bex,” he said at length, “here we have directly conflicting testimony. Which are we to believe, Françoise or Denise?” “Denise,” said the commissary decidedly. “It was she who let the visitor in. Françoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a dislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show that Renauld was entangled with another woman.” “Tiens!” cried M. Hautet. “We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “My dearest one:” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid. If you were to stop loving me! But that’s impossible what a silly kid I am always imagining things! But if you did stop loving me, I don’t know what I should do kill myself perhaps! I couldn’t live without you. Sometimes I fancy another woman is coming between us. Let her look out, that’s all and you too! I’d as soon kill you as let her have you! I mean it. “But there, I’m writing high-flown nonsense. You love me, and I love you yes, love you, love you, love you! “Your own adoring “BELLA.” There was no address or date. Poirot handed it back with a grave face. “And the assumption is, M. le juge ?” The examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right. We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically. “My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter ” “In Santiago,” finished the commissary. “I shall cable without delay to the police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s life out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his friendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange if, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.” The commissary looked round for approval. “Excellent,” said Poirot appreciatively. “His wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,” added the magistrate. “You have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All seemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will. Here it is.” Poirot ran through the document. “So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor who is he, by the way?” “M. Renauld’s secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once or twice for a week-end.” “And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise. Simply drawn up, but perfectly legal. Witnessed by the two servants, Denise and Françoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it back. “Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice ” “The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago. Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his amorous intrigues.” “Yes,” said M. Hautet doubtfully. “But it is possibly a little unfair on his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If she were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.” “It may be as you say. Now, M. Poirot, you would without doubt like to visit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been removed, but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available.” “I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.” The commissary rose. “Come with me, monsieurs.” He opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him. Poirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary. “Monsieur.” “Monsieur.” At last they got out into the hall. “That room there, it is the study, hein?” asked Poirot suddenly, nodding towards the door opposite. “Yes. You would like to see it?” He threw the door open as he spoke, and we entered. The room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was small, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike writing desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large leather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a round table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves lined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window there was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains and portière were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward, passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, mon ami! And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief.",0
"I realized that as we went up the stairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming greeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the “good wife and mother” type. She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices. I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. “Well, Henry, why on earth” I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident.",0
"” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot.",0
"You are a man of original views, I know, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me, Monsieur Poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?” Poirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. He seemed to be considering. Finally he said: “Let us not misunderstand each other, Lady Willard. It is not a general question that you are asking me there. It has a personal application, has it not? You are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband?” “That is so,” she admitted. “You want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?” “I want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? Three deaths, Monsieur Poirot each one explicable taken by itself, but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all within a month of the opening of the tomb! It may be mere superstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science. The fact remains three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly afraid. It may not yet be the end.” “For whom do you fear?” “For my son. When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense” “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly. “I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.” I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest. “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.” “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?” “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.",0
"“Miss Beddingfeld, you may not know it, but you are mixed up in a rather dangerous business.” “I gathered as much,” I said. “No, you don’t. You can’t possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave the whole thing alone. It can’t concern you really. Don’t let your curiosity lead you to tamper with other people’s business. No, please don’t get angry again. I’m not speaking of myself. You’ve no idea of what you might come up against these men will stop at nothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you’re in danger look at last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is to persuade them that they’re mistaken.",0
"I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.” “Beira,” I said meditatively. “Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to me.” We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at each other. “Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut. I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours.",0
"I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. Eh bien, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’ I had heard, or read, all these things before.",0
"Opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands, with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress. Into this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling. Immediately, with an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang from her chair towards him. “There now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do. It was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I’ve a feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.” “Calm yourself, I pray of you, madame.” Poirot patted her hand soothingly. “Reassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot will aid you!” Mr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector. “There will be no objection to my er calling in this gentleman, I suppose?” “None at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. “Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just let us have the facts?” Mrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her chair. “Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself.” Thus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began. “I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room as usual” “Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?” Mr. Opalsen explained. “I make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless Célestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room in the morning while Célestine is present, and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise she never enters the room.” “Well, as I was saying,” continued Mrs. Opalsen, “I came up. I went to the drawer here,” she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table “took out my jewel-case and unlocked it. It seemed quite as usual but the pearls were not there!” The inspector had been busy with his notebook. “When had you last seen them?” he asked. “They were there when I went down to dinner.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case.” “Who locked up the jewel-case?” “I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.” She held it up as she spoke. The inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders. “The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the jewel-case?” “I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.” “You didn’t lock the drawer?” “No, I never do. My maid remains in the room till I come up, so there’s no need.” The inspector’s face grew graver. “Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then the maid has not left the room?” Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French.",0
"Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed.” That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I got it all out of him, little by little.",0
"You see I was right.” “It appears so, mon ami,” said Poirot cautiously. “Appearances are deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.” As we hurried in a taxi to the Magnificent, I puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme. “That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.” “Ma foi!” said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse. “One cannot think of everything!” I felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind. “Cheer up,” I said consolingly. “Better luck next time.” At the Magnificent, we were ushered at once into the manager’s office. Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them. Rolf nodded to us as we entered. “We’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it’s almost unbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can’t think.” A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself it’s something about the eyes.” “I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.” “Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?” The man looked up at him and started. “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours. The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.” “What about the jewel-case?” I asked. “It was found in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing had been taken ‘the Western Star.’” We stared at each other the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal. Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?” “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf. “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?” “Certainly.” In about five minutes Poirot reappeared. “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.” “Who to?” “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine. “Come, come, mon ami. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! Bien! All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.” It was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught. “I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that” Poirot held up his hand. “My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.” “You but why? What?” The nobleman spluttered impotently. “My little idea was to bring things to a head,” explained Poirot placidly. “Bring things to a head! Oh, my God!” cried Lord Yardly. “And the ruse succeeded,” said Poirot cheerfully. “Therefore, milord, I have much pleasure in returning you this!” With a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. It was a great diamond. “The Star of the East,” gasped Lord Yardly. “But I don’t understand” “No?” said Poirot. “It makes no matter. Believe me, it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen. I promised you that it should be preserved to you, and I have kept my word. You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What beau temps, is it not? Good day, milord.” And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands. “Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?” “No, mon ami, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.” “How did you get the diamond.” “From Mr. Rolf.” “Rolf?” “Mais oui! The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in Society Gossip, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike bah! they did not exist. There was only one diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, celui-là! “But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled. “For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.” “Lady Yardly?” “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance. But au fond, he is very business-like, ce monsieur! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her.",0
"He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “Eh ma foi! and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle. “You would have had Maître Grosíer’s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on.” “He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he worried me horribly. You see, I couldn’t very well take him into my confidence.",0
"” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered. Arrived at the Villa Geneviève, Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open.",0
"” Poirot nodded. “Then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in the kitchen. You permit that I mount there?” “Oh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you up and introduce you; but I’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s of any use. They’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and they’ll be all lumped together.” Poirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II. “The order was given from the à la carte menu for three,” he explained.",0
"It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion. Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift. Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side. “We’ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it matters. I can get you across. It’s the wrong side for a boattoo many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side for Livingstone.” “I can swim a little farther than that. What’s the danger, Harry?” For I had seen the grim look on his face. “Sharks?” “No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you’re sharp, Anne. Crocs, that’s the trouble.” “Crocodiles?” “Yes, don’t think of them or say your prayers, whichever you feel inclined.” We plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know. The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios. His name was Ned perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me. It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough. Any message that comes genuinely from me will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.” “Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?” “Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’” “Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head in and withdrawing it immediately. I stood up. “And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked demurely. Harry came close to me. “My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring his neck. And as for you” “Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited. “I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!” “What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically. “And doesn’t he change his mind overnight!” (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) As I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn for a quiet life and that’s just the one thing I don’t seem able to have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief of getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of intrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful creature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or two of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl. What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there. I had a dream a terrible dream that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn’t there and her bed hadn’t been slept in.” She looked at me appealingly. “What shall I do, Sir Eustace?” Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially. “What does Race say about it?” Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society. “I can’t find him anywhere.” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.” “Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can be done is being done but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted theory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path near the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately off the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early on the Monday morning. I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg. A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems pretty clear that she can’t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy in interfering in other people’s affairs. If I were this young fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came asking questions about my love affairs. Later. It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear, but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored. The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg.",0
"Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance. “Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the Anzora to Buenos Ayres. “Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday. “Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are ‘Yes, yes but for God’s sake go now.…’” Poirot paused. “There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do not get new light on the matter.” I endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said.",0
"""And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall.",0
"Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.” She shook her head vigorously. “What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile. “A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too. Italian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.” “I shan’t. I like you did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.",0
"I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain.",0
"“M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you.",0
"Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr.",0
"“And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.",0
"The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible. Nobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them. Angrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted. I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot, neat and smiling, sitting beside the bed. “Enfin you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings! Do you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?” I groaned and put a hand to my head. “I must have been dreaming,” I said.",0
"Have you ever seen him before?” Drawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face, Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity. Then she shook her head. “I do not know him.” It seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head. “You are letting her go?” I asked in a low voice. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her head.” “I do not need teaching my business,” said Giraud dryly. “She is under surveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.",0
"Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy. “But it is misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. “Aqua calda certainly ought to be cold water not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair.",0
"What seems odd to me is that Lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Well, after all, if it were found in the neighbourhood, it might be argued that Davenheim himself had dropped it.” “But why remove it from the body at all?” I cried. “There might be a reason for that,” said Japp. “Do you know that just beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and not three minutes’ walk brings you to what do you think? a lime kiln.” “Good heavens!” I cried. “You mean that the lime which destroyed the body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?” “Exactly.” “It seems to me,” I said, “that that explains everything. What a horrible crime!” By common consent we both turned and looked at Poirot. He seemed lost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme mental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in doubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and turning to Japp, he asked: “Have you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim occupied the same bedroom?” The question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. “Good Lord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something startling. As to your question, I’m sure I don’t know.” “You could find out?” asked Poirot with curious persistence. “Oh, certainly if you really want to know.” “Merci, mon ami. I should be obliged if you would make a point of it.” Japp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have forgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and murmuring, “Poor old fellow! War’s been too much for him!” gently withdrew from the room. As Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper, and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend’s voice aroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk and alert. “Que faites-vous là, mon ami?” “I was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of interest in this affair.” “You become methodical at last!” said Poirot approvingly. I concealed my pleasure. “Shall I read them to you?” “By all means.” I cleared my throat. “‘One: All the evidence points to Lowen having been the man who forced the safe. “‘Two: He had a grudge against Davenheim. “‘Three: He lied in his first statement that he had never left the study. “‘Four: If you accept Billy Kellett’s story as true, Lowen is unmistakably implicated.’” I paused. “Well?” I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on all the vital facts. Poirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “Mon pauvre ami! But it is that you have not the gift! The important detail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.” “How?” “Let me take your four points. “One: Mr.",0
"On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer.",0
"” Mr. Chichester did not reply. “Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally. “To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.” “I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely it. Too much so perhaps. Was he or was he not just a little like a stage clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly. Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A a fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy. “But it is misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. “Aqua calda certainly ought to be cold water not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair. “They’re so obliging though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them the way somewhere, and instead of saying ‘first to the right, second to the left’ or something that one could follow, they pour out a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered they take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with you.” “Is that your experience in Florence, Pagett?” asked Sir Eustace, turning with a smile to his secretary.",0
"""Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions. All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly. Pagett is staying behind here you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia which is very annoying, because I want to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted. “I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious.",0
"""Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.",0
"He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her.",0
"” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order. “Of course, if it’s already taken” “Oh, I’m sure I beg your pardon, miss. I’ve been fairly pestered with these newspaper people. Not a minute’s peace. No, the house isn’t let nor likely to be now.” “Are the drains wrong?” I asked in an anxious whisper. “Oh, Lord, miss, the drains is all right! But surely you’ve heard about that foreign lady as was done to death here?” “I believe I did read something about it in the papers,” I said carelessly. My indifference piqued the good woman. If I had betrayed any interest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster. As it was, she positively bridled. “I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The Daily Budget’s out still to catch the man who did it. It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope they’ll get him although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him ah, well, I dare say he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad they’re a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman. Stood there where you’re standing now.” “Was she dark or fair?” I ventured. “You can’t tell from these newspaper portraits.” “Dark hair, and a very white face too white for nature, I thought, and her lips reddened something cruel. I don’t like to see it a little powder now and then is quite another thing.” We were conversing like old friends now. I put another question. “Did she seem nervous or upset at all?” “Not a bit. She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she was amused at something. That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.” “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?” “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on, and, as my John says, money is money nowadays.” I concurred heartily with John’s by no means original remarks. “The young man now,” said Mrs. James, reverting suddenly to a former point in the conversation. “He was upset. His eyes, light eyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining. Excited, I thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong. Not even when he came out again looking all queer.” “How long was he in the house?” “Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.” “How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?” “I should say so maybe.” “He was clean-shaven, you say?” “Yes, miss not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.” “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it was. However did you know?” “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.” “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?” “Just the ordinary kind, miss. I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?” I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence my question to Mrs. James. Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low old-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key, I passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn and mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had come here “smiling to herself” a few days ago feel no chill of premonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil.",0
"Hastings, there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can happen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘I am a leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.” “What?” I ejaculated. “It was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the South Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough.",0
"“There’s something very queer about all this,” he said. “To begin with, where is Rayburn?” It’s perfectly true that we haven’t seen the fellow since we came on shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however. Altogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter. I can’t take him about with me in his present condition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray’s billet-doux, but I shall not take Pagett with me.",0
"They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my er experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself.",0
"I declare I really must run up and get it!” “Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!” “Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.” The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly. “Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,” explained the latter. “Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. “Well, they are worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the money’s there all right; I could get what I paid for them any day perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are now. Money’s confoundedly tight in the City. All this infernal E.P.D.” He rambled on, launching into technicalities where I could not follow him. He was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured something in his ear. “Eh what? I’ll come at once. Not taken ill, is she? Excuse me, gentlemen.” He left us abruptly. Poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny Russian cigarettes. Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the result. The minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return. “Curious,” I remarked, at length. “I wonder when they will come back.” Poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said thoughtfully: “They will not come back.” “Why?” “Because, my friend, something has happened.” “What sort of thing? How do you know?” I asked curiously. Poirot smiled. “A few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs. He was much agitated. The lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times, but he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are distrait; and to make a waiter distrait” Poirot shook his head with an air of finality. “The affair must indeed be of the first magnitude. Ah, it is as I thought! Here come the police.” Two men had just entered the hotel one in uniform, the other in plain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered upstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting. “Mr. Opalsen’s compliments, and would you step upstairs.” Poirot sprang nimbly to his feet. One would have said that he awaited the summons. I followed with no less alacrity. The Opalsens’ apartments were situated on the first floor. After knocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the summons, “Come in!” A strange scene met our eyes. The room was Mrs. Opalsen’s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an arm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. She presented an extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr. Opalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials stood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An hotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the fire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman, obviously Mrs.",0
"But the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher would take that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms, makes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen containing his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be thoroughly welcome to his money.",0
"In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin.",0
"“So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.” “En vérité! And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, mon cher?” I thought. “About a dozen times perhaps.” “And I once! Yet I recognize her, and you do not.” “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly. “Ah! Sacré!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.",0
"“That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot.",0
"""And I don’t know that I’m so comfortably married either,” continued Suzanne in a melancholy voice. “I’ve been having the most dreadful cables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once. At last I didn’t answer them, and now I haven’t heard for over a fortnight.” I’m afraid I didn’t take Suzanne’s matrimonial troubles very seriously. She will be able to get round Clarence all right when the times comes. I turned the conversation to the subject of the diamonds. Suzanne looked at me with a dropped jaw. “I must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect Colonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds.",0
"What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?” “I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.” “By threats eh? You seriously advance that supposition?” “Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter’s marriage.” “You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the whip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.",0
"Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.” “But your contract here?” “I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will ever know that I have left France. And why do you think that I go?” “Hardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?” “Exactly.” She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. “You said just now that none of us had anything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have had the wit and, yes, the courage for it needs courage to double-cross him.",0
"""Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the body, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I’ve never had a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It’ll last me all my life?” I turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s ghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women were. Now I knew.",0
"But why did you go to Marlow?” “It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances yes, I still feel natural under the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I cried desperately. For the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me. “I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I fail to see your concern in the matter.” He was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt desperate.",0
"Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief “Bien, j’y serai” he rang off, and turned to me. “What do you think, mon ami?” He looked half ashamed, half excited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.” “What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?” “This morning, I understand.” I shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me. You see I was right.",0
"I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling.",0
"“Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud. Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care, also the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at Giraud. “You saw these?” “Yes, I saw them,” replied the other. His face remained inscrutable. Suddenly Poirot stiffened. “Dr. Durand!” “Yes?” The doctor came forward. “There is foam on the lips. You observed it?” “I didn’t notice it, I must admit.” “But you observe it now?” “Oh, certainly.” Poirot again shot a question at Giraud. “You noticed it without doubt?” The other did not reply. Poirot proceeded. The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all. What do you think, M. le docteur?” “I can only say that it is most abnormal.” “It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed after he was dead.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M. Giraud agrees with me, do you not, monsieur?” Whatever Giraud’s real belief, he accepted the position without moving a muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied: “Certainly I agree.” The murmur of surprise and interest broke out again. “But what an idea!” cried M. Hautet. “To stab a man after he is dead! Barbaric! Unheard of! Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.” “No, M. le juge,” said Poirot. “I should fancy it was done quite cold-bloodedly to create an impression.” “What impression?” “The impression it nearly did create,” returned Poirot oracularly. M. Bex had been thinking. “How, then, was the man killed?” “He was not killed. He died. He died, M. le juge, if I am not much mistaken, of an epileptic fit!” This statement of Poirot’s again aroused considerable excitement. Dr. Durand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. At last he rose to his feet. “Well, M. le docteur?” “M. Poirot, I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your assertion. I was misled to begin with. The incontrovertible fact that the man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other indications.” Poirot was the hero of the hour. The examining magistrate was profuse in compliments. Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself on the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he wished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave the shed, Giraud approached us. “One more thing, M. Poirot,” he said, in his suave mocking voice. “We found this coiled round the handle of the dagger. A woman’s hair.” “Ah!” said Poirot. “A woman’s hair? What woman’s, I wonder?” “I wonder also,” said Giraud. Then, with a bow, he left us. “He was insistent, the good Giraud,” said Poirot thoughtfully, as we walked towards the hotel. “I wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me? A woman’s hair h’m!” We lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris. “Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find this.” He took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the reproduction of a woman’s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an exclamation. “You recognize it, my friend?” I nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back, and the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was unmistakable. “Madame Daubreuil!” I exclaimed. Poirot shook his head with a smile. “Not quite correct, my friend. She did not call herself by that name in those days. That is a picture of the notorious Madame Beroldy!” Madame Beroldy! In a flash the whole thing came back to me. The murder trial that had evoked such world-wide interest. The Beroldy Case. Some twenty years or so before the opening of the present story, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, a native of Lyons, arrived in Paris accompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter, a mere babe. Monsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a stout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his charming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in which Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although doing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The Beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with. But unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of Romance. Young and good looking, and gifted withal with a singular charm of manner, Madame Beroldy at once created a stir in the quarter, especially when it began to be whispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth. It was rumoured that she was the illegitimate daughter of a Russian Grand Duke. Others asserted that it was an Austrian Archduke, and that the union was legal, though morganatic. But all stories agreed upon one point, that Jeanne Beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery. Questioned by the curious, Madame Beroldy did not deny these rumours. On the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her “lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. To intimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political intrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. There was also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with herself acting as the go-between. Amongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young lawyer, Georges Conneau.",0
"“And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s have your deductions, Hastings.” “‘Obvious, my dear Watson,’” I quoted lightly. “She went to the wrong flat.” “Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” cried Mrs. Robinson admiringly. I rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities. The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities. “A curious story,” he said thoughtfully.",0
"Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil. Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs. I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction.",0
"“I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I I excuse me” He bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly.",0
"But the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirot’s voice rose in mild reproof. “Never will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would I permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, mon ami.” This to the Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof: “See now, what I have done for you. I have saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our beautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and front. Straight into the arms of the police they will go.",0
"Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.",0
"The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.” Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?” “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.” “And the Conference is to be held?” “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.",0
"Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon a young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was employed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing at the same time as the papers.",0
"Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room.",0
"“Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables” “Oh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed. “Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters and er guides.” “Exactly,” I hastened to reply.",0
"I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement.",0
"There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat.",0
"How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town.",0
"We parted on that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’ “That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died. “I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will.",0
"If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully. Two bells went overhead. One o’clock! And nothing. Wait what was that? I heard the quick light patter of feet running running along the passage. Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell inside. “Save me,” he said hoarsely. “They’re after me.” It was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear footsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act.",0
"""If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.” “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same who accompanied him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?” Lord Estair smiled.",0
"” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did not confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak, don’t we?” I admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language.",0
"Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free but in order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation. And then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was.",0
"Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard. You wouldn’t like me to come with you, would you?” “I should love it.” “Nice girl. Sure you won’t change your mind and come and look for lions in Rhodesia?” “Quite sure.” “He must be a very handsome fellow,” said Sir Eustace plaintively.",0
"""Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?” “Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.” “Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I ” I hesitated. “I want to meet your sister.” We both laughed. “That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy we’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey, especially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed first thing is quite true. I’m not your kind. And that brings trouble I know that well enough.…” Her face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out of it.",0
"“You think so? Eh bien, I agree with you,” said Poirot. He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “Mon Dieu! But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, mon ami. At last I am on the right track. I am still in the dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.",0
"“I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M. Renauld?” “Over a year?” “Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?” “I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.” “In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?” “Absolutely.” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face.",0
"Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business from both sides. Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair, who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably. Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me. A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause.",0
"The possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the Anzora? Ah! voilà une femme, Hastings! What force, what self-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: ‘It does not matter now.’ And no one noticed no one realized the significance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play, poor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and, instead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now.",0
"I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly.",0
"” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? Eh bien, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a cause célèbre unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after ” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind.",0
"She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow.",0
"“His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily.",0
"Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All seemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will. Here it is.” Poirot ran through the document. “So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor who is he, by the way?” “M. Renauld’s secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once or twice for a week-end.” “And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise. Simply drawn up, but perfectly legal.",0
"Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly.",0
"“You seem to have met your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.” There was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to enter the room. His face lit at the sight of us. “You’re safe, Anne. I was afraid” He turned to Sir Eustace. “I’ve been after you for a long time, Pedler and at last I’ve got you.” “Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,” declared Sir Eustace airily. “These young people have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things.",0
"“Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll.” When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke. “It is as well, mon ami, that we have no affairs of moment on hand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.” “What investigation are you talking about?” “The remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new flat.” “Poirot, you are not serious!” “I am most serious.",0
"Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly. “A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah ” I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me. “This is out of the ordinary, mon ami. Read for yourself.” The letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold characteristic hand: “Villa Geneviève Merlinville-sur-Mer France “Dear Sir, “I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I will give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have heard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be discreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account of a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life. I am convinced that the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if you will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several years of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee. “Assuring you once more that the matter is urgent, “Yours faithfully “P. T. RENAULD.” Below the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “For God’s sake, come!” I handed the letter back with quickened pulses. “At last!” I said. “Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.” “Yes, indeed,” said Poirot meditatively. “You will go of course,” I continued. Poirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his mind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave. “See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty of time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion. You accompany me, n’est-ce pas?” “Well ” “You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.” “Oh, that’s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.” “Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the name?” “There’s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name’s Renauld. I don’t know whether it could be the same.” “But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is in Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress finely.” “Dear me, Poirot,” I said, my excitement rising, “I smell some goodly shekels in this. If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!” “Do not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are not so easily parted. Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out a tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.” I acknowledged the wisdom of this. “In any case,” continued Poirot, “it is not the money which attracts me here. Certainly it will be pleasant to have carte blanche in our investigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest. You remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?” I considered. “Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the end his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he scrawled those four desperate words.” But my friend shook his head energetically. “You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?” “Well?” I said puzzled. “Mon Dieu, mon ami, but use your little grey cells! Is it not obvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it carefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last words, and blotted the sheet.” “But why?” “Parbleu! so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you.” “What?” “Mais, oui to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was dissatisfied. It was not strong enough!” He paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement: “And so, mon ami, since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible.” “Merlinville,” I murmured thoughtfully. “I’ve heard of it, I think.” Poirot nodded. “It is a quiet little place but chic! It lies about midway between Bolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English people who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in England, I suppose?” “Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the country, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little about him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. I believe he has large South American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life out in Chile and the Argentino.” “Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us pack. A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.” “And the Countess?” I inquired with a smile. “Ah! je m’en fiche! Her case was certainly not interesting.” “Why so sure of that?” “Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot wait always remember that, Hastings.” Eleven o’clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover. Before starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais.",0
"It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts. From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.",0
"""How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed.",0
"Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, la pauvre dame! She will eat nothing but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, par exemple, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur.",0
"But at last I see clearly.” “You know everything?” “I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.” “And you know the murderer?” “I know one murderer.” “What do you mean?” “We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but two. The first I have solved, the second eh bien, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.",0
"“Now then, stand back there, will you? What’s the sense in crowding round.” A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I must get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up, another having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so, he dropped a piece of paper. I stopped, picked it up, and ran after him. But the lift gates clanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand.",0
"He described the methods of housing the natives, the searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers took. “Then it’s practically impossible to steal any diamonds?” asked Mrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express purpose. “Nothing’s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.” “Yes, but on a large scale?” “Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?” I nodded. “Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld.",0
"Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream. “My God!” cried Lord Yardly. “That was Maude’s voice! What has happened?” We rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the darkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight met our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck. As we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive, her eyelids opened.",0
"""Come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of details as clues?” “By no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger is they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant; one or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells” he tapped his forehead “on which one must rely. The senses mislead. One must seek the truth within not without.” “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?” “That is exactly what I do mean granted the facts were placed before me.",0
"The time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough to leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let me go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long moody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by himself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple meal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was sinking. Hairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been able to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my knees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation.",0
"But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M.",0
"“If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started” “My dear fellow,” I interrupted brutally, “that was a bilious attack. You’re always having bilious attacks.” Pagett winced slightly. “It wasn’t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time “For God’s sake, don’t go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don’t want to hear them.” “Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!” “Ah!” I said. “You’ve been talking to Rayburn.” He did not deny it.",0
"“Pardon, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.",0
"Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean that you’re in on that?” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as she regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she remained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically. “Well, if that doesn’t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all the horrors.” “What do you mean?” “What I say. Bless the boy, didn’t I tell you I doted on crimes? What do you think I’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over this stubble? I’ve been nosing round for hours.",0
"I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my unchanging devotion.” “And you did see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face. There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed.",0
"Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up. Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points.",0
"All Papa’s friends were aged Professors usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a “neat little waist” and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a “neat little waist” since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always “felled their opponent with a single blow.",0
"I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say ‘Go!’” “Go!” I said. With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning. “Well, mon ami?” he demanded of me breathlessly. “Forty-six seconds,” I replied. “You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.",0
"""That’s another story,” I quoted. “My story. And I’m going to tell it you now.” Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been in my possession or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds.",0
"It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I understood everything understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last my own heart.… “Yes,” I said gently. “Is he looking for me?” she half whispered. Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big chair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping. I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair back from her face. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know I know everything.” “Oh, but you don’t!” “I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked: “It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action. “Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused.",0
"Blair hailed me as I came on deck. “Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though you hadn’t slept well.” “Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently. “Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t bore me to death to talk to.” “That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you only it’s more understandable in your case. You’re you’re such an exquisitely finished product.",0
"Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard which every one would perceive, bien entendu I much prefer that we should voyage together.",0
"You may be very sure he won’t overlook a footprint, or a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. He’s got eyes that see everything.” “So, mon ami,” said Poirot, “has the London sparrow. But all the same, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of Mr. Davenheim.” “Come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of details as clues?” “By no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger is they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant; one or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells” he tapped his forehead “on which one must rely. The senses mislead. One must seek the truth within not without.” “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?” “That is exactly what I do mean granted the facts were placed before me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.” Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand or rather tell me where to lay my hand on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.” Poirot considered. “Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now the facts.” “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After tea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added that he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come before he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door, passed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and was never seen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.” “Pretty very pretty altogether a charming little problem,” murmured Poirot. “Proceed, my good friend.” “About a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick black moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he had an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen, and in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into the study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return. Finally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable to wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed unaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor. Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure. “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment. “On Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light. Behind a portière in Mr. Davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that safe had been broken into and rifled. The windows were fastened securely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having intervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is likely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained undetected until Monday.” “Précisément,” said Poirot dryly. “Well, is he arrested, ce pauvre M. Lowen?” Japp grinned. “Not yet. But he’s under pretty close supervision.” Poirot nodded. “What was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?” “We’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large transaction having been just carried through. There was also a small fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim’s jewels were kept in the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem.” “Altogether a good haul,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Now, what about Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that evening?” “Well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen is a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been able once or twice to score a coup off Davenheim in the market, though it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter concerning some South American shares which led the banker to make his appointment.” “Had Davenheim interests in South America, then?” “I believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in Buenos Ayres.” “Any trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good terms?” “I should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful.",0
"…” I did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There appeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least of it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me with a finger to its lips. It was Giraud. Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. “What were you doing there?” I asked. “Exactly what you were doing listening.” “But I was not there on purpose!” “Ah!” said Giraud.",0
"“The Chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “The Chinaman the side door.” Lord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart beating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry. There, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace, evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I swooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord Yardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.",0
"A bad night but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.” “You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health.",0
"“I will call the police.” Poirot prepared to descend the steps. “No, don’t do that for Heaven’s sake!” The man dashed after him. With a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted. “Quick in here.” Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so. “And you behind the curtain.” “Si, signor,” said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window. Not a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form. “Where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance. “Who are you?” Poirot stepped forward with a bow. “It is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. I observed that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown was a warm one.” “Who are you? What are you doing in my house?” “It is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance, madame. It is especially to be regretted as one of our number has come specially from New York in order to meet you.” The curtains parted and the Italian stepped out. To my horror I observed that he was brandishing my revolver, which Poirot must doubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab. The woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but Poirot was standing in front of the closed door. “Let me by,” she shrieked. “He will murder me.” “Who was it dat croaked Luigi Valdarno?” asked the Italian hoarsely, brandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. We dared not move. “My God, Poirot, this is awful. What shall we do?” I cried. “You will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, Hastings. I can assure you that our friend will not shoot until I give the word.” “Youse sure o’ dat, eh?” said the Italian, leering unpleasantly. It was more than I was, but the woman turned to Poirot like a flash. “What is it you want?” Poirot bowed. “I do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardt’s intelligence by telling her.” With a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone. “They are stitched in the lining of that.” “Clever,” murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the door. “Good evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New York whilst you make your getaway.” “Whatta fool!” roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he fired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as I flung myself upon him. But the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirot’s voice rose in mild reproof. “Never will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would I permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, mon ami.” This to the Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof: “See now, what I have done for you. I have saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our beautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and front. Straight into the arms of the police they will go. Is not that a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room now. But be careful be very careful. IAh, he is gone! And my friend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all so simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several hundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that singled them out from the rest at practically a glance. Their appearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!” “But there’s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,” I cried. “It’s quite a common name.” “Ah! Sapristi, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and her husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New York, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the Camorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their track. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler? They offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of young couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be several Robinsons. It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look at the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will realize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives. He knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over, vengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me to the real Mrs. Robinson that delightful and truthful creature! What will they think when they find their flat has been broken into! We must hurry back. Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends arriving.” A mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker. “How did you know this address?” I asked as I followed Poirot out into the hall. “Oh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson followed when she left the other flat.” “A la bonne heure, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last. Now for a little surprise for Japp.",0
"Poirot was very sorry for the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance Company, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said gently to Mrs. Maltravers: “Madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!” “What do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide. “Have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? You are mediumistic, you know.” “I have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism, surely?” “Madame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say in the village that this house is haunted?” She nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready.",0
"She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room and found yourself in the hands of your enemies!” Harry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to Sir Eustace. “Yes,” murmured the latter, “decidedly you are not lucky! This is let me see, the third encounter.” “You are right,” said Harry. “This is the third encounter. Twice you have worsted me have you never heard that the third time the luck changes? This is my round cover him, Anne.” I was all ready. In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order. The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know. I had the girl’s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn’t got it on you a minute ago?” “Yes, I had,” I replied. “It was in my stocking.” “I don’t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table. “The young are always so violent,” he said reproachfully. “Unable to use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk sense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of affairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are hopelessly outnumbered. Your momentary ascendency has been gained by an accident” “Has it?” Something in Harry’s voice, a grim raillery, seemed to attract Sir Eustace’s attention. He stared at him. “Has it?” said Harry again. “Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say.” Still covering him with the revolver, he went on: “The cards are against you this time. To begin with, listen to that!” That was a dull banging at the door below. There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race and his people. You didn’t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne.” A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him covered with the revolver. “So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up. It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race’s men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.” Sir Eustace turned suddenly. “Very clever. Very creditable. But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you. You’ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that’s all you’ve got against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her and your record’s against you. You’re a thief, remember, a thief. There’s one thing you don’t know, perhaps. I’ve got the diamonds. And here goes” With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite. “There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we’ll talk. I’ll drive a bargain with you. You’ve got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. There’s a chance for me if I can get away. I’m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man! There’s a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes’ start and I shall be all right. I’ve got one or two little arrangements all ready made. You let me out that way, and give me a start and I leave you a signed confession that I killed Nadina.” “Yes, Harry,” I cried. “Yes, yes, yes!” He turned a stern face on me.",0
"It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition a je ne sais quoi!” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side.",0
"” Poirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady Yardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game. “Vous êtes bonne mère,” said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse. Lady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair. “I adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice. “And they you with reason!” Poirot bowed again. A dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms.",0
"“We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.” “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.” Miss Marvell nodded. “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.",0
"” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.",0
"I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped. To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.",0
"” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills.",0
"“They have arrested me, mother.” “What?” She uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait. She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.” Denise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him. “Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?” Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely: “I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it. Of course Giraud is all wrong wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not because of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all that I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts not by my leading you by the hand.” We established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested, looking out to sea. From farther along the sand, the cries of the bathers reached us faintly. The sea was of the palest blue, and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my own good spirits, and Poirot’s suggestion that I was “fey.” What a long time seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only three days! “Think, my friend,” said Poirot’s voice encouragingly. “Arrange your ideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.” I endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of the case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that of Giraud which Poirot despised. I reflected anew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case. Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there I must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up my hypothesis. “You have a little idea, I see, mon ami! Capital. We progress.” I sat up, and lit a pipe. “Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say we although I dare say I would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.” “And who is that?” inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes. “Georges Conneau!” The next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. “Enfin! You have arrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning. You are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.” I was so flattered by the little man’s approval that I could hardly continue. But at last I collected my thoughts and went on. “Georges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to believe that he is dead.” “Aucunement,” agreed Poirot. “Proceed.” “Therefore we will assume that he is alive.” “Exactly.” “Or that he was alive until recently.” “De mieux en mieux!” “We will presume,” I continued, my enthusiasm rising, “that he has fallen on evil days. He has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp a what you will. He chances to come to Merlinville. There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love.” “Eh eh! The sentimentality,” warned Poirot. “Where one hates one also loves,” I quoted or misquoted. “At any rate he finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old wrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it likely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and Conneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there suddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. Now supposing Jack Renauld to appear. Madame Daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful consequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived. His father’s murderer is dead let them do their best to hush it up. Jack Renauld consents goes to the house and has an interview with his mother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?” I leaned back, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction. Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “I think that you should write for the Kinema, mon ami,” he remarked at last. “You mean ?” “It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me there but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.” “I admit that I haven’t gone into all the details, but ” “You have gone further you have ignored them magnificently. What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?” “I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.” “By threats eh? You seriously advance that supposition?” “Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter’s marriage.” “You are wrong, Hastings.",0
"Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs.",0
"Just as we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by the arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents. It was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure I had seen carved on the walls of the tomb. My blood literally froze at the sight. “Mon Dieu!” murmured Poirot, crossing himself vigorously. “Anubis, the jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.” “Some one is hoaxing us,” cried Dr. Tosswill, rising indignantly to his feet. “It went into your tent, Harper,” muttered Sir Guy, his face dreadfully pale.",0
"When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa. I have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at last the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins me to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by his master’s side.",0
"Nevertheless, many spiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her lover and not the only one! When the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another personage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of the United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming and mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful. About this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried on her husband’s behalf.",0
"He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.” “Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted. It was after midnight. I leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam. Ahead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark water. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange peace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream. And suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger. I had heard nothing, but I swung round instinctively. A shadowy form had crept up behind me. As I turned, it sprang. One hand gripped my throat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately, but I had no chance. I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling. My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship. There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap.",0
"His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.",0
"” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture and in connection with some case. I rather fancy ” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!” We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation.",0
"“There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace made his money!” “Suspecting him again?” “Suzanne, I’ve got into that state that I can’t help suspecting somebody! I don’t really suspect him but, after all, he is Pagett’s employer, and he did own the Mill House.",0
"The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have further proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the adjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never looked at a petticoat!” The secretary’s eyes narrowed. “Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul Renauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s some other explanation.” The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “What other explanation could there be?” “What leads you to think it was a love affair?” “Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! mon Dieu! What else could it be?” “Blackmail,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor. “The old man was being bled and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet. “Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it. What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M. Renauld?” “Over a year?” “Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?” “I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.” “In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?” “Absolutely.” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face.",0
"“I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr. Vavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.” “I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs’s?” “I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.” “And no clerk has had access to them?” Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago in fact on the very day that Philip left us. He has only just recovered.” “Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw ruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.” Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out. “I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street. “You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.” “It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, mon ami. I do not expect to find in a Bank manager a ‘keen financier with an eagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am disappointed in the case it is too easy!” “Easy?” “Yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?” “You know who stole the bonds?” “I do.” “But then we must why” “Do not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going to do anything at present.” “But why? What are you waiting for?” “For the Olympia. She is due on her return trip from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.” “To a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, mon ami, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I wait eh bien to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is perfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly gifted by the good God the Inspector McNeil, for instance it would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself.” “Good Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I’d give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself just for once. You’re so confoundedly conceited!” “Do not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there are times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties of greatness!” The little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that I was forced to laugh. Tuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicions or certainties. He contented himself with expressing surprise that I, too, was not equally au fait with the situation. I disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference. Once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of Poirot’s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd. “An elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. A great invalid, hardly moved out of his cabin.” The description appeared to tally with one Mr. Ventnor who had occupied the cabin C 24 which was next to that of Philip Ridgeway. Although unable to see how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnor’s existence and personal appearance, I was keenly excited. “Tell me,” I cried, “was this gentleman one of the first to land when you got to New York?” The steward shook his head. “No, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat.” I retired crestfallen, and observed Poirot grinning at me. He thanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our departure. “It’s all very well,” I remarked heatedly, “but that last answer must have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!” “As usual, you see nothing, Hastings. That last answer is, on the contrary, the coping-stone of my theory.” I flung up my hands in despair. “I give it up.” When we were in the train, speeding towards London, Poirot wrote busily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope. “This is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland Yard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I have asked Miss Esmée Farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us.” “What about Ridgeway?” “What about him?” asked Poirot with a twinkle. “Why, you surely don’t think you can’t” “The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a matter of fact I did think. If Ridgeway had been the thief which was perfectly possible the case would have been charming; a piece of neat methodical work.” “But not so charming for Miss Farquhar.” “Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now, Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes, as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore” “Yes, but we know” “You may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since it seemed incredible, it was incredible. Two possibilities remain: it was hidden on board also rather difficult or it was thrown overboard.” “With a cork on it, do you mean?” “Without a cork.” I stared. “But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been sold in New York.",0
"It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race’s men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.” Sir Eustace turned suddenly. “Very clever. Very creditable. But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you. You’ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that’s all you’ve got against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her and your record’s against you.",0
"I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and said: “Come out at once, please,” in an acid voice. There was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He did not move. “Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What am I to do?” Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor. Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough. He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade a nasty deep wound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it.",0
"By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more. Now, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I place the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.” I stared at him, stupefied. “But how? Why? How can you possibly know?” “Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained. Mon ami, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do you not now see what is so glaringly plain?” “My dear Poirot, I can’t see anything glaring about it. I did think I was beginning to see my way before, but I’m now hopelessly fogged.” Poirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. “Mon Dieu! But it is triste! A good intelligence and so deplorably lacking in method. There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells. I will impart it to you ” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, ne vous impatientez pas! I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, mon ami, let me ask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?” “Georges Conneau,” I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily. “Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that was Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as Georges Conneau is not Jack Renauld, follows that the third case is put out of court. And, still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is equally so. So we are forced to the second that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “Bien! Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but ” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love.” I shook my head perplexed. “Mais, oui, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so dearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?” I stared dumbfounded.",0
"“I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I.",0
"“Mon Dieu! But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when ” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.” “You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then ” “Eh bien?” “Well, we are hunting together again, and ” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, mon ami, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil.",0
"I took her hands in both of mine. My eyes said the rest. Poirot cleared his throat. “Mes enfants,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “Très bien, mon enfant,” said Poirot.",0
"Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island.",0
"Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I could not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to him, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do.",0
"“Well?” I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on all the vital facts. Poirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “Mon pauvre ami! But it is that you have not the gift! The important detail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.” “How?” “Let me take your four points. “One: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could not know beforehand that Mr.",0
"""Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that.",0
"I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it. It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: "". 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any importance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure. Moth balls again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt strongly of them. But, then I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking. I explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea. After that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry out a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was watching the doctor examine the body. First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had got what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls. There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident. That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and when Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me. “Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest. You say no one else was near enough to see what happened?” “I had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can’t be sure and, anyway, they wouldn’t be as near as I was.” The inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure. The deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been found in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel. The bureau clerk from the hotel identified the man as having arrived the day before and booked a room under that name. He had registered as L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He had evidently come straight off the steamer. I was the only person who had seen anything of the affair. “You think it was an accident?” the coroner asked me. “I am positive of it. Something alarmed him, and he stepped backwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.” “But what could have alarmed him?” “That I don’t know. But there was something. He looked panic-stricken.” A stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats. The man might have seen a cat. I didn’t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide. “It is extraordinary to me,” said the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward. His name and address should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular not to do so.” I smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor. In pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard at an early date. But the next morning brought a surprise. The Flemmings took in the Daily Budget, and the Daily Budget was having a day after its own heart. EXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT. WOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. In an upper room of the Mill House the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday, strangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not been identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.” Nobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited the following facts. Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and her address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body. Mrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler’s gardener, who acted as caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge opening on the main road, gave evidence. About three o’clock that afternoon, a lady came to see over the house. She produced an order from the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James gave her the keys of the house. It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit.",0
"You’ve scored over him handsomely.” “That poor Giraud,” said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest. “Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had la mauvaise chance once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for instance. To say the least, it was misleading.” “To tell you the truth, Poirot,” I said slowly, “even now I don’t quite see whose hair was it?” “Madame Renauld’s of course. That is where la mauvaise chance came in. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered.",0
"He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you must have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room her boudoir,” he explained.",0
"I imitated her example most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined.",0
"“I do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardt’s intelligence by telling her.” With a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone. “They are stitched in the lining of that.” “Clever,” murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the door. “Good evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New York whilst you make your getaway.” “Whatta fool!” roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he fired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as I flung myself upon him.",0
"” Then, frowning, he gazed down at the body. “Should you say that was a Spanish type at all?” he asked suddenly. I considered the face carefully. “No,” I said at last. “I should put him down as a Frenchman most decidedly.” Giraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction. “Same here.” He stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of the floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by inch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks.",0
"How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong. When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock something would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time. If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully. Two bells went overhead. One o’clock! And nothing. Wait what was that? I heard the quick light patter of feet running running along the passage. Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell inside. “Save me,” he said hoarsely. “They’re after me.” It was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear footsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act. I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the middle of the cabin. A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it under the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other hand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it was supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from her trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be suspected of harbouring a fugitive. There was a knock at the door, and without waiting for me to say, “Come in,” it was pushed open. I don’t know what I expected to see. I think I had vague ideas of Mr. Pagett brandishing a revolver. Or my missionary friend with a sandbag, or some other lethal weapon. But certainly I did not expect to see a night stewardess, with an inquiring face and looking the essence of respectability. “I beg your pardon, miss, I thought you called out.” “No,” I said, “I didn’t.” “I’m sorry for interrupting you.” “That’s all right,” I said. “I couldn’t sleep. I thought a wash would do me good.” It sounded rather as though it were a thing I never had as a general rule. “I’m so sorry, miss,” said the stewardess again. “But there’s a gentleman about who’s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies’ cabins and frighten them.” “How dreadful,” I said, looking alarmed. “He won’t come in here, will he?” “Oh, I don’t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.” “Good night.” I opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight. Drunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents had been wasted. I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and said: “Come out at once, please,” in an acid voice. There was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He did not move. “Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What am I to do?” Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor. Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough. He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade a nasty deep wound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it. At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up. “Keep still, please,” I said. He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a little. “Thank you, I don’t need anything done for me.” His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks of even common gratitude! “That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” He flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour of him. My temper, never placid, rose. “I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,” I said coldly. “I can at least relieve you of my presence.” He started for the door, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed him down upon the sofa. “Don’t be a fool,” I said unceremoniously. “You don’t want to go bleeding all over the ship, do you?” He seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as best I could. “There,” I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, “that will have to do for the present. Are you better tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it’s all about?” “I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.” “Why not?” I said, chagrined.",0
"Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe.",0
"I’ve met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her, and should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn ass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her. He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work.",0
"Or, at leastThere I was again dreaming! The real problem was what to do _now! I, priding myself upon my rôle of watcher, had become the watched. And I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve. I was the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of the great machine and I fancied that the machine would have a short way with little bits of grit. Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once I had saved myself but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily against me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and they were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter. I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so. In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform. A porter tried to stop me, but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the footboard. I mounted the two steps and opened the gate. I was safe! The train was gathering way. We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I waved to him. “Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,” I shouted. Never have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he had seen a ghost. In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily.",0
"Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.",0
"London! The place for things to happen. “It’s awfully kind of you,” I said. “Might I really? Just while I’m looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?” “Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something suitable.” I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of “something suitable” and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. “That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?” “Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming” “My wife will be delighted to welcome you.",0
"""You are sure of that?” “I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?” “Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?” Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated apologetically.",0
"""Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?” I told her something about Papa’s life work. “So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t a mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls?” “I may,” I said cautiously. “I’ve got other plans as well.” “What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning. Didn’t you sleep well? I can’t keep awake on board a boat. Ten hours’ sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!” She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten.",0
"They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any price, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs.",0
"“You permit that I see whether it matches?” With a cry she started backwards, white to the lips. “It is false I swear it. I know nothing of the crime of either crime. Any one who says I do lies! Ah! mon Dieu, what shall I do?” “Calm yourself, madame,” said Giraud coldly. “No one has accused you as yet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.” “Anything you wish, monsieur.” “Look at the dead man.",0
"He succeeded in getting the case dismissed but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer. He cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father’s disbelief. He came out furious from the interview his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me. I had been madly in love with her for the moment I even think that I frightened her sometimes but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead. All I felt was, ‘What’s the good?’ My pal was dead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I was supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful existence here, neither happy nor unhappy numbed of all feeling. I see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was partly the effect of the war. “And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I was taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river, and I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation. It focused my attention on him. He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him. She had got in with a bad lot, he told me and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story. It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter. I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle, which left Cape Town in two days’ time. I had just time to journey down and catch the same boat. “I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board. I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge, and it was comparatively easy for me to transform myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age.",0
"It was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out. We came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in our tour. I found him studying the centre table with close attention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany table. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but the three dessert plates were untouched. There were three coffee-cups with remains of coffee in them two black, one with milk.",0
"“Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M. Jack Renauld.” “What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?” “Giraud.” “Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will he will ” She broke off. There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently.",0
"Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something something that would happen soon. I was excited restless. After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge. It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls their elusive quality.",0
"I was in a small room with rough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer. The tears were running down my face. I was weak still, but I held his hand in both of mine. If only I could die like this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new look in his eyes. “Don’t cry, Anne. Please don’t cry. You’re safe now. No one shall hurt you.” He went and fetched a cup and brought it to me. “Drink some of this milk.” I drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used to a child. “Don’t ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You’ll be stronger by and by. I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several questions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English. Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.” “That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.",0
"""Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack.",0
"My original idea was to stay a couple of days or so at the Falls which I’ve never seen, though this is my third visit to Africa and then go on to Jo’burg and study the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I pose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all I hear, Jo’burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit in about a week’s time. I don’t want to study conditions in the midst of a raging revolution.” Race smiled in a rather superior manner. “I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace.",0
"""Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door. Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen. “This necklace it was, without doubt, insured?” Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question. “Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.” “But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.” “I comprehend, madame,” said Poirot soothingly. “I comprehend perfectly.",0
"“Why, you surely don’t think you can’t” “The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a matter of fact I did think. If Ridgeway had been the thief which was perfectly possible the case would have been charming; a piece of neat methodical work.” “But not so charming for Miss Farquhar.” “Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now, Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes, as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air.",0
"Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself.",0
"No, no no trouble, I assure you.” Poirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady Yardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game. “Vous êtes bonne mère,” said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse. Lady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair. “I adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice. “And they you with reason!” Poirot bowed again. A dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly. With an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at my friend. “Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about this. It’s from Hoffberg. He thinks he’s found a customer for the diamond an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They’re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if this goes through” Words failed him. Lady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her hand. “I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said, in a low voice. “It’s been in the family so long.” She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her shoulders. “I must go and dress. I suppose I had better display ‘the goods.’” She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. “It’s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George has always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never been done.” She left the room. Half an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady. It was already a few minutes past the dinner hour. Suddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed in the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress. Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there with one hand just touching the necklace. “Behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to have vanished. “Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.” The switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened. Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream. “My God!” cried Lord Yardly. “That was Maude’s voice! What has happened?” We rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the darkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight met our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck.",0
"Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M.",0
"""In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company.",0
"But yes! Here it is! ‘Go it criminals all out! Hercule Poirot and believe me, girls, he’s some Hercules! our own pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’Cause why? ’Cause he’s got la grippe himself’!” I laughed. “Good for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character. And fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest during this time.” “That is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me with any regret.” Our landlady stuck her head in at the door. “There’s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain.",0
"I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up.",0
"“Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly.",0
"Then, when I had told him kindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking about some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge at Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort. I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter. I thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because the typewriter was sure to have gone wrong it always does and he would have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten Pagett’s powers of being in the right. “I’ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace.",0
"Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall. I looked round me and then caught my breath with a gasp.",0
"Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several questions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English. Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.",0
"” Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket. “It is now a quarter to nine.” “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully. “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur it may come in useful. Now for the details the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?” “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.",0
"""I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.” He looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up flushed and excited. “God help me, so you are,” he muttered, and went abruptly out. My recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most serious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be actually broken. A careful examination, however, convinced him that it was not so, and although it was very painful I was recovering the use of it quite quickly. It was a strange time.",0
"To begin with, Black answered well within the normal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘Day’ to ‘Night’ and ‘Place’ to ‘Name’ are normal associations. I began work with ‘Bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all. Evidently he had not.",0
"Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel my passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do. You’ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps.” At that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped forward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction. “Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black.” A few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited the fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn.",0
"“Good. Wait awhile.” About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat. “C’est ça. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.” “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily. Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift. “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us.",0
"My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A a fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs.",0
"If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife.",0
"In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots in the other, none! You see? Some one had passed that way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.” “Where did they get a rake?” “Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot impatiently. “There is no difficulty about that.” “What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, mon ami.",0
"Some gossip what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California why! it came to me in a flash of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf. “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing. “We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.” “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.” Miss Marvell nodded. “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.” “But I demand pardon if I am dense, madame surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?” A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older. “I want to wear it down there.” “Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?” “That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly. I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, c’est comme ça!” Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?” “Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do either of you ever see Society Gossip?” We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly. “I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it’s really very curious” She broke off. I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud: “. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more.",0
"It seems that all along she’s been on the track of “The Man in the Brown Suit.” Apparently she didn’t spot him on the Kilmorden_ in fact, she hardly had the chance, but she’s now very busy cabling home: “How I journeyed out with the Murderer,” and inventing highly fictitious stories of “What he said to me,” etc. I know how these things are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me. And of course one of Nasby’s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won’t recognize himself.",0
"He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.” “Eh bien?” “Well, they started from Boulogne but they never arrived.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.” “And the bogus car?” “Is still at large.” Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?” “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible but nothing has been discovered!” At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.” The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew. “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” “And they have found nothing else?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.” “If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.” “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same who accompanied him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?” Lord Estair smiled. “I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.” “Has he any relatives in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.” “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?” “That point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.” “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?” A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced anyone above suspicion.” “Très bien.",0
"On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely. It was rather a knotty problem. “We’ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,” I said. “And it’s not too late for morning tea,” said Suzanne. “We’ll have it in the lounge.” The Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated “eleven-o’clock tea.",0
"Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder ” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M.",0
"The wind was getting up, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp. “Ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried Poirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then turned the key in the lock. “I shall lock it, so!” “Don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now” And even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door slowly swung open.",0
"le juge.” “You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this attachment, madame.",0
"Davenheim would be absent posting a letter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!” “He might have seized his opportunity,” I suggested. “And the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s tools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with a penknife, bien entendu!” “Well, what about Number Two?” “You say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better of it is more likely to be the other way about.",0
"Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp.",0
"” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M.",0
"Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn’t rattle, and plugged it up again.” Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: “I always did hate that blinking giraffe,” he said. “It must have been instinct.” We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue.",0
"Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy’s return. He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood. “Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?” I followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural.",0
"I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it.",0
"The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all. What do you think, M. le docteur?” “I can only say that it is most abnormal.” “It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed after he was dead.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M.",0
"That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.",0
"I hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he negatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners he was sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he could not have failed to observe them. I do not know what put the idea into my head possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones but I asked suddenly: “Young M. Renauld he did not leave by that train, did he?” “Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour, it would not be amusing, that!” I stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.",0
"If O’Murphy is an honest man, why did he leave the main road? But if he was a dishonest man, why did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired thereby, in all probability, saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, again, if he was honest, why did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a well-known rendezvous of German spies?” “It looks bad,” I said. “Let us look at the case with method. What have we for and against these two men? Take O’Murphy first.",0
"He was tramping along the road to Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village, ‘dark-complexioned gent, with a big moustache, one of them city toffs,’ is his description of the man. “Kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just before he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down the road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge.",0
"“An idiot of a steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a moment!” “Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. “He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires you very much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.” “I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable than a hat.” I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race.",0
"” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t don’t,” I said fiercely.",0
"Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his train. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall. The automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to run for the station. I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and his face was white white with two burning spots of red. Ah, but he was angry!” Léonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly. “And the dispute, what was it about?” “Ah, that I do not know,” confessed Léonie. “It is true that they shouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so fast, that only one well acquainted with English could have comprehended. But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day! Impossible to please him!” The sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity. “And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.” “One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “Quelle idée,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the salon. It is cool there on this hot morning.” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind ” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?” “Well, I’d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he’s anywhere about, and see what he’s up to.” “The human foxhound,” murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a comfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “By all means, my friend. Au revoir.” I strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the path we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation. She not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an exclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella! The surprise was mutual. “You,” we both exclaimed simultaneously. The young lady recovered herself first. “My only Aunt!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” “For the matter of that, what are you?” I retorted. “When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home to England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket to and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?” I ignored the end of the speech. “When last I saw you,” I said, “you were trotting home with your sister, like a good little girl. By the way, how is your sister?” A flash of white teeth rewarded me. “How kind of you to ask! My sister is well, I thank you.” “She is here with you?” “She remained in town,” said the minx with dignity. “I don’t believe you’ve got a sister,” I laughed. “If you have, her name is Harris!” “Do you remember mine?” she asked, with a smile. “Cinderella. But you’re going to tell me the real one now, aren’t you?” She shook her head with a wicked look. “Not even why you’re here?” “Oh, that! I suppose you’ve heard of members of my profession ‘resting.’” “At expensive French watering-places?” “Dirt cheap if you know where to go.” I eyed her keenly. “Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?” “We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously. “There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime at the Villa Geneviève ?” She stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean that you’re in on that?” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as she regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she remained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically. “Well, if that doesn’t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all the horrors.” “What do you mean?” “What I say. Bless the boy, didn’t I tell you I doted on crimes? What do you think I’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over this stubble? I’ve been nosing round for hours. Tried the front way in, but that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn’t taking any. I guess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in one wouldn’t cut ice with him! It’s a real piece of luck happening on you this way. Come on, show me all the sights.” “But look here wait a minute I can’t. Nobody’s allowed in. They’re awfully strict.” “Aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?” I was loath to relinquish my position of importance. “Why are you so keen?” I asked weakly. “And what is it you want to see.” “Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the body, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I’ve never had a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It’ll last me all my life?” I turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s ghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women were.",0
"“And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes” he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?” Sarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us.",0
"Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well.",0
"Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face. He was thoroughly taken aback. What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room.",0
"He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep. I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I sprang up. Harry was on the stoep outside. “Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.” I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing. “Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing the things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?” “Yes,” I said, wondering what was coming. He caught me in his arms. “Anne, come away with me now to-night. Back to Rhodesia back to the island. I can’t stand all this tomfoolery. I can’t wait for you any longer.” I disengaged myself a minute. “And what about my French frocks?” I lamented mockingly. To this day Harry never knows when I’m in earnest and when I’m only teasing him. “Damn your French frocks. Do you think I want to put frocks on you? I’m a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I’m not going to let you go, do you hear? You’re my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose you. I’m never sure of you. You’re coming with me now to-night and damn everybody.” He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe. “I can’t do without you any longer, Anne. I can’t indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let’s go.” “My toothbrush?” I demurred. “You can buy one. I know I’m a lunatic, but for God’s sake, come!” He stalked off at a furious pace. I followed him as meekly as the Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn’t carrying a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very difficult to keep up with him. “Harry,” I said at last, in a meek voice, “are we going to walk all the way to Rhodesia?” He turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me up in his arms. “I’m mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.” “We’re a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me, but I’m not making a sacrifice at all! I wanted to come!” That was two years ago. We still live on the island. Before me, on the rough wooden table, is the letter that Suzanne wrote me. Dear Babes in the Wood Dear Lunatics in Love, I’m not surprised not at all. All the time we’ve been talking Paris and frocks I felt that it wasn’t a bit real that you’d vanish into the blue some day to be married over the tongs in the good old gipsy fashion. But you are a couple of lunatics! This idea of renouncing a vast fortune is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to argue the matter, but I have persuaded him to leave the argument to time. He can administer the estate for Harry and none better. Because, after all, honeymoons don’t last forever you’re not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a little wild-cat Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but one day you will suddenly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane, sumptuous furs, Paris frocks, the largest thing in motors and the latest thing in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses! Oh, yes, you will! But have your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and let it be a long one. And think of me sometimes, comfortably putting on weight amidst the fleshpots! Your loving friend, Suzanne Blair. P.S. I am sending you an assortment of frying-pans as a wedding present, and an enormous terrine of pâté de foie gras to remind you of me. There is another letter that I sometimes read. It came a good while after the other and was accompanied by a bulky packet. It appeared to be written from somewhere in Bolivia. My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I can’t resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it gives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn’t quite as clever as he thought himself, was he? I think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I’m sending you my diary. There’s nothing in it that would interest Race and his crowd, but I fancy that there are passages in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for the Daily Budget, “Criminals I have met.” I only stipulate that I shall be the central figure. By this time I have no doubt that you are no longer Anne Beddingfeld, but Lady Eardsley, queening it in Park Lane. I should just like to say that I bear you no malice whatever. It is hard, of course, to have to begin all over again at my time of life, but, entre nous, I had a little reserve fund carefully put aside for such a contingency. It has come in very usefully and I am getting together a nice little connection. By the way, if you ever come across that funny friend of yours, Arthur Minks, just tell him that I haven’t forgotten him, will you? That will give him a nasty jar. On the whole I think I have displayed a most Christian and forgiving spirit. Even to Pagett. I happened to hear that he or rather Mrs.",0
"I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!_” Diamonds! I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. “Are you sure, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear.",0
"” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.” “Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.” “What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.” “And last night?” “I fastened it as usual.” “You are sure of that?” “I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.” “What time would that be?” “The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.” “What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?” “Madame had retired some time before. Denise and Léonie went up with me. Monsieur was still in his study.” “Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?” Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. “What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out ” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “Cette dame? What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.” “Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment.",0
"How they meant to manage the body business originally, I do not know possibly an art student’s skeleton and a fire or something of the kind, but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their hands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the garden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and suddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M. Renauld calls his wife.",0
"“What was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?” “We’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large transaction having been just carried through. There was also a small fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim’s jewels were kept in the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem.” “Altogether a good haul,” said Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"""You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then ” “Eh bien?” “Well, we are hunting together again, and ” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, mon ami, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. Sacré! if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture and in connection with some case. I rather fancy ” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!” We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation. Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, la pauvre dame! She will eat nothing but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, par exemple, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur.",0
"There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films which I must have dropped somewhere later and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow.",0
"But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that.",0
"I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.",0
"A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes. “What is it?” I whispered. He shook his head impatiently, and asked a question: “Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself?” The commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied promptly: “No, Monsieur did not drive himself.” Poirot’s frown deepened. “I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently. “See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.” “Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested. “Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your own. Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a holiday suddenly, at a moment’s notice? Was it that for some reason he wanted him out of the way before we arrived?” Françoise had left the room. The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully on the table. “M. Bex,” he said at length, “here we have directly conflicting testimony. Which are we to believe, Françoise or Denise?” “Denise,” said the commissary decidedly. “It was she who let the visitor in. Françoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a dislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show that Renauld was entangled with another woman.” “Tiens!” cried M. Hautet. “We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “My dearest one:” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid. If you were to stop loving me! But that’s impossible what a silly kid I am always imagining things! But if you did stop loving me, I don’t know what I should do kill myself perhaps! I couldn’t live without you. Sometimes I fancy another woman is coming between us. Let her look out, that’s all and you too! I’d as soon kill you as let her have you! I mean it. “But there, I’m writing high-flown nonsense. You love me, and I love you yes, love you, love you, love you! “Your own adoring “BELLA.” There was no address or date. Poirot handed it back with a grave face. “And the assumption is, M. le juge ?” The examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right. We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically. “My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter ” “In Santiago,” finished the commissary. “I shall cable without delay to the police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s life out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his friendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange if, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.” The commissary looked round for approval. “Excellent,” said Poirot appreciatively. “His wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,” added the magistrate. “You have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All seemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will. Here it is.” Poirot ran through the document. “So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor who is he, by the way?” “M. Renauld’s secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once or twice for a week-end.” “And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise. Simply drawn up, but perfectly legal. Witnessed by the two servants, Denise and Françoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it back. “Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice ” “The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago. Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his amorous intrigues.” “Yes,” said M. Hautet doubtfully. “But it is possibly a little unfair on his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If she were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.",0
"I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker’s special hobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one. That’s what makes it so wonderful.” “Wonderful is the word! It’s a blinking miracle. But there must be a catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?” “No premium!” “No prem oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned Parker. “But we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued Mrs. Robinson. “Ah!” Parker brisked up. “I knew there was a catch!” “For fifty pounds. And it’s beautifully furnished!” “I give it up,” said Parker. “The present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy.” Mrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker appeared between her dainty brows. “It is queer, isn’t it? You don’t think that that the place is haunted?” “Never heard of a haunted flat,” declared Parker decisively. “N-o.” Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. “But there were several things about it all that struck me as well, queer.” “For instance” I suggested. “Ah,” said Parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused! Unburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries.” I laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle thrust upon me.",0
"“Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again.",0
"“What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her.",0
"“Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, cellela!” The old woman tossed her head scornfully. “Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.” “Voilà,” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the truth.” “Not at all,” said the examining magistrate soothingly. “We were surprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were ” he paused delicately. “Eh? It was that without doubt?” “How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was milor anglais trés riche and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one and trés chic for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but ma foi! I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not last night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.” “English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: “‘Yeas yeas butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’” “Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, voilà tout! So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",0
"And then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris, was sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and, without revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of the crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at Madame Beroldy’s instigation. The crime had been planned between them.",0
"""But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.” “If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly. “And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.” “I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.” “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway” “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.” “Who is his uncle?” “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.” “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?” “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.",0
"“Not the poison of the Borgias,” replied Poirot, with a twinkle. “I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk.” “French chalk?” “Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.” I laughed. “You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something exciting.” “Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!” The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush. The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.",0
"We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention to anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study. “I have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my friend,” he deigned to remark. “Now, behold!” Going straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the envelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly hope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care he cut open the envelope, laying it out flat.",0
"""I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves that sort of thing.” “If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.” “I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.” “Ah, that reminds me what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a secretary?” And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly.",0
"You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction.",0
"You can guess, I dare say. But I’ll tell you this I’ll clear my name, or die in the attempt, and I’ll choke the life out of the damned scoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.” “We must be fair,” I said. “He didn’t actually push me over.” “He’d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge.",0
"“Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered.",0
"“But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?” “He’s ill in bed with influenza.” “Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?” And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr.",0
"“We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “My dearest one:” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid.",0
"My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know.",0
"” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening. The show was wearisome beyond words or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so.",0
"You can guess, I dare say. But I’ll tell you this I’ll clear my name, or die in the attempt, and I’ll choke the life out of the damned scoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.” “We must be fair,” I said. “He didn’t actually push me over.” “He’d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge. He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story. “You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly. “I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track and, my God! that’s the place to know a friend. There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death could have broken. Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were crowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles. I can’t tell you our elation. It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.” “Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then in the hotel at Kimberley we met her” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn’t her game. Sometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn’t been, for Sir Laurence Eardsley’s only son was quite a parti. But the truth of it was that she was married to a sorter in De Beers’ though nobody knew of it. She pretended enormous interests in our discovery, and we told her all about it and even showed her the diamonds. Delilah that’s what she should have been called and she played her part well! “The De Beers robbery was discovered, and like a thunderclap the police came down upon us. They seized our diamonds. We only laughed at first the whole thing was so absurd. And then the diamonds were produced in court and without question they were the stones stolen from De Beers’. Anita Grünberg had disappeared. She had effected the substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not the stones originally in our possession was laughed to scorn. “Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence.",0
"“Also, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, mon ami, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below armed with that excellent revolver of yours, bien entendu!” “Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm. “When shall we start?” “The hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing is likely to occur before then.” At twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot’s manipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed into the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar. “Now we have but to wait,” said Poirot contentedly, closing his eyes. To me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to sleep. Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight hours and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes a faint scratching sound came to my ears. Poirot’s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there. Poirot placed his lips to my ear. “Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast. Be careful, he will have a knife.” Presently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light appeared through the door. It was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves against the wall. I heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. Then he flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear: “Allez.” We sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his arms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless. I twisted a dagger from his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes, whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man nodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive followed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were out in the street, Poirot turned to me. “There is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the revolver. We shall not need it now.” “But if this fellow tries to escape?” Poirot smiled. “He will not.” I returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. The scarf had been unwound from the stranger’s face, and I gave a start of surprise. “He’s not a Jap,” I ejaculated in a whisper to Poirot. “Observation was always your strong point, Hastings! Nothing escapes you. No, the man is not a Jap.",0
"But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily. “Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person you are.” Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. “I must report myself to my chief,” I said demurely. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office middle compartment dictating at an incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.” “This enthusiasm for work is something new,” I commented. “H’m!” said Colonel Race.",0
"I understand you have no living relatives?” “I’m alone in the world,” I said, and was struck anew by my likeness to a film heroine. “You have friends?” “Every one has been very kind to me,” I said gratefully. “Who would not be kind to one so young and charming?” said Mr. Flemming gallantly. “Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be done.” He hesitated a minute, and then said: “Supposing how would it be if you came to us for a time?” I jumped at the chance. London! The place for things to happen. “It’s awfully kind of you,” I said. “Might I really? Just while I’m looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?” “Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something suitable.” I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of “something suitable” and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. “That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?” “Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming” “My wife will be delighted to welcome you.” I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home orphans without consulting me first. “We will send her a wire from the station,” continued the lawyer. My few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat sadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a “Mary” hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out but doesn’t! A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim. With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot. The result had been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The “Mary” hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming’s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently disarming effect. Mr. Flemming was nervous too. I realized that as we went up the stairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming greeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the “good wife and mother” type. She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices. I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. “Well, Henry, why on earth” I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident.",0
"I loved it loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there always always. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home.",0
"Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up against civilization.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you make one error.",0
"If he’s got a reasonable explanation of that, we’re on the right tack.” He got up. “It’s past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before dawn I’ll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at Livingstone. I’ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away until the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira train there. I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.” “Beira,” I said meditatively. “Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to me.” We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at each other. “Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut. I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours. At last he called me: “Come, Anne, it’s time to go.” I got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I knew that dawn was not far off. “We’ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat” Harry began, when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand. “Hush! What’s that?” I listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the wilderness. Presently I heard it too the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage. We strained our eyes in the darkness, and could make out a dark blur on the surface of the water. It was a boat. Then there was a momentary spurt of flame. Some one had struck a match. By its light I recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at Muizenberg. The others were natives. “Quick back to the hut.” Harry swept me back with him. He took down a couple of rifles and a revolver from the wall. “Can you load a rifle?” “I never have. Show me how.” I grasped his instructions well enough. We closed the door and Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The boat was just about to run alongside it. “Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice. Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion. Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift. Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side. “We’ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it matters. I can get you across. It’s the wrong side for a boattoo many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side for Livingstone.” “I can swim a little farther than that. What’s the danger, Harry?” For I had seen the grim look on his face. “Sharks?” “No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you’re sharp, Anne. Crocs, that’s the trouble.” “Crocodiles?” “Yes, don’t think of them or say your prayers, whichever you feel inclined.” We plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know. The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios.",0
"“Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person you are.” Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. “I must report myself to my chief,” I said demurely. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office middle compartment dictating at an incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.” “This enthusiasm for work is something new,” I commented. “H’m!” said Colonel Race. “His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily. Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech atWhat’s the matter? Why aren’t you taking it down?” “I think,” said Colonel Race gently, “that Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.” He took it from her and sharpened it. Sir Eustace stared, and so did I. There was something in Colonel Race’s tone that I did not quite understand. (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) I am inclined to abandon my Reminiscences. Instead I shall write a short article entitled “Secretaries I have had.” As regards secretaries, I seem to have fallen under a blight. At one minute I have no secretaries, at another I have too many. At the present minute I am journeying to Rhodesia with a pack of women. Race goes off with the two best-looking, of course, and leaves me with the dud. That is what always happens to me and, after all, this is my private car, not Race’s. Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the beauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her principal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn’t even doing that. Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don’t blame her if so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew she is a repellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman. There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld. She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine for all the world as though she’d been running a race and yet Pagett told me that he’d seen her off to Durban last night! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body. And she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, “Secretaries I have had.” No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once. No. 4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is really a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of Pagett’s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn’t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived by Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch. He never worried me or got in my way. Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us can move without falling over it. I went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my appearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were listening spellbound to one of Race’s travellers’ tales. I shall label this car not “Sir Eustace Pedler and Party,” but “Colonel Race and Harem.” Then Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every time we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed higher and higher, she snapped at the engine. “You see the point,” she cried delightedly. “It must be some curve if you can photograph the front part of the train from the back, and with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.” I pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly. “I shall write underneath it: ‘Taken from the train. Engine going round a curve.’” “You could write that under any snapshot of a train,” I said. Women never think of these simple things. “I’m glad we’ve come up here in daylight,” cried Anne Beddingfeld. “I shouldn’t have seen this if I’d gone last night to Durban, should I?” “No,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “You’d have waked up to-morrow morning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of stones and rocks.” “I’m glad I changed my mind,” said Anne, sighing contentedly, and looking round. It was rather a wonderful sight. The great mountains all around, through which we turned and twisted and laboured ever steadily upwards. “Is this the best train in the day to Rhodesia?” asked Anne Beddingfeld. “In the day?” laughed Race.",0
"And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark Anzora sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.",0
"They could hardly have been hidden on board and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the Olympia’s arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the Olympia got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.” “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?” “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.",0
"“M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you.",0
"Davenheim left the house?” “About half-past five or thereabouts.” “What lies beyond the rose-garden?” “A lake.” “With a boathouse?” “Yes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you’re thinking of suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don’t mind telling you that Miller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged. That’s the kind of man he is!” Poirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “Hastings, I pray you, hand me that copy of the Daily Megaphone. If I remember rightly, there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.” I rose, and found the sheet required.",0
"""You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply.",0
"’ He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed.",0
"""Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish.",0
"The house and furniture had been sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts. As yet, I had not been successful in finding a post. Not that I really wanted one! I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to be proved in practice. It was early in January the 8th, to be exact. I was returning from an unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a secretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman who would work twelve hours a day for £25 a year.",0
"Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball.",0
"“But there’s a gentleman about who’s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies’ cabins and frighten them.” “How dreadful,” I said, looking alarmed. “He won’t come in here, will he?” “Oh, I don’t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.” “Good night.” I opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight. Drunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents had been wasted.",0
"“It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows.",0
"In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me.",0
"We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there.",0
"“Did you see Sir Eustace?” I asked. “He was marching out of the breakfast room as we went in. He’d had some bad fish or something and was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and he bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was only it wasn’t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.” Suzanne smiled. “Sir Eustace doesn’t like getting up early any more than I do. But, Anne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage. He’s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?” “Only trying to push me overboard,” I replied nonchalantly. It was a distinct score for me.",0
"“It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Grünberg at Marlow and that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s business was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate. No the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt to put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town by no possible means could he have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town.",0
"But if, by any chance, it was not her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings (it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told her as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out (according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession! “In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open.",0
"His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question. “What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen, Mr. Ridgeway?” He laughed rather bitterly. “The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.” “But I understood that it had been opened with a key?” “That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t.",0
"The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death ” Poirot interrupted with a quick question.",0
"""Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?” “Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’” “Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head in and withdrawing it immediately. I stood up. “And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked demurely. Harry came close to me. “My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring his neck. And as for you” “Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited. “I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!” “What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically.",0
"To la femme sentiment is everything is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact.” “Of course, of course,” said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. “Still” He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers. With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman. “Oh, oh, my necklace!” She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round. “Where was it?” demanded Opalsen. “Maid’s bed.",0
"Renauld. It has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young hand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology, is almost certain to fail.” “You’re marvellous, Poirot,” I said, with admiration. “Absolutely marvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!” I think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost embarrassed. “Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound?” His term for Giraud never failed to make me smile. “Rather.",0
"” The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor the case is like this. There must be no reservations. You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might enfin!” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs.",0
"For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something. I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been searching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the half-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my head, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else could there be? I wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had not really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on board previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of the ship’s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why had they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should Cabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place on the Kilmorden Castle. I counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to keep a watch. Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly. “But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.” “Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.",0
"But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe. “Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent omelette, and an equally excellent entrecôte to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length café noir had completed the meal. “Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little salon.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say ” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door.",0
"""Mon ami, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one measuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all important clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping having nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told you so. No” as I was about to interpose a question “we will say no more. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems straightforward enough and yet and yet, mon ami, I am not satisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two hours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in.",0
"On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil! ve confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions.",0
"“To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.” We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests: “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?” “Yes somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think” “That you will need it? It is quite possible.",0
"Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends arriving.” A mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker. “How did you know this address?” I asked as I followed Poirot out into the hall. “Oh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson followed when she left the other flat.” “A la bonne heure, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last. Now for a little surprise for Japp.” Softly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat’s head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing “Miaow.” The Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another man, jumped in spite of himself. “Oh, it’s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!” he exclaimed, as Poirot’s head followed that of the cat.",0
"Only” “Yes?” “Eh bien, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to make up as himself again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right.",0
"“Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see” He paused delicately. “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head. The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us. “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?” She shook her head.",0
"Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.” “If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly. “And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.",0
"In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne’s sympathetic murmurs. (She does that sort of thing very well.) “First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house on purpose to annoy me, I do believe.",0
"The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “Eh bien, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.",0
"” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well. I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did not know how intensely respectable he is I should suspect him of some disreputable amou. I wonder now! Even the most respectable menIt would cheer me up enormously if it was so. Pagett with a guilty secret! Splendid! It has been a curious evening. The only costume that fitted me in the barber’s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear. I don’t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter’s evening in England but it’s hardly an ideal costume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business from both sides. Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair, who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably. Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me. A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but at last they managed it, and a start was made. The mules raced along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.” This, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come from my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious. “My God!” he said anxiously.",0
"to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.” About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street. “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked.",0
"Of course Giraud is all wrong wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not because of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all that I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts not by my leading you by the hand.",0
"Should I mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. “Mrs. Blair, for one,” I said lightly. “A friend of mine with whom I am staying.” “I think not,” said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. “You have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.” His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed, but I was not going to give in without a fight. “You are very clever,” I said. “Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone? Mrs.",0
"She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace’s whole life was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had an acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina removed certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the state of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute fears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina, she was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of questionable things in order to get rich, but women shouldn’t pretend to be in love when they aren’t for ulterior motives. I can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive Nadina.",0
"It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still roll. Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.",0
"She explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a “secret” of far reaching European importance. They had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but Madame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members of the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. On the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to clean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open.",0
"Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so.",0
"I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly.",0
"Renauld will don the tramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave, unnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him. “You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella. Every moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon as he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression that the assassins left that way.",0
"If I have made a mistake” “A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!” He laughed coarsely. “What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police” “Yap, yap, yap like a little toy dog.” He laughed. I sat down on a chair. “I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,” I said coldly. “Indeed?” “I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?” “So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?” Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances.",0
"I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong. When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin fairly early.",0
"There was clearly nothing to be done until I could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long soothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental over him. In her way which of course is quite different from me and Harry she is really fond of Clarence. “I do wish he was here, Anne,” she gulped. “It’s such a long time since I’ve seen him.” “Have some face cream,” I said soothingly. Suzanne rubbed a little on the tip of her charming nose. “I shall want some more face cream soon too,” she remarked, “and you can only get this kind in Paris.” She sighed.",0
"But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, mon ami, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air.",0
"Engine going round a curve.’” “You could write that under any snapshot of a train,” I said. Women never think of these simple things. “I’m glad we’ve come up here in daylight,” cried Anne Beddingfeld. “I shouldn’t have seen this if I’d gone last night to Durban, should I?” “No,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “You’d have waked up to-morrow morning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of stones and rocks.” “I’m glad I changed my mind,” said Anne, sighing contentedly, and looking round. It was rather a wonderful sight.",0
"There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying.",0
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to the sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish, hiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre décors. In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It was the Manager. “Magnificent, petite, magnificent,” he cried. “To-night you have surpassed yourself.” He kissed her gallantly on both cheeks in a somewhat matter-of-fact manner. Madame Nadina accepted the tribute with the ease of long habit and passed on to her dressing-room, where bouquets were heaped carelessly everywhere, marvellous garments of futuristic design hung on pegs, and the air was hot and sweet with the scent of the massed blossoms and with more sophisticated perfumes and essences. Jeanne, the dresser, ministered to her mistress, talking incessantly and pouring out a stream of fulsome compliment. A knock at the door interrupted the flow. Jeanne went to answer it, and returned with a card in her hand. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at the sight of the name on the card, “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a sudden flicker of interest came into her eyes. “I will see him. The maize peignoir, Jeanne, and quickly. And when the Count comes you may go.” “Bien, Madame.” Jeanne brought the peignoir, an exquisite wisp of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to herself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo on the glass of the dressing-table. The Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to him a man of medium height, very slim, very elegant, very pale, extraordinarily weary. In feature, little to take hold of, a man difficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of account. He bowed over the dancer’s hand with exaggerated courtliness. “Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.” So much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind her. Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina’s smile. “Compatriots though we are, we will not speak Russian, I think,” she observed. “Since we neither of us know a word of the language, it might be as well,” agreed her guest. By common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that the Count’s mannerisms had dropped from him, could doubt that it was his native language. He had, indeed, started life as a quick-change music-hall artiste in London. “You had a great success to-night,” he remarked. “I congratulate you.” “All the same,” said the woman, “I am disturbed. My position is not what it was. The suspicions aroused during the War have never died down. I am continually watched and spied upon.” “But no charge of espionage was ever brought against you?” “Our chief lays his plans too carefully for that.” “Long life to the ‘Colonel,’” said the Count, smiling. “Amazing news, is it not, that he means to retire? To retire! Just like a doctor, or a butcher, or a plumber” “Or any other business man,” finished Nadina. “It should not surprise us. That is what the ‘Colonel’ has always been an excellent man of business. He has organized crime as another man might organize a boot factory. Without committing himself, he has planned and directed a series of stupendous coups, embracing every branch of what we might call his ‘profession.’ Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched. Wisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be dangerous? he retires gracefully with an enormous fortune!” “H’m!” said the Count doubtfully. “It is rather upsetting for all of us. We are at a loose end, as it were.” “But we are being paid off on a most generous scale!” Something, some undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her sharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity. But he proceeded diplomatically: “Yes, the ‘Colonel’ has always been a generous paymaster. I attribute much of his success to that and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat. A great brain, undoubtedly a great brain! And an apostle of the maxim, ‘If you want a thing done safely, do not do it yourself!’ Here are we, every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not one of us has anything on him.” He paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with him, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before. “Not one of us,” he mused. “Still, you know, he is superstitious, the old man. Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these fortune-telling people. She prophesied a lifetime of success, but declared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.” He had interested her now. She looked up eagerly. “That is strange, very strange! Through a woman, you say?” He smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “Doubtless, now that he has retired, he will marry. Some young society beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he acquired them.” Nadina shook her head. “No, no, that is not the way of it. Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.” “But your contract here?” “I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will ever know that I have left France. And why do you think that I go?” “Hardly for pleasure at this time of year.",0
"He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities. Your name?” “Gabriel Stonor.” “How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?” “About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met him through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering good boss he was too.” “Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?” “Yes, a good bit.",0
"It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot.",0
"In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me I know what happens in a case of that kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters of law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms. Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there God knows how long. They’ve blown up the railway line already, I hear. It isn’t even as if one could get a drink there. They put the place under martial law two days ago. “My dear fellow,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that I’m studying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study them from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don’t you worry about me. I shall be all right.” “I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already serious.” “A little fasting will improve my figure,” I said, with a sigh. We were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it with amazement: “Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.” I don’t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne. There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young woman she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She has an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don’t see why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the middle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no train, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel’s wings and flown there. And I don’t suppose she will ever explain. Nobody does to me. I always have to guess. It becomes monotonous after a while. The exigencies of journalism are at the bottom of it, I suppose. “How I shot the rapids,” by our Special Correspondent. I refolded the telegram and got rid of my Governmental friend. I don’t like the prospect of being hungry, but I’m not alarmed for my personal safety. Smuts is perfectly capable of dealing with the revolution. But I would give a considerable sum of money for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of whisky with him when he arrives to-morrow? I put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs. The curio-shops in Jo’burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying a window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the shop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race. I can’t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on his accompanying me back to the hotel.",0
"When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong.",0
"Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs. I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction. I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue. I had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor. The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven. The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a cupboard. My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to the lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite window. At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find! I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking. It was just as dusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three days that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any length of time, it would have been thickly coated. Who had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films. I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously. Was the smell of moth balls becoming an obsession with me? I could swear that the roll of films smelt of it also? I held them under my nose. They had, as usual, a strong smell of their own, but apart from that I could clearly detect the odour I disliked so much. I soon found the cause. A minute shred of cloth had caught on a rough edge of the centre wood, and that shred was strongly impregnated with moth balls. At some time or another the films had been carried in the overcoat pocket of the man who was killed in the Tube. Was it he who had dropped them here? Hardly. His movements were all accounted for. No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before. But in that case I must find out the whereabouts of Kilmorden Castle, for to-day was actually the 14th. Three days. Little enough almost hopeless when one had no idea of where to look! It was too late to hand in my roll to-day. I had to hurry home to Kensington so as not to be late for dinner. It occurred to me that there was an easy way of verifying whether some of my conclusions were correct. I asked Mr. Flemming whether there had been a camera amongst the dead man’s belongings. I knew that he had taken an interest in the case and was conversant with all the details. To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera. All Carton’s effects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his state of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind. That was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why should he be carrying a roll of films? I set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be developed. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of each film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my roll.",0
"In an upper room of the Mill House the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday, strangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not been identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.” Nobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited the following facts. Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House.",0
"He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me.",0
"The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing.",0
"The rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out.",0
"There were flowers too. I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly. When it came I enjoyed it. My attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a tall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day. I put him down at once as one of the strong, silent men of Rhodesia. He was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple, and was easily the best-looking man on board. When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my attractive woman was. “That’s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair. You must have read about her in the papers.” I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the polite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him. The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a halt by my chair. “Feeling better this morning?” I thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being. “You did look ill yesterday. Colonel Race and I decided that we should have the excitement of a funeral at sea but you’ve disappointed us.” I laughed. “Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered. “I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.” “About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are but I’ve got another roll.” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly. “Yes, I do feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled. I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was. “That man? Oh, that’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary. Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before. Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him, and the sea’s been too much for both of them. The other fellow hasn’t turned up yet. This man’s name is Pagett.” So Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board. Probably only a coincidence, and yet “That’s Sir Eustace,” my informant continued, “sitting next to the Captain. Pompous old ass.” The more I studied the secretary’s face, the less I liked it. Its even pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously flattened head it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension. Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind him as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied. “My cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir larger.” “I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed. He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton. It was a 17 I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings. 17 1 22 I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle. Supposing I was wrong. When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock something would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time. If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully.",0
"I had the girl’s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn’t got it on you a minute ago?” “Yes, I had,” I replied. “It was in my stocking.” “I don’t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table.",0
"""I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already serious.” “A little fasting will improve my figure,” I said, with a sigh. We were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it with amazement: “Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.” I don’t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne. There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young woman she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She has an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don’t see why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the middle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no train, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel’s wings and flown there.",0
"Then I realized by the pig-tail and the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.” She stopped with a shudder. The butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly. “A gentleman from Mr. Hoffberg’s, m’lord. He says you expect him.” “Good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “I must see him, I suppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.” I drew Poirot aside.",0
"""Well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of auburn” “Always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!” murmured Poirot. “But continue.” “Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and well, that’s all, I think,” I concluded lamely. “And her husband?” “Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow nothing startling.” “Dark or fair?” “I don’t know betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of face.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, there are hundreds of these average men and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.",0
"The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid a master stroke, ça!” “But what did you go to London for?” “You remember the card?” “Certainly. It puzzled me and puzzles me still. I thought” I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. “Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints. I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method” “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted. “But where did their ‘method’ break down?” “Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark” “I remember,” I cried. “Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!” There was a moment’s silence. “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me. “This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed. “Pas du tout,” replied Poirot tranquilly. “Japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them. But” he tapped his pocket “I have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you, my friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we return here next week-end at my expense this time?” Now that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I think I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe. One evening after dinner I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation” was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand. I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. “Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England’s Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention. “In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!” He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a how do you call it? ‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.” I laughed. “At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.” “I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate MacAdam?” “Enfantillage!” replied Poirot promptly. “One can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.” “It was very near succeeding this time,” I reminded him. Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him. “They won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very important.” “Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed.",0
"Renauld’s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to take them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame Renauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart. That night, M.

"I can alter my appearance a little wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window.",0
"We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and worry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth order. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and above-board, eh bien, méfiez vous! It is, how do you say it? cooked! The great criminal is simple but very few criminals are great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably betray themselves. Ah, mon ami, I would that some day I could meet a really great criminal one who commits his crime, and then does nothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.” But I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me. “Poirot! Mrs.",0
"""They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t think for an instant” Poirot raised his hand. “Tout doucement, mon ami. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see” Poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed to be amusing him vastly. “And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!” “What on earth” “And stars give light! Voilà! Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.",0
"""He was supposed to be in Florence but he certainly never went there. I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved. Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle_ that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the devil Carton hid them if he did hide them, I don’t know.” “That’s another story,” I quoted. “My story. And I’m going to tell it you now.” Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been in my possession or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in her own brain, and the “Colonel” was not likely to guess that they had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward! Harry’s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured. It was the other, graver charge that paralyzed all our activities. For, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove his case. The one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity of the “Colonel.” Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett? “I should say he was but for one thing,” said Harry. “It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Grünberg at Marlow and that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s business was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate. No the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt to put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town by no possible means could he have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town. He might, of course, have cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who could have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of that note being written.",0
"“I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race.",0
"We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn’t her game. Sometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn’t been, for Sir Laurence Eardsley’s only son was quite a parti. But the truth of it was that she was married to a sorter in De Beers’ though nobody knew of it.",0
"On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck. I think it was a “witch”!  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Mount Nelson Hotel,  Cape Town. It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden.",0
"He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her. And at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she had a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone. He is a strange man. One doesn’t notice it so much in a crowd. But, when one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do. It was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft yellow brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent except our car which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing about engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be in its interior. By and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders appeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel Race. “There must have been giants once,” I said dreamily. “And their children were just like children are to-day they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long well, it makes one what you would call cruel. One comes to hold life and death very lightly.” “Yes,” I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do though they are, I suppose. That is, they are nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength like lions and tigers” “And giraffes?” interpolated Colonel Race slyly. I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same one feels the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. “Better lift you,” he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture. I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of me, staring into my face. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he said abruptly. “I’m a gipsy seeing the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext. You’ve not the soul of the journalist. You’re out for your own hand snatching at life. But that’s not all.” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I said slowly, “that you are really connected with the Government that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden again. No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of them all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I offered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously. I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it. “Oh,” I cried indignantly, “they’re starved! It’s wicked. Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t don’t,” I said fiercely. “I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not. You see I care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?” “No,” I whispered. “It was since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand and it frightened me. We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. “Alias the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there was something more behind. “You haven’t caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.” “It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves or some one walking over my grave. I keep feeling something dreadful’s going to happen.” “Don’t be silly,” said Suzanne, with decision. “Let’s talk of something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills. I loved it loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there always always. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home. Home! And yet I had never been here before or had I in dreams? We walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely wired against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We went out on the stoep and I uttered a gasp. There, half a mile away, facing us, were the Falls. I’ve never seen anything so grand and beautiful I never shall. “Anne, you’re fey,” said Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch. “I’ve never seen you like this before.” She stared at me curiously. “Am I?” I laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. “It’s just that I love it all.” “It’s more than that.” A little frown creased her brow one of apprehension. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something something that would happen soon. I was excited restless. After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge. It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls their elusive quality. You always think you’re going to see and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.",0
"It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter.",0
"“And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!” “What on earth” “And stars give light! Voilà! Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.” I accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot addressed himself: “Pardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?” The porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out: “No. 4. Second floor.” “I thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?” “Six months.” I started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirot’s malicious grin. “Impossible,” I cried. “You must be making a mistake.” “Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.” He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside. “Eh bien, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?” I did not reply. Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going. “To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.” We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests: “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?” “Yes somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think” “That you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.” The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher. The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below. “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.” I craned my neck over the staircase. “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper. “Good. Wait awhile.” About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat. “C’est ça. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.” “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily. Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift. “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us. The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot.",0
"Because, after all, honeymoons don’t last forever you’re not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a little wild-cat Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but one day you will suddenly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane, sumptuous furs, Paris frocks, the largest thing in motors and the latest thing in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses! Oh, yes, you will! But have your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and let it be a long one.",0
"The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know.",0
"“Voilà! Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The sergent de ville saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me.",0
"To most people it would have been a treat but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a nice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on.",0
"The “Colonel” and his gang must have no suspicion that there existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I knew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to Lord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer “Nadina” who had been delighting Paris for so long. It seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified already but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw how natural it really was. Nadina had never been to England during her successful career in Paris.",0
"“Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in getting the case dismissed but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer. He cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father’s disbelief.",0
"Now, for the first time, he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free but in order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation. And then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was. Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence, and admitted that the “Russians” were a pure invention on her part. The real murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had committed the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had consented also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime. But she had steadfastly refused to have anything more to do with her husband’s murderer, and it was in revenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter accusing her. She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with the planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night to find Georges Conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in his hand. It was a touch and go affair. Madame Beroldy’s story was hardly credible. But this woman, whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been so easily accepted, had the supreme art of making herself believed. Her address to the jury was a masterpiece. The tears streaming down her face, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. She admitted that, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime but, before God, nothing more! She knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to the law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.… She had loved him! Could she let her hand be the one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but she was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her. However that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day. Madame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was acquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau was never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her. Taking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life. I have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here. Nevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the English papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details. Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole matter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance. The remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot’s point of view struck me at once. “Poirot,” I said, “I congratulate you. I see everything now.” “If that is indeed the truth, I congratulate you, mon ami. For as a rule you are not famous for seeing eh, is it not so?” I felt a little annoyed. “Come now, don’t rub it in. You’ve been so confoundedly mysterious all along with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might fail to see what you were driving at.” Poirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then he looked up. “And since you see everything now, mon ami, what exactly is it that you see?” “Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld. The similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.” “Then you consider that Madame Beroldy was wrongly acquitted? That in actual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband’s murder?” I opened my eyes wide. “But of course! Don’t you?” Poirot walked to the end of the room, absentmindedly straightened a chair, and then said thoughtfully. “Yes, that is my opinion. But there is no ‘of course’ about it, my friend. Technically speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.” “Of that crime, perhaps. But not of this.” Poirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked than ever. “So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil murdered M. Renauld?” “Yes.” “Why?” He shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback. “Why?” I stammered. “Why? Oh, because ” I came to a stop. Poirot nodded his head at me. “You see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame Daubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld? We can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death; considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You cannot have a murder without a motive. The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the crime passionnel is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.",0
"But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily.",0
"Harper was saying, “I’ve only been six months with the expedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner’s affairs pretty well.” “Can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?” “He turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I’d never met him before, but some of the others had Ames, I think, and Schneider. The old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. They were at it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘Not a cent,’ the old man shouted. ‘Not one cent now or when I’m dead. I intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my life’s work. I’ve been talking it over with Mr.",0
"I have said nothing all these years, I have been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but now matters are different. I want my price and it will be a big, I might almost say a staggering price.” “Extraordinary,” said the Count. “And doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you everywhere?” His eyes roamed gently round the disordered room. Nadina laughed softly. “You need suppose nothing of the sort. I am not a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will dream of looking for them.",0
"""Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do not like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little ideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your only chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came for the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.” “He was not a count,” growled the Italian. “I have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the Almanach de Gotha. Never mind, the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing.” “I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.” “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning that is so, is it not?” “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.” “Pardon, how was it paid?” “In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.” “Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?” “In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with the man.” “And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?” “I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.” Poirot looked at him and shook his head. “Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.” After bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me. “Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?” “Well, I suppose Ascanio is right somebody impersonated him.” “Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. Ça vous dit quelque chose? I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black.",0
"""Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together?” “I don’t quite understand you?” “I will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?” The doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment. “You’re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you’ve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk?” “Absolute nonsense,” muttered Willard angrily. Poirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his green cat’s eyes. “So you do not believe it, monsieur le docteur?” “No, sir, I do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “I am a scientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.",0
"""I have reappeared again,” I told him solemnly. “And how are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Very well, thank you looking forward to taking up my work again with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I said, “there is something I want to ask you. I hope that you won’t be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you can possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow on the 8th of January last?” He started violently. “Really, Miss Beddingfeld I indeed” “You were there, weren’t you?” “I for reasons of my own I was in the neighbourhood, yes.” “Won’t you tell me what those reasons were?” “Sir Eustace has not already told you?” “Sir Eustace? Does he know?” “I am almost sure that he does.",0
"Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize ” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully. “All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study.",0
"“It is queer, isn’t it? You don’t think that that the place is haunted?” “Never heard of a haunted flat,” declared Parker decisively. “N-o.” Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. “But there were several things about it all that struck me as well, queer.” “For instance” I suggested. “Ah,” said Parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused! Unburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries.” I laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle thrust upon me.",0
"Then a voice behind me made me start: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m just going down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I said hastily. “But there’s no need to trouble you. I” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.” I was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said coldly. We all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. “I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he observed.",0
"“I must have been very drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed. Take my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you, don’t go on the bust again.” “As you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.” “Much wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I haven’t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I said thoughtfully. “She wants to get to Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I’ve a good mind to offer her a temporary job as a secretary.",0
"” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem.",0
"The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",0
"“This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk. “Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.” Poirot laughed. “The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘Tiens! The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back.",0
"Blair without Colonel Race,” Pagett interposed. “He’s asked her to dine with him, I know.” Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. “Who is Race?” I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. “They say he’s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don’t know for certain.” “Isn’t that like the Government?” I exclaimed. “Here’s a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone.” Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice.",0
"” The case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb of Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomb a belief which, as Poirot pointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought. “Poirot,” I said, “a change of air would do you good.” “You think so, mon ami?” “I am sure of it.” “Eh eh?” said my friend, smiling. “It is all arranged, then?” “You will come?” “Where do you propose to take me?” “Brighton.",0
"""Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “Mon ami! Vive l’amour! It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!” After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned. Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being. But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act but I could not rest easy in my mind. Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what your plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.” “But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France without delay.” “We?” “Precisely ‘we!’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish ” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard which every one would perceive, bien entendu I much prefer that we should voyage together. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you ” “I know I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still ” I began, and stopped. “Still as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.",0
"So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection: “Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will doubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that Madame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had taken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me ” I saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice: “I shall not contradict you. It is possible.” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back. “M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried. “Yes, but I forbid ” “My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of Mr. Renauld.” “My Friend: “You will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out with struggling. “You will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever, to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn’t for myself I did it that’s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself. “I’ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her. I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me.",0
"Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound and you are a dead man, remember.’ “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.” “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?” “None whatever, monsieur.” “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?” “Yes. I had seen the change in him.",0
"However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need.",0
"She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious whirl and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me. It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa. They passed to Europe” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood. I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.” “I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one.",0
"What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him. On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent Bridge players and one decent-looking woman Mrs. Clarence Blair.",0
"I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help.",0
"I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands.",0
"22. The thing I don’t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer instinct.” “And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?” “My dear Anne, you don’t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar.",0
"Poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words: “Key of Roll Top Desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys. “An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is also a young lady of method and order.” Baker came in answer to the bell. “Will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?” Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs.",0
"“This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside.

"I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved.",0
"” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.” “He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “Dear M. Poirot: “If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid.",0
"He persuaded me to come over to his side.” Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. “Rats always leaving a sinking ship,” observed Sir Eustace. “I don’t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they’re in the big giraffe’s stomach.",0
"Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with three people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.",0
"Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up.",0
"My Romantic Wedding was given a halo of publicity. My son is lying in the sun, kicking his legs. There’s a “man in a brown suit” if you like. He’s wearing as little as possible, which is the best costume for Africa, and is as brown as a berry. He’s always burrowing in the earth. I think he takes after Papa. He’ll have that same mania for Pleiocene clay. Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.” Strangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion. Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess! It was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective, Hercule Poirot. The Calais express was singularly empty in fact, my own compartment held only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace. “Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an imaginary audience. “I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but Oh, Lord, there’s reason enough for it! Do you know I’ve lost my only sister?” “Really?” I said politely. “How unfortunate.” “He disapproves!” remarked the lady. “He disapproves utterly of me, and my sister which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!” I opened my mouth, but she forestalled me. “Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo! I am crushed!” She buried herself behind a large comic French paper.",0
"But she is the kind of young woman who does these things. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into my private car! I am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He might just have got off by Monday’s train. They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that says little. He’s an astute young man and he knows Africa. He’s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman and the simple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a scar, dressed in the height of European fashion.",0
"What had happened to his usually keen wits? “They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.” “Tiens!” cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration. “But your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.” I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.",0
"But I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so. “Tiens! A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this charming young lady?” I had to confess that I did not know. “Still more romantic! The first rencontre in the train from Paris, the second here. Journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the saying?” “Don’t be an ass, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!” “It’s all very well to rag me.",0
"He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two.",0
"The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. “What?” I cried, startled. Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the street. Pagett had followed him. “And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!” “What?” “Yes, Sir Eustace. And that’s not all. I’ve been making inquiries about her” “Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?” “He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop” I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly. “Nothing,” I said. “Go on.",0
"Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.” “O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?” “Yes, he is an Irishman.” “From what part of Ireland?” “County Clare, I believe.” “Tiens! But proceed, milord.” “The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual.",0
"If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!” “Do not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are not so easily parted. Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out a tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.” I acknowledged the wisdom of this. “In any case,” continued Poirot, “it is not the money which attracts me here. Certainly it will be pleasant to have carte blanche in our investigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest. You remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?” I considered.",0
"There’s a sort of deft professional callousness that this man hadn’t got. Besides, a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.” “He did that?” “Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time except that I felt there was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.” “H’m,” said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and paper. “In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.” “Doesn’t sound likely to me,” said the inspector.",0
"She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room God! It was horrible. Dead and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in.",0
"""But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.",0
"They’re only acquaintances really even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must have known a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.” I managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all. “If you would be guided by me” he said, hesitating. “I don’t expect I shall be,” I answered candidly. “But there’s no harm in hearing.” “Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted.",0
"We were cut off from the world, alone together as Adam and Eve might have been but with what a difference! Old Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have done. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much of it as I could manage with one arm. Harry was out a good part of the time, but we spent long hours together lying out in the shade of the palms, talking and quarrelling discussing everything under high heaven, quarrelling and making it up again. We bickered a good deal, but there grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I could never have believed possible. That and something else.",0
"I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them.",0
"I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject, probably not, and in any case he would not have been interested. The opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest degree. I think it was really a sign of his greatness. In the same way, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life. He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never seemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every important society, and had rows of letters after his name, the general public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned books, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge, had no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee. The young of the human race show some anthropoid features, whereas the young of the chimpanzee approach more nearly to the human than the adult chimpanzee does. That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were more Simian than we are, the chimpanzee’s were of a higher type than the present species in other words, the chimpanzee is a degenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the Daily Budget, being hard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with large headlines. “We are not descended from monkeys, but are monkeys descended from us? Eminent Professor says chimpanzees are decadent humans.” Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the moment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question. I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the Daily Budget. However, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely put on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer. The reporter from the Daily Budget was the only young man who ever came to our house. There were times when I envied Emily, our little servant, who “walked out” whenever occasion offered with a large sailor to whom she was affianced. In between times, to “keep her hand in” as she expressed it, she walked out with the greengrocer’s young man, and the chemist’s assistant. I reflected sadly that I had no one to “keep my hand in” with. All Papa’s friends were aged Professors usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a “neat little waist” and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a “neat little waist” since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always “felled their opponent with a single blow.” There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could “fell” an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela.” Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair. She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious whirl and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me. It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa. They passed to Europe” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood. I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros.",0
"” For answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket an ancient tattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans. Then, wheeling round, he strode out of the tent. The doctor stared at me. “What is his little idea?” The phrase, so familiar on Poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came from another. “I don’t know exactly,” I confessed. “He’s got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.” I went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced young man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner’s secretary. “No,” Mr.",0
"Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me. I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face. I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on. It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling. Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew. The murder in the house at Marlow was not an isolated incident committed by a solitary individual. I was up against a gang, and, thanks to Colonel Race’s revelations to Suzanne, and what I had overheard at the house at Muizenberg, I was beginning to understand some of its manifold activities. Systematized crime, organized by the man known to his followers as the “Colonel”! I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the strike on the Rand and the causes underlying it and the belief that some secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation. That was the “Colonel’s” work, his emissaries were acting according to plan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard, as he limited himself to directing and organizing. The brain-work not the dangerous labour for him. But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently impeccable position. That, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race’s presence on the Kilmorden Castle. He was out after the arch-criminal. Everything fitted in with that assumption. He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that. In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger! Some knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them anxious to remove me at all costs and that knowledge was bound up somehow with the diamonds. There was one person, I felt sure, who could enlighten me if he would! The Man in the Brown Suit Harry Rayburn. He knew the other half of the story. But he had vanished into the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit. In all probability he and I would never meet again. I brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment. It was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn. He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first.",0
"""You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired.",0
"I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner. He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets.",0
"“Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile. “I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question. “What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen, Mr. Ridgeway?” He laughed rather bitterly. “The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.” “But I understood that it had been opened with a key?” “That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t. And, in the end, they must have got it unlocked somehow or other.” “Curious,” said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light I knew so well. “Very curious! They waste much, much time trying to prise it open, and then sapristi! they find that they have the key all the time for each of Hubbs’s locks are unique.” “That’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. It never left me day or night.” “You are sure of that?” “I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?” “Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?” Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated apologetically. “Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?” “Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!” “And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?” “Certainly they did.",0
"I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily. “Where the devil did she go to that night, that’s what I’d like to know.” “She was on the island all the time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man on it?” “Yes.” “How very improper,” I said. “Pagett will be quite shocked. He always did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld. I suppose that was the young man she originally intended to meet in Durban?” “I don’t think so.” “Don’t tell me anything you don’t want to,” I said, by way of encouraging him. “I fancy that this is a young man we should all be very glad to lay our hands on.” “Not?” I cried, in rising excitement. He nodded. “Harry Rayburn, alias Harry Lucas that’s his real name, you know. He’s given us all the slip once more, but we’re bound to rope him in soon.” “Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying. Without stopping to reflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading statements, I gave myself up to the pleasure of scoring off Race. He is always so cocksure. I took the telegram from my pocket and handed it to him. “Then how do you explain this?” I asked nonchalantly. He seemed dumbfounded. “She said she was just starting for Beira,” he said, in a dazed voice. I know that Race is supposed to be clever. He is, in my opinion, rather a stupid man. It never seemed to occur to him that girls do not always tell the truth. “Kimberley too. What are they doing there?” he muttered. “Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the Daily Budget.” “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared.",0
"What could one do with a man like that? “Of course, if it’s so dreadful that you’d be ashamed to speak of it to me” I began spitefully. At last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed. “Dreadful? Ashamed? I don’t understand you.” “Then tell me.” In three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett’s secret! It was not in the least what I expected. I walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me. I tore it open.",0
"” Everybody has been at me, right and left, to write this story from the great (represented by Lord Nasby) to the small (represented by our late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in England. “Lor’, miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all just like the pictures!”). I’ll admit that I’ve certain qualifications for the task. I was mixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick of it all through, and I was triumphantly “in at the death.",0
"It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you ” “I know I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still ” I began, and stopped. “Still as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing.",0
"“Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You in company with a friend visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th” The Italian made an angry gesture. “I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court” “Précisément and I have a little idea that you have sworn falsely.” “You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.” “Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you but with publicity.",0
"All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full, stood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar, the other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding cigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table. I enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I wondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked him. “Mon ami,” he replied, “you miss the point. I am looking for something that I do not see.",0
"When he had finished, she drew a long breath. “But you are wonderful magnificent! You are the greatest detective in the world.” With a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French. “Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so. Oh, save him, save him save him!” We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us.",0
"According to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour to-day and would be almost on time, though he was extremely doubtful whether it would ever get through to Johannesburg. The line had been blown up, so he solemnly assured me. It sounded cheerful! The train drew in just ten minutes late. Everybody tumbled out on the platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no difficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his usual nervous start at seeing me somewhat accentuated this time. “Dear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.",0
"Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here and here ” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have been careful to obliterate them but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?” “Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable.",0
"They passed to Europe” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood.",0
"Seeing as he was in a great to-do and with all that quite the gentleman I brought up ’is card.” She handed me the bit of pasteboard. “Mr. Roger Havering,” I read. Poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently pulled forth “Who’s Who.” Poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly. “Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb.” “H’m!” I said. “I rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at the Frivolity only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember she married some young man about town just before the War.",0
"Owing to the fact that an itinerary of the great man’s daily proceedings had just been published, I knew exactly where to find him at this moment. It was his hour for dictating to his secretary in his own house. I did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to come and ask for him would be at once admitted to the august presence. But I had attended to that side of the matter. In the card-tray in the hall of the Flemmings’ house I had observed the card of the Marquis of Loamsley, England’s most famous sporting peer. I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs, and pencilled upon it the words: “Please give Miss Beddingfeld a few moments of your time.",0
"""And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course.",0
"Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.",0
"With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent omelette, and an equally excellent entrecôte to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length café noir had completed the meal.",0
"as practically the middle of the day “and I thought that under the circumstances” He tapped the telegram again. “What is that thing?” I asked. “It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been murdered in your house.” That aroused me in earnest. “What colossal cheek,” I exclaimed. “Why in my house? Who murdered her?” “They don’t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once, Sir Eustace?” “You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?” “The police” “What on earth have I to do with the police?” “Well, it was your house.” “That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.",0
"Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure. “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew.",0
"“I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!” I pondered the matter. “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. Bonne mère, très femme!” “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.",0
"“Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it and the wonder, I shall not forget no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “Mon ami,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well.",0
"Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal paymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run no risk of the hangman’s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their affair.” “Then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?” Poirot made a gesture of anger.",0
"We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?” “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.” “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.",0
"But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. Sacré! if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.",0
"A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.” “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?” “My dear sir, I never attended him.” “What?” “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist or something of that kind.” “But you examined the body?” “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.” “And the cause of death was clear?” “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.” “Was he still lying where he had been found?” “Yes, the body had not been touched.",0
"He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.” “No question of his having been shot, eh?” “My dear sir!” “I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!” “You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr.",0
"But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself. I just drifted, in fact not realizing that I was driving the poor kid desperate. If she’d really knifed me, as she meant to, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she’s come forward now is downright plucky. I’d have stood the racket, you know up to the end.” He was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack: “What gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in underclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. I suppose he’d just given the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a mistake about its being 2 o’clock when they came. Or or, it wasn’t all a frame up, was it? I mean, my mother didn’t think couldn’t think that that it was me?” Poirot reassured him quickly. “No, no, M. Jack. Have no fears on that score. As for the rest, I will explain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you recount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?” “There’s very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in order to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The train was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf links. I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there. I had nearly reached the place when ” He paused and swallowed. “Yes?” “I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud a sort of choke and gasp but it frightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came round the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then and then I looked up and saw her. She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost it’s what she must have thought me at first all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes.",0
"Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station.",0
"“The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “Bien,” said Bex.",0
"The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed.",0
"“Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the end his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he scrawled those four desperate words.” But my friend shook his head energetically. “You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?” “Well?” I said puzzled. “Mon Dieu, mon ami, but use your little grey cells! Is it not obvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it carefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last words, and blotted the sheet.",0
"The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain. “He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly. “You know me?” Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures. How should I not know you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.” “You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!” said my friend grandiloquently. “It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.” “We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge. “The injury is serious, then?” I asked. “What injury?” “The bullet wound.” “Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.” “As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.” “There has been a second attempt, then?” “Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has disappeared.” “What?” “He has been kidnapped!” “Impossible!” I cried, stupefied. Poirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut. “Unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,” continued his lordship. Poirot looked at Mr. Dodge. “You said just now, monsieur, that time was everything. What did you mean by that?” The two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said: “You have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied Conference?” My friend nodded. “For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow Thursday evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.” Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?” “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.” “And the Conference is to be held?” “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.” Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket. “It is now a quarter to nine.” “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully. “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur it may come in useful. Now for the details the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?” “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.” “Eh bien?” “Well, they started from Boulogne but they never arrived.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.” “And the bogus car?” “Is still at large.” Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?” “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible but nothing has been discovered!” At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.” The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew. “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” “And they have found nothing else?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.” “If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.",0
"So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld.",0
"He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course.",0
"""Any trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good terms?” “I should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful. Mrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a nonentity, I think.” “Then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had he any enemies?” “He had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular good-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him and, if they had, where is the body?” “Exactly.",0
"Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I’m tired of secretaries, I won’t have any more secretaries. Either they’re concealed murderers or else they’re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have.",0
"Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot.",0
"I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",0
"But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act but I could not rest easy in my mind.",0
"""But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow.",0
"“Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.",0
"I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace.",0
"” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back.",0
"Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but ma foi! I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing.",0
"Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.",0
"Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared the woman. “Cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.” Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms. “Two?” said Poirot sharply. “Yes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil one and sure enough, so he did do.",0
"” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if ” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so.",0
"My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.",0
"Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.",0
"Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.",0
"I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service.",0
"“When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” “When I began to work the right way from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a mind like mine!” The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received.",0
"Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory.",0
"“That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death. I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions. All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly. Pagett is staying behind here you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia which is very annoying, because I want to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted. “I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town. I can alter my appearance a little wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window. Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard. You wouldn’t like me to come with you, would you?” “I should love it.” “Nice girl. Sure you won’t change your mind and come and look for lions in Rhodesia?” “Quite sure.” “He must be a very handsome fellow,” said Sir Eustace plaintively. “Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station.” “Oh, no, thank you,” I said hastily. “Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered.” To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!” “What has he done now?” I inquired with some curiosity. “He’s got hold of a secretary for me. You never saw such a woman! Forty, if she’s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular slab-faced woman.” “Won’t she hold your hand?” “I devoutly hope not!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “That would be the last straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan’t give you the skin after the base way you’ve deserted me.” He squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for me in the hall. She was to come down to see me off. “Let’s start at once,” I said hastily, and motioned to the man to get a taxi. Then a voice behind me made me start: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m just going down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I said hastily. “But there’s no need to trouble you. I” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.” I was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said coldly. We all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. “I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he observed. “Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively. We pulled up in front of the station. Here surely he would leave us. I turned with outstretched hand but no. “I’ll come and see you off. It’s just eight o’clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.” He gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train. And what could I do? Nothing. I saw myself, in a quarter of an hour’s time, steaming out of the station with Pagett planted on the platform waving me adieu. He had turned the tables on me adroitly. His manner towards me had changed, moreover. It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat ill upon him, and which nauseated me. The man was an oily hypocrite. First he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments! Did he imagine for one minute that I hadn’t recognized him that night on the boat? No, it was a pose, a pose which he forced me to acquiesce in, his tongue in his cheek all the while. Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment I had a two-berth one to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the train would start. But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well. She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him. She is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow. Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me. I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face. I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on. It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling. Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew. The murder in the house at Marlow was not an isolated incident committed by a solitary individual. I was up against a gang, and, thanks to Colonel Race’s revelations to Suzanne, and what I had overheard at the house at Muizenberg, I was beginning to understand some of its manifold activities.",0
"As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot. “How would it be if you went on first to break the news to my mother that I am free ” “While you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?” finished Poirot, with a twinkle. “But yes, by all means, I was about to propose such an arrangement myself.” Jack Renauld did not wait for more. Stopping the car, he swung himself out, and ran up the path to the front door. We went on in the car to the Villa Geneviève. “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember how we arrived here that first day? And were met by the news of M. Renauld’s murder?” “Ah! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have happened since then especially for you, mon ami!” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The mise en scène designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the dénouement ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old woman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the salon. It was some time before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave. “Vous voilà, Hastings! Sacré tonnerre, but there are squalls ahead!” “What do you mean?” I cried. “I would hardly have credited it,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “but women are very unexpected.” “Here are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,” I exclaimed, looking out of the window. Poirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps outside. “Do not enter. It is better not. Your mother is very upset.” “I know, I know,” said Jack Renauld. “I must go up to her at once.” “But no, I tell you. It is better not.” “But Marthe and I ” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s arm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was weeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs. Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward.",0
"And observe that ‘Peerage’ how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, method, which, as I have often told you, Hastings” “Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place. Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality. “Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too.",0
"My idea was to go at once to the Magnificent, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly. In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them. I gave way unwillingly.",0
"We will dismiss the thin air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore” “Yes, but we know” “You may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since it seemed incredible, it was incredible. Two possibilities remain: it was hidden on board also rather difficult or it was thrown overboard.” “With a cork on it, do you mean?” “Without a cork.” I stared. “But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been sold in New York.",0
"But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head.",0
"We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.” By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal. “Vite, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!” Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.",0
"“It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute.",0
"You never saw such a woman! Forty, if she’s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular slab-faced woman.” “Won’t she hold your hand?” “I devoutly hope not!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “That would be the last straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan’t give you the skin after the base way you’ve deserted me.” He squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for me in the hall. She was to come down to see me off. “Let’s start at once,” I said hastily, and motioned to the man to get a taxi.",0
"Count Foscatini. There’s been an accident there, I understand.” The man stared at him. “First I’ve heard of it. Mr. Graves that’s Count Foscatini’s man went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.” “Is the Count alone in the flat?” “No, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.” “What are they like?” I asked eagerly. We were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on which Flat II was situated. “I didn’t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were foreign gentlemen.” He pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing. No. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell.",0
"Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman.",0
"""Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again in any other disguise, I mean?” asked Suzanne. I shook my head ruefully. “I certainly didn’t recognize him as the stewardess, and never should have but for your drawing.” “The man’s a professional actor, I’m sure of it,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “His make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you’d never spot him.” “You’re very cheering,” I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. “What is Sir Eustace doing?” asked Suzanne. “I haven’t seen him about to-day.",0
"Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",0
"""But I demand pardon if I am dense, madame surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?” A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older. “I want to wear it down there.” “Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?” “That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly.",0
"“Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain.",0
"Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got lots of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement. “Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!_” Diamonds! I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. “Are you sure, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear. I’ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts. They’re beauties too, Anne and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me. Was it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for my benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately “pumped.” For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in? What possible connection could he have with the affair? “Who is Colonel Race?” I asked. “That’s rather a question,” said Suzanne. “He’s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this trip. He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be rolling. You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence my husband, you know. It’s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.” “It must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like you.” “Well, I’m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and goes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married even to Clarence!” I disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all. Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.” “But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow. She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow. What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It looks as though he had some hold over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested in spite of myself. “You don’t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he’s a most capable and hard-working young man. And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.” “What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know but a scar can be faked easily enough.",0
"” There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could “fell” an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela.” Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair.",0
"A secret meeting for orders!” “Don’t hiss at me, Pagett,” I said, drawing back a little, “and do control your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. “Something was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.” “You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only part of the story that he wasn’t vague about.",0
"You always think you’re going to see and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along.",0
"What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there.",0
"“Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.",0
"” Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully. “Si, si, mon enfant I assure you it is better not to resist.” Then he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little experiment purely for my own satisfaction.” “Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally. Poirot addressed Célestine once more. “You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it?” “On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.” “And the scissors?” “They also.",0
"“Do you know, I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?” “You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.” “But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?” “Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did yes but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.” “What?” “Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away.",0
"""Have you the will or a copy of it with you?” Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it, nodding to himself. “Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also 11 a.m. that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made even half-an-hour later would upset this. Eh bien, mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you.",0
"” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you ” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed.",0
"He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment maman called me from the house, and I had to go. That is all, only I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.’ Now, Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not see Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?” “Surely, Poirot,” I cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like that would murder his own father.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe anything.” “And the motive?” “Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come in to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.” “But the tramp. Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.” “And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.” “Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs.",0
"I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.” “Pardon, how was it paid?” “In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.” “Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?” “In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with the man.” “And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?” “I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.” Poirot looked at him and shook his head. “Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.” After bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me. “Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?” “Well, I suppose Ascanio is right somebody impersonated him.” “Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. Ça vous dit quelque chose? I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini’s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?” I shook my head, utterly bewildered. “Come, I will help you. What evidence have we that Ascanio and his friend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that night? Nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. We have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.” “You mean?” “I mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. Ah, but it was a clever idea! Graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a man of method! He overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning, enough to realize that Ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself. The following evening, about eight o’clock, he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone. Foscatini sits down, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind Graves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to the service telephone dinner for three! It comes, he lays the table, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to get rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a resolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos, the rice soufflé is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion. Ah, but it was magnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry. So successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from Flat II at that time.” “Except Hercule Poirot, I suppose?” I said sarcastically. “Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.” Poirot was right. He always is, confound him! The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the following day. She arrived punctually a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour. “My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,” she began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.” “If you please, mademoiselle.” “I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist.",0
"I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean the opposite?” “Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.” “Brachycephalic,” I murmured unwillingly. “That’s it. I thought that was what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said with all the assurance I could muster. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she laughed. “You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.",0
"He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly. “I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track and, my God! that’s the place to know a friend. There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death could have broken. Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were crowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles. I can’t tell you our elation. It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.” “Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then in the hotel at Kimberley we met her” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard.",0
"By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle, which left Cape Town in two days’ time. I had just time to journey down and catch the same boat. “I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board. I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge, and it was comparatively easy for me to transform myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age. I avoided Carton carefully on board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under the pretence of illness. “I had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London. He went straight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day. He left the hotel shortly before one o’clock. I was behind him. He went straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying. It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House. I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton. I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner.",0
"” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair.",0
"It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was Harry Rayburn.",0
"“I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?” “Mon ami I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering Léonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I decided on the latter. So I made my guess and I was right.” “And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?” Poirot smiled. “At any rate I saw that she had anxious eyes.",0
"“And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er the Madonna er Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So picturesque on the banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered.",0
"Pagett from their position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind. I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary.",0
"“What is it?” “The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?” “No, I didn’t.” “You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore false to all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I asked, not particularly interested in Poirot’s principles.",0
"Confound the fellow and his prowling ways. Altogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast with poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of getting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired. Later. A very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray’s sealed letter. It didn’t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper! Now, I suppose, I’m in the devil of a mess.",0
My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship.,0
"Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if ” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they were. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.” We could say no more, for the old man had joined us. “You want me for something, monsieur?” “Yes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven’t you?” “Twenty-four years, monsieur.” “And your name is ?” “Auguste, monsieur.” “I was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb. They have been planted long?” “Some time, monsieur. But of course, to keep the beds looking smart, one must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that are over, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.” “You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired. Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize ” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully.",0
"As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency.” “By the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French window of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a good way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot fix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as the gardeners cease work at that time.” “And Mr.",0
"” I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck. As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.” “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.” “What?” “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.” He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending. He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?” His eyes challenged us. “But I Hercule Poirot tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within here!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot so and I say: the Prime Minister is there! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.” And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously contemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness. Finally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the window. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned for my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the daily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay alongside the quay. Suddenly I was aroused by Poirot’s voice close to my elbow.",0
"By common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that the Count’s mannerisms had dropped from him, could doubt that it was his native language. He had, indeed, started life as a quick-change music-hall artiste in London. “You had a great success to-night,” he remarked. “I congratulate you.” “All the same,” said the woman, “I am disturbed. My position is not what it was. The suspicions aroused during the War have never died down. I am continually watched and spied upon.” “But no charge of espionage was ever brought against you?” “Our chief lays his plans too carefully for that.” “Long life to the ‘Colonel,’” said the Count, smiling.",0
"I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution.",0
"I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but at last they managed it, and a start was made. The mules raced along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.” This, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come from my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious. “My God!” he said anxiously. “Who un’arnessed them?” “I must go to Rhodesia,” said Mrs. Blair. “After what you have told us, Colonel Race, I simply must. It’s a horrible journey though, five days in the train.” “You must join me on my private car,” I said gallantly. “Oh, Sir Eustace, how sweet of you, do you really mean it?” “Do I mean it!” I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass of champagne. “Just about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,” sighed Mrs. Blair. “Ah, South Africa,” I said sentimentally, and began to quote from a recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. “What has South Africa to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms, her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and her diamonds” I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of the miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist. However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. “Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld. They both addressed Colonel Race. “I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?” I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time. Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so on. Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject. He described the methods of housing the natives, the searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers took. “Then it’s practically impossible to steal any diamonds?” asked Mrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express purpose. “Nothing’s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.” “Yes, but on a large scale?” “Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact.",0
"“Nothing more you can tell us about him?” he demanded, as I rose to depart. “Yes,” I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. “His head was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to alter that.” I observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow’s pen wavered. It was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic. In the first heat of indignation I found my next step unexpectedly easy to tackle. I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went into Scotland Yard.",0
"“You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely.",0
"Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down like that.",0
"and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant couple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin, and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm. Tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s constant resting-place. A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern. “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place. But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.” I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly. “A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye” He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words: “Key of Roll Top Desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys. “An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is also a young lady of method and order.” Baker came in answer to the bell. “Will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?” Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared the woman. “Cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.” Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will.",0
"His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion. Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift. Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes stuffed with rags but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side. “We’ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it matters. I can get you across. It’s the wrong side for a boattoo many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side for Livingstone.” “I can swim a little farther than that. What’s the danger, Harry?” For I had seen the grim look on his face. “Sharks?” “No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you’re sharp, Anne. Crocs, that’s the trouble.” “Crocodiles?” “Yes, don’t think of them or say your prayers, whichever you feel inclined.” We plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals.",0
"Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?” “But how on earth could you know all that?” “I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the little grey cells! They told me. Thus, and in no other way, could there have been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. Poirot listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious.",0
"For instance, if the object of the murderers was revenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him. Poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air. “Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably some distance away, since they wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.",0
"""And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter.",0
"But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.",0
"Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on.",0
"It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them something in the nature of joss-stick that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?” I shook my head. “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.” “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.” We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery.",0
"I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these ‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life.",0
"Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour slightly to my annoyance. I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon: “It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a garde-malad.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had occurred.",0
"Renauld come in? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very wonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations, or otherwise, could affect her?” “Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that you’re wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her.",0
"Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house.",0
"What do you think I found?” I shook my head. “This!” Pagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap. “What should a woman want with these?” I don’t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the high-class ladies’ papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew’s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly behind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even Pagett has his limits. “You’re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to this?” I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly.",0
"The curtains and portière were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward, passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, mon ami! And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief.",0
"“Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady, richly dressed fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming along slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl, gesticulating as he does so.",0
"But au fond, he is very business-like, ce monsieur! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone.",0
"You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man or with himself in a figurative sense might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.” “But not you, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at me. “He couldn’t baffle you, eh, Monsieur Poirot?” Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.",0
"""What is that?” “Jack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the golf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once, when they started to dig the bunker.” Giraud laughed out loud. “But it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found! Until it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been unable to enter into his inheritance.” I saw a quick flash of green in Poirot’s eyes as he rose to his feet. “Then why bury it?” he asked softly. “Reflect, Giraud.",0
"“At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.” Pagett retired. “By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair’s?” “Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur hats, I think.” “That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They are hats of a kind though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them. I dare say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What else was there?” “Some rolls of films and some baskets a lot of baskets” “There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.",0
") Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.",0
"But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.” I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly. “A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye” He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed.",0
"But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.",0
"What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It looks as though he had some hold over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested in spite of myself. “You don’t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he’s a most capable and hard-working young man.",0
"But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy.” Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth. “It is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? But must I be bothered now so soon?” “Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the Company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have empowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you. Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?” “I was changing for tea when my maid came up one of the gardeners had just run to the house. He had found” Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically. “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?” “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.” “Shooting rooks, eh?” “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.” “Where is this little rook rifle now?” “In the hall, I think.” She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily. “Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see” He paused delicately. “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head. The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us. “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?” She shook her head. “Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.” “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.” “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was only too right!” Tears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together. “Eh bien, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears to be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet” “Yet what?” “A slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not? Still, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own life there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood.",0
"Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted.",0
"That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.” “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?” “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr.",0
"Even I did not suspect triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, mon ami! On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle.",0
"“Épatant!” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first water.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?” His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it. “I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to see.",0
"de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow.",0
"“It seems strange to you, mon ami, that a man should plan his own death? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you he did not intend to die.” I shook my head, bewildered. “But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told you, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a different angle. “Georges Conneau flies from justice to Canada.",0
"“May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn’t interest me.” “I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said Poirot sweetly. I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and, if so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he had no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground. Meanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over the boundary, and tried the door of the little shed. “That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish.",0
"Had he been pumping me? Were those slight inaccuracies just tests to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) There is something to be said for life on board ship. It is peaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar.",0
"I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead man. The doctor didn’t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some figures.” “Let’s see it.” Lord Nasby stretched out a careless hand. “I think not,” I said, smiling. “It’s my find, you see.” “I’m right. You are a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it. No scruples about not handing it over to the police?” “I went there to do so this morning. They persisted in regarding the whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so I thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining the paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.” “Short-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here’s all I can do for you. Go on working on this line of yours. If you get anything anything that’s publishable send it along and you shall have your chance. There’s always room for real talent on the Daily Budget. But you’ve got to make good first. See?” I thanked him, and apologized for my methods. “Don’t mention it. I rather like cheek from a pretty girl. By the way, you said two minutes and you’ve been three, allowing for interruptions. For a woman, that’s quite remarkable! Must be your scientific training.” I was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been running. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance. I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen.” Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless. I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life. If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13” like that. There was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably the cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to title?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?) Yes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure. Figures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right, seven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps. That sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to get to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible. I made a strategic sally from my room and returned laden with books of reference. Who’s Who_, Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of Scotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other’s British Isles. Time passed. I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance. Finally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no such place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There must be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the “scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to let presumably was still to let. I would be a prospective tenant. I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers. “Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not not where” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying. I felt my bona fides was now quite established. “And perhaps I might get it cheap in the circumstances.” A master touch that, I thought. “Well, it’s possible. There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now servants and all that, you know. If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.",0
"You know Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a house there!” But with an incoherent muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled. That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett.",0
"Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the mirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag. “That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.",0
"We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. “Alias the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there was something more behind. “You haven’t caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.",0
"We’re partners I wouldn’t offer you a penny because I liked you, or because you’re a friendless girl what I want is a thrill, and I’m prepared to pay for it. We’re going into this together regardless of expense. To begin with you’ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we’ll plan out our campaign.” We argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn’t like it. I wanted to do the thing on my own. “That’s settled,” said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching herself with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted with my own eloquence.",0
"I never did quite swallow that scar. Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track. She wants the glory of discovering him for herself and the Daily Budget. Young women are very cold-blooded nowadays. I hinted to her that it was an unwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she run him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn’t like it, either, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may all be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs.",0
"” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. I could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. For he must have loved her once he must he must to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me.",0
"He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place. I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something. There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here. But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal.",0
"I am convinced that the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if you will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several years of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee.",0
"Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “Pardon M. Hautet,” I cried, “but will you permit me to ask him one question?” “But certainly, monsieur.” Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. “Where do you keep your boots?” “Sac à papier!” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?” “But when you go to bed at night?” “Under my bed.” “But who cleans them?” “Nobody.",0
"“What the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly. “I want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.” “There’s no doctor here.” The man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in adroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated Frenchman. “What you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You must come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.” “My dear sir” The door was opened again, the man, clad in a dressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with an uneasy glance round. “I will call the police.” Poirot prepared to descend the steps. “No, don’t do that for Heaven’s sake!” The man dashed after him.",0
"""Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock.",0
"But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr.",0
"“I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening.",0
"Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically: “At last you have seen the detective you admire the human foxhound! Is it not so, my friend?” “At any rate, he’s doing something,” I said, with asperity. “If there’s anything to find, he’ll find it. Now you ” “Eh bien! I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.” “Nonsense, Poirot. You know very well that’s got nothing to do with it. I meant little things traces that may lead us infallibly to the murderers.",0
"She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will.",0
"“Order” and “Method” were his gods. He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: “The true work, it is done from within.",0
"There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here.",0
"The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American. Throughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.",0
"What does it all mean?” Poirot handed him the copy of Society Gossip. “First, milord, I would ask you if these facts are substantially correct?” The peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read. “Damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “There’s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I believe. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.” “Still, the stone is known as ‘The Star of the East.’” “Well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully. Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply.",0
"” Poirot paused, and then added softly: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.” “Mrs. Robinson!” I gasped. “Well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended Poirot. “Also, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, mon ami, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below armed with that excellent revolver of yours, bien entendu!” “Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm.",0
"It was the Prime Minister! “For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?” “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.” “What?” “I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face” “But by whom?” “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does.",0
"le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions.",0
"“Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers for which I shall be hauled over the coals and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town. It’s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as he was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.” I paused for breath. “You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I spoke.” “What? Pagett?” I cried, in lively astonishment.",0
"But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there.",0
"The tears streaming down her face, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. She admitted that, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime but, before God, nothing more! She knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to the law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.",0
"""It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves or some one walking over my grave. I keep feeling something dreadful’s going to happen.” “Don’t be silly,” said Suzanne, with decision. “Let’s talk of something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.",0
"""Psychoanalysis, what?” said Black, with visible alarm. “Oh, no,” said Poirot reassuringly. “You see, it is like this, I give you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the first one you think of. Shall we begin?” “All right,” said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy. “Note down the words, please, Hastings,” said Poirot. Then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him. “We will commence. Day.” There was a moment’s pause, and then Black replied: “Night.” As Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.",0
"“Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.” The switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened. Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream. “My God!” cried Lord Yardly. “That was Maude’s voice! What has happened?” We rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the darkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight met our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck. As we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive, her eyelids opened. “The Chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “The Chinaman the side door.” Lord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart beating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry. There, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace, evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I swooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord Yardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap. The Star of the East was missing! “That settles it,” I breathed. “These were no ordinary thieves. This one stone was all they wanted.” “But how did the fellow get in?” “Through this door.” “But it’s always locked.” I shook my head. “It’s not locked now. See.” I pulled it open as I spoke. As I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It was a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had been torn from a Chinaman’s robe. “In his haste it caught in the door,” I explained. “Come, hurry. He cannot have gone far as yet.” But in vain we hunted and searched. In the pitch darkness of the night, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned reluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police. Lady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a woman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story. “I was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a man sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with such force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him disappearing through the side door. Then I realized by the pig-tail and the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.” She stopped with a shudder. The butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly. “A gentleman from Mr. Hoffberg’s, m’lord. He says you expect him.” “Good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “I must see him, I suppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.” I drew Poirot aside. “Look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to London?” “You think so, Hastings? Why?” “Well” I coughed delicately “things haven’t gone very well, have they? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose!” “True,” said Poirot, rather crestfallen. “It was not one of my most striking triumphs.” This way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I stuck to my guns. “So, having pardon the expression rather made a mess of things, don’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?” “And the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the chef of Lord Yardly has prepared?” “Oh, what’s dinner!” I said impatiently. Poirot held up his hands in horror. “Mon Dieu! It is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference.” “There’s another reason why we should get back to London as soon as possible,” I continued. “What is that, my friend?” “The other diamond,” I said, lowering my voice. “Miss Marvell’s.” “Eh bien, what of it?” “Don’t you see?” His unusual obtuseness annoyed me. What had happened to his usually keen wits? “They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.” “Tiens!” cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration. “But your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.” I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly. My idea was to go at once to the Magnificent, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly. In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them. I gave way unwillingly. Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief “Bien, j’y serai” he rang off, and turned to me. “What do you think, mon ami?” He looked half ashamed, half excited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.” “What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?” “This morning, I understand.” I shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me.",0
"The girl’s clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she’s ferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house. She was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a deduction quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather that she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have these intuitions I’ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess but to call it a deduction is absurd. How she ever got on the staff of the Daily Budget is more than I can imagine.",0
"""They say,” I said slowly, “that you are really connected with the Government that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road.",0
"And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences too! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders. This morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was urbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he alluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that I should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria. “You expect trouble, then?” I asked. His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far.",0
"You see I care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?” “No,” I whispered. “It was since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand and it frightened me.",0
"He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale.",0
"Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection. “Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.",0
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her. For my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject as we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest. “But yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not underrate the force of superstition.” “What are we going to do about it?” “Toujours pratique, the good Hastings! Eh bien, to begin with we are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr. Bleibner’s death.” He duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young Rupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead.",0
"Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.” “I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.” “You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?” “No, doctor, I’m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you’ll see, something will turn up! You’ll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.” My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa’s London solicitor. He came down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it.",0
"“Oh, do tell us!” Race smiled. “Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so it was reported, had returned from that part of South America bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some of them of considerable size.",0
"Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was going this afternoon.” To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so! “Enough of this,” he said harshly, rising. “What are you going to do with me?” I asked, still endeavouring to appear composed. “Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you.” For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me.",0
"""You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make.",0
"It will haunt me for ever!” “No, no,” I said soothingly. “Of course it’s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,” resumed Jack, “but I’d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and realized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so honestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself. I just drifted, in fact not realizing that I was driving the poor kid desperate. If she’d really knifed me, as she meant to, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she’s come forward now is downright plucky. I’d have stood the racket, you know up to the end.” He was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack: “What gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in underclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. I suppose he’d just given the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a mistake about its being 2 o’clock when they came. Or or, it wasn’t all a frame up, was it? I mean, my mother didn’t think couldn’t think that that it was me?” Poirot reassured him quickly. “No, no, M. Jack. Have no fears on that score. As for the rest, I will explain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you recount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?” “There’s very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in order to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The train was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf links. I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there. I had nearly reached the place when ” He paused and swallowed. “Yes?” “I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud a sort of choke and gasp but it frightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came round the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then and then I looked up and saw her. She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost it’s what she must have thought me at first all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot. “How would it be if you went on first to break the news to my mother that I am free ” “While you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?” finished Poirot, with a twinkle. “But yes, by all means, I was about to propose such an arrangement myself.” Jack Renauld did not wait for more. Stopping the car, he swung himself out, and ran up the path to the front door. We went on in the car to the Villa Geneviève. “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember how we arrived here that first day? And were met by the news of M. Renauld’s murder?” “Ah! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have happened since then especially for you, mon ami!” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The mise en scène designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the dénouement ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old woman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the salon. It was some time before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave. “Vous voilà, Hastings! Sacré tonnerre, but there are squalls ahead!” “What do you mean?” I cried. “I would hardly have credited it,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “but women are very unexpected.” “Here are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,” I exclaimed, looking out of the window. Poirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps outside. “Do not enter. It is better not. Your mother is very upset.” “I know, I know,” said Jack Renauld. “I must go up to her at once.” “But no, I tell you. It is better not.” “But Marthe and I ” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment.",0
"She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.” Denise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him. “Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?” Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely: “I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it.",0
"Do you think I want to put frocks on you? I’m a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I’m not going to let you go, do you hear? You’re my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose you. I’m never sure of you. You’re coming with me now to-night and damn everybody.” He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe. “I can’t do without you any longer, Anne. I can’t indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let’s go.” “My toothbrush?” I demurred. “You can buy one. I know I’m a lunatic, but for God’s sake, come!” He stalked off at a furious pace.",0
"With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot. The result had been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The “Mary” hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming’s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently disarming effect. Mr. Flemming was nervous too.",0
"” I endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of the case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that of Giraud which Poirot despised. I reflected anew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case. Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there I must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up my hypothesis.",0
"“My friends, if I were hiding from the police, do you know where I should hide? In a prison!” “What?” “You are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison, so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there!” “What do you mean?” “You tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman. Nevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and confronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him! In spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close.",0
"I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always something! And I mean to find it.” But Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short discoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched it delicately with his finger. “And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question. Giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor cared.",0
"I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?” I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs.",0
"""I see they did not come by post, these letters.” “No; they were left by hand by a Chinaman. That is what frightens me.” “Why?” “Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought the stone three years ago.” “I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be” “‘The Western Star,’” finished Miss Marvell. “That’s so. At the time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information. Gregory says he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing.",0
"Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one.",0
"I would be a prospective tenant. I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers.",0
"I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or less.” “There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate say a case of burglary can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.",0
"Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you need have no fear for yourself” I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face “you are not threatened. Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr. Milray wishes me to accompany you. The passage-money will be our affair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the passport, as though you had decided that you needed the services of a second secretary.” He seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he stared me down. “Very well,” I said feebly. “You will say nothing to any one as to my accompanying you.” “Very well,” I said again. After all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but I had a premonition that I was getting into deep waters. Just when I thought I had attained peace! I stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart. “It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I observed sarcastically. He considered for a minute. “Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed. It was a curious way of putting it. “Very well,” I said for the third time.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the more it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody else is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements and positively rejoicing in the storm. I regret to say that at the first roll the Kilmorden gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries.",0
"“I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds.",0
"There is one other person who could have taken the dagger.” “You refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in an automobile which had brought him straight from Calais. Ah, believe me, I have looked into everything. M. Jack Renauld arrived by train. An hour elapsed between his arrival, and the moment he presented himself at the house. Without doubt, he saw Captain Hastings and his companion leave the shed, slipped in himself and took the dagger, stabbed his accomplice in the shed ” “Who was already dead!” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Possibly he did not observe that. He may have judged him to be sleeping. Without doubt they had a rendezvous. In any case he knew this apparent second murder would greatly complicate the case. It did.” “But it could not deceive M. Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “You mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable proof. Madame Renauld’s story was false a fabrication from beginning to end. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband yet she lied to shield his murderer. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for herself, usually for the man she loves, always for her children. That is the last the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.” Giraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily. “That is my case,” said Giraud. “What have you to say to it?” “Only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.” “What is that?” “Jack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the golf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once, when they started to dig the bunker.” Giraud laughed out loud. “But it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found! Until it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been unable to enter into his inheritance.” I saw a quick flash of green in Poirot’s eyes as he rose to his feet. “Then why bury it?” he asked softly. “Reflect, Giraud. Since it was to Jack Renauld’s advantage that the body should be found without delay, why dig a grave at all?” Giraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance. Poirot moved towards the door. I followed him. “There is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,” he said over his shoulder. “What is that?” “The piece of lead piping,” said Poirot, and left the room. Jack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we came out of the salon, he looked up sharply. At the same moment there was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was descending it. At the sight of her son, standing between the two myrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified. “Jack,” she faltered. “Jack, what is this?” He looked up at her, his face set. “They have arrested me, mother.",0
"The typewriter is in perfect condition.” “What do you mean all the cases?” “The two small cases as well.” “I wish you wouldn’t be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases were no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.” Pagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake. “So you can just pack them up again neatly,” I continued. “After that you can go out and look around you. Jo’burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last chance.” I thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the morning, at any rate. “There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure, Sir Eustace.” “I haven’t got it now,” I said hastily.",0
"Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on. This morning I received this telegram.” He handed it over to me: “Come at once uncle Harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do come Zoe.” “Then, as yet you know no details?” “No, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the police are in charge.” It was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station of Elmer’s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors. “A lonely place,” I observed with a shiver. Havering nodded. “I shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.” We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us. “Japp!” I ejaculated. The Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion. “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.” “My wife” “I’ve seen your good lady, sir and the housekeeper. I won’t keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.” “I know nothing as yet as to what” “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly. “But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?” “He’s ill in bed with influenza.” “Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?” And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr. Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.” “What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.” I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality. I introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension. “Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur Poirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair?” “Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man arrived?” “It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?” “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.” “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.” “What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices.",0
"Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell. He merely called to Marchaud: “You have got the other there?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Bring her in then.” “The other” was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with vehemence. “I object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to do with all this?” “Madame,” said Giraud brutally, “I am investigating not one murder, but two murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.” “How dare you?” she cried. “How dare you insult me by such a wild accusation! It is infamous.” “Infamous, is it? What about this?” Stooping, he again detached the hair, and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He advanced towards her.",0
"No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",0
"But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day! Impossible to please him!” The sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity. “And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.” “One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “Quelle idée,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the salon. It is cool there on this hot morning.",0
"I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “Mon ami! Vive l’amour! It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!” After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived.",0
"What kept her there the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas en route to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the Anzora had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain.",0
"In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter. “I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried. Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I most disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was decidedly pretty.… “There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx.",0
"“You understand, don’t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.” He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. “I understand,” I said gratefully. “And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.” “No, of course not.” “You know his real name?” The question surprised me. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar.",0
"""Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then in the hotel at Kimberley we met her” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task.",0
"“It’s quite a common name.” “Ah! Sapristi, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and her husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New York, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the Camorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their track. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler? They offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of young couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be several Robinsons.",0
"In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside.",0
"“Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered.",0
"Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain. On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?” “Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one of your efforts of fancy.” “It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears.",0
"In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell. My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned. “Here you are and here you stay,” he remarked facetiously. I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. “I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.",0
"Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her.",0
"We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The mise en scène designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the dénouement ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs.",0
"” Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel’s face. “He’s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.” “Tell us about it.” “I mustn’t tell tales out of school.” “Tell us something even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.” “Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit’ having made the voyage with us?” “What?” I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again. Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. “It’s a fact, I believe.",0
"The windows were fastened securely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having intervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is likely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained undetected until Monday.” “Précisément,” said Poirot dryly. “Well, is he arrested, ce pauvre M. Lowen?” Japp grinned. “Not yet. But he’s under pretty close supervision.” Poirot nodded.",0
"It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly.",0
"“I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real.",0
"And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa.",0
"John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds. “But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute. Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart. He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago.",0
"""Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain Hastings.” Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. “Sent for you, did he?” “You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?” interposed M. Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about.",0
"Poirot threw me a withering glance. “What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!” he exclaimed sarcastically. “Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf a loaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to bake!” I endeavoured to distract his mind. “Anything interesting come by the post?” Poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air. “I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not exist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were banal to the last degree.",0
"It’s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There’s to be money in it ” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.",0
"He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. Eh bien! I must start again!” Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “Pauvre femme,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door.",0
"“You told me to get Cabin 17.” There is a touch of the “boy upon the burning deck” about Pagett. “My dear fellow,” I said testily, “I mentioned No. 17 because I happened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn’t mean you to make a stand to the death about it 13 or 28 would have done us equally well.” He looked hurt. “There’s something more, though,” he insisted. “Miss Beddingfeld got the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.” I looked at him severely. “If you’re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who is a missionary though a perfectly poisonous person and that attractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don’t believe a word of it,” I said coldly. “Anne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl with particularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.” Pagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld’s legs. He is the sort of man who never notices legs himself or, if he does, would die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way, you’d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for me.” “Surely you will not go in fancy dress?” said Pagett, in tones of horror. I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained. I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett was too tempting to be forborne. “What do you mean?” I said. “Of course I shall wear fancy dress. So will you.” Pagett shuddered. “So go down to the barber’s and see about it,” I finished. “I don’t think he’ll have any out sizes,” murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye. Without meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive. “And order a table for six in the saloon,” I said. “We’ll have the Captain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair” “You won’t get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,” Pagett interposed. “He’s asked her to dine with him, I know.” Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. “Who is Race?” I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. “They say he’s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don’t know for certain.” “Isn’t that like the Government?” I exclaimed. “Here’s a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone.” Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice.",0
"“Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once I offer it again. Will you have it?” The fierceness of his answer took me aback. “No. I’ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise.",0
"That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes.…” His voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start.” “You’ve oceans of time.” “Perhaps perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.” “At all events,” I said, rising, “I will come and see you off.” “You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.” He was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded emphatically. “I mean it, mon ami. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it is not the English custom.",0
"But I would give a considerable sum of money for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of whisky with him when he arrives to-morrow? I put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs. The curio-shops in Jo’burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying a window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the shop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race. I can’t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on his accompanying me back to the hotel.",0
"""Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying.",0
"“Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again will I vaunt my little grey cells!” “That’s a good job at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this all about?” As usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely no attention to me. “The tradesmen’s books I have left them entirely out of account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at once.” Easier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter, and there Poirot hired a car.",0
"So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it.",0
"“Come, come, mon ami. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! Bien! All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.” It was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught. “I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that” Poirot held up his hand. “My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.",0
"He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, c’est l’Anglais! Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was neatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an expensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on his left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up, black and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning! “I’m expecting the doctor any minute,” explained Giraud. “Although we hardly need him. There’s no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed to the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.” “When was it done? Last night?” Giraud shook his head. “Hardly. I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well ” I felt flustered. “I I assumed it.” “Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, mon petit does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here and here ” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have been careful to obliterate them but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?” “Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable. Also, by this ” And, leaning forward, he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see. It was a woman’s long black hair similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. Eh bien, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud.",0
"“Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.” Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: “We thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson she’s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too came hurrying down the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said. ‘But it’s no good. It’s already let.’ That seemed to finish it, but well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium.A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.” I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied. “So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly. “And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s have your deductions, Hastings.” “‘Obvious, my dear Watson,’” I quoted lightly. “She went to the wrong flat.” “Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” cried Mrs. Robinson admiringly. I rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities. The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities. “A curious story,” he said thoughtfully. “Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll.",0
"He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that.",0
"""I do not see that you can fix that definitely unless you question Mademoiselle Dabreuil again.” “There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see nothing, Hastings!” I looked at him for a moment. “Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being in the other’s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.” A faint smile crossed Poirot’s lips.",0
"Well, you see me! If you interest me, you will continue to see me for exactly two minutes longer.” “That will be ample,” I replied. “And I shall interest you. It’s the Mill House Mystery.” “If you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ write to the Editor,” he interrupted hastily. “If you will interrupt, I shall be more than two minutes,” I said sternly. “I haven’t found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ but I’m quite likely to do so.” In as few words as possible I put the facts of the Tube accident and the conclusions I had drawn from them before him.",0
"Why did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack Renauld’s face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself. “You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining magistrate this morning.” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my unchanging devotion.” “And you did see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face. There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, mon ami, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go up to the Villa Geneviève.” “By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road, “I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.” Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me. “And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired. Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.” “Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s only that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself all right.” Poirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked himself. Arrived at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered. He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! Un moment, s’il vous plaît.” I joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly startled, came running up to the hedge at his call. “A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?” “Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.” Despite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid. “Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast. “Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M. Jack Renauld.” “What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?” “Giraud.” “Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will he will ” She broke off. There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently. “You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face.",0
"""About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are but I’ve got another roll.",0
"Altogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast with poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of getting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired. Later. A very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray’s sealed letter. It didn’t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper! Now, I suppose, I’m in the devil of a mess. Why I ever let that bleating old fool Milray embroil me in the matter I can’t think. Pagett is a famous Job’s comforter. He displays a certain gloomy satisfaction that maddens me. Also, he has taken advantage of my perturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk. Unless he is careful, the next funeral he attends will be his own. However, in the end I had to listen to him. “Supposing, Sir Eustace, that Rayburn had overheard a word or two of your conversation with Mr. Milray in the street? Remember, you had no written authority from Mr. Milray. You accepted Rayburn on his own valuation.” “You think Rayburn is a crook, then?” I said slowly. Pagett did. How far his views were influenced by resentment over his black eye I don’t know. He made out a pretty fair case against Rayburn. And the appearance of the latter told against him. My idea was to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact. But Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was all for vigorous measures. He had his way of course. He bustled out to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a herd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies and sodas at my expense. We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned. You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. Later. Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot. You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced.",0
"“I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!” “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity. “I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!” I pondered the matter. “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. Bonne mère, très femme!” “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.” “Pas du tout,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that you, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.” “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung. “Si, si, mon ami, it is a pity that you study not the psychology. She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!” “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!” “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.” “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.” “Mon Dieu! but how you enrage yourself for nothing, mon ami!” “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself! I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise. “A la bonne heure, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.” “You are called away on a case, then?” “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.” “Yes?” I said, much interested.",0
"""What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.",0
"""Why?” “To find a possible witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love.",0
"In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case. I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker’s special hobby.",0
"""Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?” “Several times, I believe.” “He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him?” “Never.” “Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there?” “No.” “Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?” “Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there was a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.",0
"He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred.",0
"The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the crime passionnel is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.” “But what about the crime passionnel? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head.",0
"But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud. “What are your grounds for arresting him?” “Do you expect me to give them to you?” “As a matter of courtesy, yes.” Giraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary. “You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered. “It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice. Giraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red. “Eh bien, come in here.",0
"You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her.",0
"“What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out ” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “Cette dame? What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.",0
"I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend. “Bien!” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves.",0
"‘The secret! Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself.",0
"“Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little salon.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say ” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us.",0
"But, anyway, the valet has most to do with the gentlemen’s rooms.” “I see. Thank you.” Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head. “Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the valet.” I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents. In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same.",0
"It was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves against the wall. I heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. Then he flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear: “Allez.” We sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his arms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless.",0
"When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep.",0
"“So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.” “En vérité! And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, mon cher?” I thought. “About a dozen times perhaps.” “And I once! Yet I recognize her, and you do not.” “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly. “Ah! Sacré!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.” I shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed. “But console yourself, mon ami,” said Poirot, calming down. “All cannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.” “You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever knew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance. “What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share that opinion even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “Without doubt. She is coming here.” “How do you make that out?” “Very simply. This street, it is not aristocratic, mon ami! In it there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist still less is there a fashionable milliner! But there is a fashionable detective. Oui, my friend, it is true I am become the mode, the dernier cri! One says to another: ‘Comment? You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too marvellous! Every one goes! Courez!’ And they arrive! In flocks, mon ami! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below. “What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.” As usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American film star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet. Mary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their first visit to England. They had been given a great reception. Every one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful clothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great diamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the Western Star.” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds. All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client. Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking, with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child. Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once. “You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice. I dare say it’s only a silly hoax Gregory says so but it’s just worrying me to death.” She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement. “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.” “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot. The latter scrutinized them closely. “Cheap paper the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure. I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope. It ran as follows: “The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came.” The second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the third was more explicit: “You have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will be taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is written.” “The first letter I treated as a joke,” explained Miss Marvell. “When I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came yesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might be more serious than I had imagined.” “I see they did not come by post, these letters.” “No; they were left by hand by a Chinaman. That is what frightens me.” “Why?” “Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought the stone three years ago.” “I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be” “‘The Western Star,’” finished Miss Marvell. “That’s so. At the time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information. Gregory says he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing. He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was Greg’s wedding present to me.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet who knows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.” I complied. “Voyons!” said Poirot, turning the leaves. “When is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in three days’ time. Eh bien, madame, you seek my advice I give it to you. This belle histoire may be a hoax but it may not! Therefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.” A slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied constrainedly: “I’m afraid that’s impossible.” “You have it with you hein?” Poirot was watching her narrowly. The girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward, unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely set in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly. Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.",0
"I didn’t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide. “It is extraordinary to me,” said the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward. His name and address should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular not to do so.” I smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor. In pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard at an early date. But the next morning brought a surprise.",0
"But what a lot of things have happened since then especially for you, mon ami!” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning.",0
"“And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from you to your mother. Very sad very distressing ” Jack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M.",0
"“And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary.",0
"He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over. There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I shrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to materialize from nowhere and took command. I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination.",0
"Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P.",0
"“But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless disturbed had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death.",0
"” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas. And if some little fact will not fit in do not reject it but consider it closely.",0
"""Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate ” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it.",0
"” A slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied constrainedly: “I’m afraid that’s impossible.” “You have it with you hein?” Poirot was watching her narrowly. The girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward, unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely set in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly. Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss. “Épatant!” he murmured.",0
"But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth.",0
"I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms heavily paid for to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt.",0
"""What?” She uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait. She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.” Denise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him. “Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?” Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely: “I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it. Of course Giraud is all wrong wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not because of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all that I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts not by my leading you by the hand.” We established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested, looking out to sea. From farther along the sand, the cries of the bathers reached us faintly. The sea was of the palest blue, and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my own good spirits, and Poirot’s suggestion that I was “fey.” What a long time seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only three days! “Think, my friend,” said Poirot’s voice encouragingly. “Arrange your ideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.” I endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of the case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that of Giraud which Poirot despised. I reflected anew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case. Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there I must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up my hypothesis. “You have a little idea, I see, mon ami! Capital. We progress.” I sat up, and lit a pipe. “Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say we although I dare say I would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss.",0
"I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery.",0
"A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories.",0
"""Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment. “Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur.",0
"Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War.",0
"Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “Ma foi! but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.” “Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position. “He wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,” he remarked. “Yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.” At this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after him. He strode forward and opened it. Françoise was there. She endeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity. “Well, what is it?” demanded Bex impatiently. “Madame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite ready to receive the examining magistrate.” “Good,” said M. Bex briskly. “Tell M. Hautet and say that we will come at once.” Poirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But when he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. “He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly. We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman. She was middle-aged, and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call “une maitresse femme.” She greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head. “Pray be seated, monsieurs.” We took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a round table. “I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night?” “Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly assassins are to be caught and punished.” “Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.” “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.” “You mean they were false?” “Yes, madame. But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened desperately. “They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said. But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said. ‘The secret! Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money.",0
"Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and revised most of Papa’s Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors, Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote ages. I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject, probably not, and in any case he would not have been interested. The opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest degree. I think it was really a sign of his greatness. In the same way, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life.",0
"“My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up.",0
"And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament.",0
"""What does he himself say to that?” “Denied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid was positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose. Rather a weak story! And there’s fresh evidence against him come to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well, that ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called Billy Kellett! He’s already known to the police did three months last autumn for lifting an old gentleman’s watch.",0
"""Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.” “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?” “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.” “You would be doing the Government a great service a very great service. You would not find them er ungrateful.” “Meaning, you want me to be the postman?” “Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is bona fide. Everything would be eminently satisfactory.” “Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.",0
"” Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous in their methods. The thing worked. A powdered footman received the card and bore it away. Presently a pale secretary appeared. I fenced with him successfully. He retired defeated. He again reappeared and begged me to follow him. I did so. I entered a large room, a frightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant from the spirit-world. Then the door shut and I was face to face with Lord Nasby. A big man. Big head. Big face. Big moustache. Big stomach. I pulled myself together. I had not come here to comment on Lord Nasby’s stomach. He was already roaring at me.",0
"“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.",0
"The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again: “And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .” “Poirot,” I cried, “I see” “You see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments.",0
"""The matter on which you want to consult him is serious?” “My God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was foully murdered last night.” “Here in London?” “No, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to come round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.” “If you will excuse me a minute,” I said, struck by a sudden idea. I rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with the situation. He took any further words out of my mouth. “I see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not? You should know my methods by now.",0
"Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.",0
"“It looks like hair,” I remarked distastefully. “It is hair. I think it’s what they call a toupee.” “Indeed,” I commented. “Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in disguise?” “Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by her feet.” “Then that’s that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you about my private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have found me out.” At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be revealed! “Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,” I said kindly.",0
"This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000. “On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found to contain knobs of sugar! “Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not know. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields was all a fantasy.",0
"Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne.” A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him covered with the revolver. “So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up.",0
"We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned. You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. Later. Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot.",0
"I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress. “I told you that I was staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but of course really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again. “Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God’s earth. I told her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing… laughing… laughing… it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once. “And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night… I was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her. So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.” “But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you.",0
"“The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.",0
"""If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly.",0
"Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! mon Dieu! What else could it be?” “Blackmail,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor.",0
"“First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.” The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell. We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner. Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind.",0
"Secondly, the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly, as he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of Lowen.” Japp nodded. “I don’t say you’re not right. But all the same, you won’t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird’s evidence. What seems odd to me is that Lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",0
"He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at this juncture, he suddenly asked: “M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?” “No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there is here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.” “A bunkair?” Poirot turned to me. “That is the irregular hole filled with sand and a bank at one side, is it not?” I concurred. “You do not play the golf, M. Poirot?” inquired Bex.",0
"Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack. “He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, jeune homme?” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said. I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud. “What are your grounds for arresting him?” “Do you expect me to give them to you?” “As a matter of courtesy, yes.” Giraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary. “You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered. “It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice. Giraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red. “Eh bien, come in here. You shall judge for yourself.” He flung open the door of the salon, and we passed in, leaving Jack Renauld in the care of the two other men. “Now, M. Poirot,” said Giraud laying his hat on the table, and speaking with the utmost sarcasm, “I will treat you to a little lecture on detective work. I will show you how we moderns work.” “Bien!” said Poirot, composing himself to listen. “I will show you how admirably the Old Guard can listen,” and he leaned back and closed his eyes, opening them for a moment to remark. “Do not fear that I shall sleep. I will attend most carefully.” “Of course,” began Giraud, “I soon saw through all that Chilian tomfoolery. Two men were in it but they were not mysterious foreigners! All that was a blind.” “Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “Especially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.” Giraud glared, but continued: “A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the grave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there was a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld’s quarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The motive was established. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night. He concealed the fact which turned suspicion into certainty. Then we found a second victim stabbed with the same dagger. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here can fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only person who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other members of the household.” Poirot interrupted: “You are wrong.",0
"That’s what makes it so wonderful.” “Wonderful is the word! It’s a blinking miracle. But there must be a catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?” “No premium!” “No prem oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned Parker. “But we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued Mrs. Robinson. “Ah!” Parker brisked up. “I knew there was a catch!” “For fifty pounds. And it’s beautifully furnished!” “I give it up,” said Parker. “The present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy.” Mrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker appeared between her dainty brows.",0
"“But console yourself, mon ami,” said Poirot, calming down. “All cannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.” “You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever knew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance. “What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share that opinion even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “Without doubt. She is coming here.” “How do you make that out?” “Very simply. This street, it is not aristocratic, mon ami! In it there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist still less is there a fashionable milliner! But there is a fashionable detective. Oui, my friend, it is true I am become the mode, the dernier cri! One says to another: ‘Comment? You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too marvellous! Every one goes! Courez!’ And they arrive! In flocks, mon ami! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below. “What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.” As usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American film star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet. Mary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their first visit to England. They had been given a great reception. Every one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful clothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great diamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the Western Star.” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds. All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client. Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking, with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child. Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once. “You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice. I dare say it’s only a silly hoax Gregory says so but it’s just worrying me to death.” She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement. “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.” “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot. The latter scrutinized them closely. “Cheap paper the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure. I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.",0
"He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for them. I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and airily trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously. That is what makes him so difficult to live with. Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence. He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there.",0
"“What has South Africa to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms, her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and her diamonds” I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of the miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist.",0
"There will be no great danger in Jo’burg.” The women immediately looked at him in the “What a brave hero you are” manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as Race but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it all their own way. “I suppose you’ll be there,” I said coldly. “Very possibly. We might travel together.” “I’m not sure that I shan’t stay on at the Falls a bit,” I answered non-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo’burg? He’s got his eye on Anne, I believe. “What are your plans, Miss Anne?” “That depends,” she replied demurely, copying me.",0
"On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser.",0
"But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place. I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something.",0
"There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No and there ought to have been. Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon.",0
"“Yes, I do feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled. I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was. “That man? Oh, that’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary. Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before. Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him, and the sea’s been too much for both of them. The other fellow hasn’t turned up yet. This man’s name is Pagett.” So Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board. Probably only a coincidence, and yet “That’s Sir Eustace,” my informant continued, “sitting next to the Captain. Pompous old ass.” The more I studied the secretary’s face, the less I liked it. Its even pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously flattened head it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension. Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind him as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied. “My cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.",0
"The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew. We returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee line for the Anchor Inn. “Here we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,” he explained. “You notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I meant it. But no you observed Mrs. Maltravers’ face when she caught sight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he eh bien, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here on Tuesday night the day before Mr. Maltravers died.",0
"“But what is there in him that attracts you so? I don’t see that there’s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good looks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.” I poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes. “Just because you’re comfortably married and getting fat, you’ve forgotten that there’s any such thing as romance,” I ended. “Oh, I’m not getting fat, Anne. All the worry I’ve had about you lately must have worn me to a shred.” “You look particularly well nourished,” I said coldly. “I should say you must have put on about half a stone.",0
"Systematized crime, organized by the man known to his followers as the “Colonel”! I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the strike on the Rand and the causes underlying it and the belief that some secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation. That was the “Colonel’s” work, his emissaries were acting according to plan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard, as he limited himself to directing and organizing. The brain-work not the dangerous labour for him. But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently impeccable position. That, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race’s presence on the Kilmorden Castle. He was out after the arch-criminal. Everything fitted in with that assumption. He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that. In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger! Some knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them anxious to remove me at all costs and that knowledge was bound up somehow with the diamonds. There was one person, I felt sure, who could enlighten me if he would! The Man in the Brown Suit Harry Rayburn. He knew the other half of the story. But he had vanished into the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit. In all probability he and I would never meet again. I brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment. It was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn. He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first. Or, at leastThere I was again dreaming! The real problem was what to do _now! I, priding myself upon my rôle of watcher, had become the watched. And I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve. I was the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of the great machine and I fancied that the machine would have a short way with little bits of grit. Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once I had saved myself but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily against me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and they were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter. I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so. In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform. A porter tried to stop me, but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the footboard. I mounted the two steps and opened the gate. I was safe! The train was gathering way. We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I waved to him. “Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,” I shouted. Never have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he had seen a ghost. In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily. “Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person you are.” Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. “I must report myself to my chief,” I said demurely. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office middle compartment dictating at an incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.” “This enthusiasm for work is something new,” I commented. “H’m!” said Colonel Race. “His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily. Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech atWhat’s the matter? Why aren’t you taking it down?” “I think,” said Colonel Race gently, “that Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.” He took it from her and sharpened it. Sir Eustace stared, and so did I. There was something in Colonel Race’s tone that I did not quite understand. (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) I am inclined to abandon my Reminiscences. Instead I shall write a short article entitled “Secretaries I have had.” As regards secretaries, I seem to have fallen under a blight. At one minute I have no secretaries, at another I have too many. At the present minute I am journeying to Rhodesia with a pack of women. Race goes off with the two best-looking, of course, and leaves me with the dud. That is what always happens to me and, after all, this is my private car, not Race’s. Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the beauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her principal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn’t even doing that. Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don’t blame her if so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew she is a repellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman. There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld. She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine for all the world as though she’d been running a race and yet Pagett told me that he’d seen her off to Durban last night! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body. And she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, “Secretaries I have had.” No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once. No. 4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is really a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of Pagett’s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn’t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived by Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch. He never worried me or got in my way. Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us can move without falling over it. I went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my appearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were listening spellbound to one of Race’s travellers’ tales. I shall label this car not “Sir Eustace Pedler and Party,” but “Colonel Race and Harem.” Then Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every time we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed higher and higher, she snapped at the engine. “You see the point,” she cried delightedly. “It must be some curve if you can photograph the front part of the train from the back, and with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.” I pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly. “I shall write underneath it: ‘Taken from the train. Engine going round a curve.’” “You could write that under any snapshot of a train,” I said. Women never think of these simple things. “I’m glad we’ve come up here in daylight,” cried Anne Beddingfeld. “I shouldn’t have seen this if I’d gone last night to Durban, should I?” “No,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “You’d have waked up to-morrow morning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of stones and rocks.” “I’m glad I changed my mind,” said Anne, sighing contentedly, and looking round. It was rather a wonderful sight. The great mountains all around, through which we turned and twisted and laboured ever steadily upwards. “Is this the best train in the day to Rhodesia?” asked Anne Beddingfeld. “In the day?” laughed Race. “Why, my dear Miss Anne, there are only three trains a week. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Do you realize that you don’t arrive at the Falls until Saturday next?” “How well we shall know each other by that time,” said Mrs. Blair maliciously. “How long are you going to stay at the Falls, Sir Eustace?” “That depends,” I said cautiously. “On what?” “On how things go at Johannesburg. My original idea was to stay a couple of days or so at the Falls which I’ve never seen, though this is my third visit to Africa and then go on to Jo’burg and study the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I pose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all I hear, Jo’burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit in about a week’s time. I don’t want to study conditions in the midst of a raging revolution.” Race smiled in a rather superior manner. “I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace. There will be no great danger in Jo’burg.” The women immediately looked at him in the “What a brave hero you are” manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as Race but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it all their own way.",0
"Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open. “You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes though not always then and it is against that that we are going to make provision.” He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes.",0
"I had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor. The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven. The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a cupboard.",0
"At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find! I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking.",0
"He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror. No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He’s not to leave the house without orders.” He put the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping the table with his hand. “May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,” I said, after a minute or two of silence. “Certainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.” “Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden. Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the Kilmorden_ either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right. It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never read the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all did, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22. The thing I don’t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer instinct.” “And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?” “My dear Anne, you don’t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar. When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after me! I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since.",0
"It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored.",0
"You accompany me, n’est-ce pas?” “Well ” “You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.” “Oh, that’s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.” “Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the name?” “There’s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name’s Renauld. I don’t know whether it could be the same.” “But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is in Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress finely.” “Dear me, Poirot,” I said, my excitement rising, “I smell some goodly shekels in this.",0
"The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.",0
"“There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble. There is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives have been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents which throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import them. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean ‘detonators,’ cauliflower, ‘rifles,’ other vegetables stand for various explosives.” “That’s very interesting,” I commended.",0
"I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, c’est comme ça!” Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?” “Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do either of you ever see Society Gossip?” We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly. “I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it’s really very curious” She broke off.",0
"""I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.” “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway” “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen.",0
"Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them. Rolf nodded to us as we entered. “We’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it’s almost unbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can’t think.” A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit.",0
"’” “At expensive French watering-places?” “Dirt cheap if you know where to go.” I eyed her keenly. “Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?” “We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously. “There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime at the Villa Geneviève ?” She stared at me.",0
"“Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.",0
"The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But ” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the ” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “Mille tonnerres!” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!” A cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear tones came the words: “No, you don’t! I’ve got you and my wrists are just like steel.” At the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by Françoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door. “It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.” There was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale, beckoned us in. “She is safe?” demanded Poirot. “Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.” Mrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping for breath. “Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong. “A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at the door. Where is the other?” The girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil! ve confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you must have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room her boudoir,” he explained. “But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you why was I not told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child ” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour slightly to my annoyance. I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon: “It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a garde-malad.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had occurred. The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible. Nobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them. Angrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted. I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot, neat and smiling, sitting beside the bed. “Enfin you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings! Do you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?” I groaned and put a hand to my head. “I must have been dreaming,” I said. “Do you know, I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?” “You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.” “But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?” “Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did yes but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.” “What?” “Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife. So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can simulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating type as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him, but separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to separate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack the heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and at a stroke she will attain wealth not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil the dagger! Jack Renauld had three souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans. “(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that she might have killed M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because, as I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one finds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very likely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir paper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all the time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld. When she actually came forward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And yet I was not satisfied, mon ami. I was not satisfied.… “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before. If it was not Bella Duveen, the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one single proof against her! “And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea since, as she thought, it belonged to her sister. But if, by any chance, it was not her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings (it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told her as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out (according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession! “In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open. By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a desperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted that I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions and failed!” “What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle. We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike. Even I did not suspect triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son.",0
"Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the the body?” “Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure? It would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it. Still M. Bex, might I trouble you?” “Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.” “Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested Giraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s body.",0
"The brain-work not the dangerous labour for him. But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently impeccable position. That, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race’s presence on the Kilmorden Castle. He was out after the arch-criminal. Everything fitted in with that assumption. He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that. In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger! Some knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them anxious to remove me at all costs and that knowledge was bound up somehow with the diamonds. There was one person, I felt sure, who could enlighten me if he would! The Man in the Brown Suit Harry Rayburn. He knew the other half of the story. But he had vanished into the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit. In all probability he and I would never meet again. I brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment. It was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn. He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first. Or, at leastThere I was again dreaming! The real problem was what to do _now! I, priding myself upon my rôle of watcher, had become the watched. And I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve. I was the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of the great machine and I fancied that the machine would have a short way with little bits of grit. Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once I had saved myself but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily against me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and they were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner.",0
"In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order.",0
"There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love.” “Eh eh! The sentimentality,” warned Poirot. “Where one hates one also loves,” I quoted or misquoted. “At any rate he finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old wrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave.",0
"“In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we get what?” “Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.” “Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.” “I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed. “You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll test his alibi?” “Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.” “You think he has an alibi?” “That is just what worries me.",0
"Maman made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.",0
"It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale if it were all would indeed be plain sailing it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one.",0
"Schneider to-day.’ And a bit more of the same. Young Bleibner lit out for Cairo right away.” “Was he in perfectly good health at the time?” “The old man?” “No, the young one.” “I believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But it couldn’t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.” “One thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?” “So far as we know, he has not.” “Are you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?” “No, sir, I am not. I’m for New York as soon as I can square up things here.",0
"At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up. “Keep still, please,” I said. He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a little. “Thank you, I don’t need anything done for me.” His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks of even common gratitude! “That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” He flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour of him. My temper, never placid, rose.",0
"I know what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still ” I began, and stopped. “Still as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my conscience horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be acquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he was not.… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son, who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily. So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear. We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Eh bien, speaking frankly in confidence, c’est entendu can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with empressement. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot. “It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “A demain then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike rude, sneering fellows. They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my er experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “Pardon! But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “Toqué!” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “Toqué!” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting. Eh bien, once or twice, your manner has annoyed me.” “I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.” “He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “Dear M. Poirot: “If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn to, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees to help us. “MARTHE DAUBREUIL.” I handed it back, moved. “You will go?” “At once. We will command an auto.” Half an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the door to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of his. “Ah, you have come it is good of you. I have been in despair, not knowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even. I suffer horribly, I am nearly mad. Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down like that.” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he but what do men care if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.” “Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, petite, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound. When he had finished, she drew a long breath. “But you are wonderful magnificent! You are the greatest detective in the world.” With a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French. “Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so.",0
"“Assuring you once more that the matter is urgent, “Yours faithfully “P. T. RENAULD.” Below the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “For God’s sake, come!” I handed the letter back with quickened pulses. “At last!” I said. “Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.” “Yes, indeed,” said Poirot meditatively. “You will go of course,” I continued. Poirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his mind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave. “See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty of time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion.",0
"It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right especially with the help of this.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella.",0
"""Well, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me disappearing in the distance? Wouldn’t he take it for granted that I was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I he was following?” “It’s possible, yes,” I said slowly. “But it alters all our ideas. And there are other things.” “Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man might have merely asked him the time.” “It was just a coincidence, you mean?” “Not exactly. There’s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with the affair.",0
"There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph. “According to plan,” he said softly. “You amateurs will pit yourselves against professionals.” “What’s the meaning of this?” cried Harry hoarsely. “It means that you have walked into my parlour said the spider to the fly,” remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. “My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.” “You said I could come safely, Anne?” “Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself.",0
"Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.” “Who is his uncle?” “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.” “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?” “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds.",0
"Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wrist watch which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.",0
"But it has led to nothing.” “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?” A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced anyone above suspicion.” “Très bien. Now I understand, milord, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?” Lord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes.",0
"“It is a quiet little place but chic! It lies about midway between Bolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English people who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in England, I suppose?” “Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the country, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little about him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. I believe he has large South American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life out in Chile and the Argentino.” “Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us pack.",0
"Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight hours and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes a faint scratching sound came to my ears. Poirot’s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there. Poirot placed his lips to my ear. “Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast. Be careful, he will have a knife.” Presently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light appeared through the door.",0
"All Papa’s friends were aged Professors usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a “neat little waist” and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a “neat little waist” since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always “felled their opponent with a single blow.” There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could “fell” an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela.” Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair. She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious whirl and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me. It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa. They passed to Europe” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood. I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.” “I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.” “You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?” “No, doctor, I’m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you’ll see, something will turn up! You’ll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.” My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa’s London solicitor. He came down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it. He was benignant, kind and fatherly and without the least doubt he regarded me as a perfect fool of a girl left adrift to face an unkind world. From the first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary. As things turned out, perhaps it was just as well I didn’t. “My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?” “Oh, yes.” “Your father, as you know, was a very great man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.” I knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so. He continued: “I do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try to explain as clearly as I can.” He explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that I was left to face life with the sum of £87, 17s. 4d. It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next. I feared that Mr. Flemming would be sure to have an aunt in Scotland who was in want of a bright young companion. Apparently, however, he hadn’t. “The question is,” he went on, “the future. I understand you have no living relatives?” “I’m alone in the world,” I said, and was struck anew by my likeness to a film heroine. “You have friends?” “Every one has been very kind to me,” I said gratefully. “Who would not be kind to one so young and charming?” said Mr. Flemming gallantly. “Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be done.” He hesitated a minute, and then said: “Supposing how would it be if you came to us for a time?” I jumped at the chance. London! The place for things to happen. “It’s awfully kind of you,” I said. “Might I really? Just while I’m looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?” “Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something suitable.” I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of “something suitable” and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. “That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?” “Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming” “My wife will be delighted to welcome you.” I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home orphans without consulting me first. “We will send her a wire from the station,” continued the lawyer. My few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat sadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a “Mary” hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out but doesn’t! A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim. With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot. The result had been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The “Mary” hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming’s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently disarming effect. Mr. Flemming was nervous too. I realized that as we went up the stairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming greeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the “good wife and mother” type. She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices. I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. “Well, Henry, why on earth” I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident. And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice: “I agree with you! She is certainly very good-looking.” It is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are. With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice hair. It is black a real black, not dark brown, and it grows well back from my forehead and down over the ears. With a ruthless hand I dragged it upwards. As ears, my ears are quite all right, but there is no doubt about it, ears are démodé nowadays. They are like the “Queen of Spain’s legs” in Professor Peterson’s young day. When I had finished I looked almost unbelievably like the kind of orphan that walks out in a queue with a little bonnet and a red cloak. I noticed when I went down that Mrs. Flemming’s eyes rested on my exposed ears with quite a kindly glance. Mr. Flemming seemed puzzled. I had no doubt that he was saying to himself, “What has the child done to herself?” On the whole the rest of the day passed off well. It was settled that I was to start at once to look for something to do. When I went to bed, I stared earnestly at my face in the glass. Was I really good-looking? Honestly, I couldn’t say I thought so! I hadn’t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the things you ought to have. It is true that a curate once told me that my eyes were like “imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood” but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them off at random.",0
"How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death.",0
"It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The mal de mer it is horrible suffering!” “Oh!” I said, rather taken aback. The first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and closed his eyes. “Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to study it?” Poirot shook his head impatiently. “But no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the stomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer. You breathe in and out slowly, so turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath.” I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.",0
"But somehow I’ve got the feeling he’s alive all right.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, yes; he’s alive. But can he be found in time? I, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.” The whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then, with a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station. It was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together. Maps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages. Each man had his own pet theory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring in front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an amusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot’s behaviour moved me to intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat, clutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily. “Mon Dieu!” he murmured. “This is terrible!” “Have courage, Poirot,” I cried. “You will succeed. You will find him. I am sure of it.” “Ah, mon ami, you mistake my emotion. It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The mal de mer it is horrible suffering!” “Oh!” I said, rather taken aback. The first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and closed his eyes. “Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to study it?” Poirot shook his head impatiently. “But no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the stomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer. You breathe in and out slowly, so turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath.” I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck. As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.” “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.” “What?” “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.” He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending. He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?” His eyes challenged us. “But I Hercule Poirot tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within here!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot so and I say: the Prime Minister is there! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.” And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously contemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness. Finally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the window. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned for my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the daily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay alongside the quay. Suddenly I was aroused by Poirot’s voice close to my elbow. “Mes amis, let us start!” I turned. An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend. His eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to the uttermost. “I have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.” Major Norman moved hastily to the door. “I’ll order the car.” “There is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has fallen.” “Do you mean you are going to walk, sir?” “No, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea by boat.” “To cross the sea?” “Yes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And the beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return to England.” At three o’clock, we stood once more upon Charing Cross platform. To all our expostulations, Poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time, but the only way. On the way over, he had conferred with Norman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from Dover. Owing to the special passes held by Norman, we got through everywhere in record time. In London, a large police car was waiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend. He answered my inquiring glance. “A list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of London. I wired for it from Dover.” We were whirled rapidly through the London streets. We were on the Bath Road.",0
"I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour. “My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,” she began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.” “If you please, mademoiselle.” “I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county. He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter. “Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these ‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted on that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’ “That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered.",0
"Havering in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, speeding rapidly away from London. “To begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunter’s Lodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is only a small shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors. Our real home is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town for the season. Hunter’s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional week-end. Of course, during the shooting season, we take down some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss Pace of New York), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. He never got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me. Of course I am a poor man, and my uncle was a rich one in other words, he paid the piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on. This morning I received this telegram.” He handed it over to me: “Come at once uncle Harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do come Zoe.” “Then, as yet you know no details?” “No, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the police are in charge.” It was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station of Elmer’s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors. “A lonely place,” I observed with a shiver. Havering nodded. “I shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.” We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us. “Japp!” I ejaculated. The Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion. “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.” “My wife” “I’ve seen your good lady, sir and the housekeeper. I won’t keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.” “I know nothing as yet as to what” “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly. “But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?” “He’s ill in bed with influenza.” “Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that.",0
"On Friday we’re going down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly.” Her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some gossip what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California why! it came to me in a flash of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf. “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing.",0
"But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.” “Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “Mon ami, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to the facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason not like Giraud but like Hercule Poirot.” “But are you sure?” “My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile.",0
"“This is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland Yard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I have asked Miss Esmée Farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us.” “What about Ridgeway?” “What about him?” asked Poirot with a twinkle. “Why, you surely don’t think you can’t” “The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a matter of fact I did think. If Ridgeway had been the thief which was perfectly possible the case would have been charming; a piece of neat methodical work.” “But not so charming for Miss Farquhar.” “Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now, Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes, as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore” “Yes, but we know” “You may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since it seemed incredible, it was incredible. Two possibilities remain: it was hidden on board also rather difficult or it was thrown overboard.” “With a cork on it, do you mean?” “Without a cork.” I stared. “But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been sold in New York.” “I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that leads us?” “Where we were when we started.” “Jamais de la vie! If the package was thrown overboard, and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in London.” “Yes, but then” Poirot waved an impatient hand. “Permit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the morning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after the Olympia gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody listens to, actually before she gets in. Supposing then, that they have never been on the Olympia at all? Is there any other way they could get to New York? Yes. The Gigantic leaves Southampton on the same day as the Olympia, and she holds the record for the Atlantic. Mailed by the Gigantic, the bonds would be in New York the day before the Olympia arrived. All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one. Très bien, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as the Olympia is in, but some one must travel on the Olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery.",0
"“First, milord, I would ask you if these facts are substantially correct?” The peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read. “Damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “There’s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I believe. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.” “Still, the stone is known as ‘The Star of the East.’” “Well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully. Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. “What I would ask you to do, milord, is to place yourself in my hands. If you do so unreservedly, I have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.” “Then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat tales?” “Will you do as I ask you?” “Of course I will, but” “Bien! Then permit that I ask you a few questions. This affair of Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and Mr. Rolf?” “Oh, he told you about it, did he? No, there’s nothing settled.” He hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. “Might as well get the thing straight. I’ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways, Monsieur Poirot and I’m head over ears in debt but I want to pull up. I’m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten things up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf is offering me big money enough to set me on my feet again. I don’t want to do it I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the Chase but I may have to, unless” He broke off. Poirot eyed him keenly. “You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to find one soon, or it’s a washout.” “One more question, permettez Lady Yardly, which plan does she approve?” “Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. You know what women are. She’s all for this film stunt.” “I comprehend,” said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought, then rose briskly to his feet. “You return to Yardly Chase at once? Bien! Say no word to anyone to anyone mind but expect us there this evening. We will arrive shortly after five.” “All right, but I don’t see” “Ça n’a pas d’importance,” said Poirot kindly. “You will that I preserve for you your diamond, n’est-ce pas?” “Yes, but” “Then do as I say.” A sadly bewildered nobleman left the room. It was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs. A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler. Lady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward uncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little man was equal to the occasion. “All my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss Marvell’s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure. Also I wanted to ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received?” Lady Yardly shook her head regretfully. “I’m afraid I don’t. It is stupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them seriously.” “You’ll stay the night?” said Lord Yardly. “Oh, milord, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at the inn.” “That’s all right.” Lord Yardly had his cue. “We’ll send down for them. No, no no trouble, I assure you.” Poirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady Yardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game. “Vous êtes bonne mère,” said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse. Lady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair. “I adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice. “And they you with reason!” Poirot bowed again. A dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly. With an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at my friend. “Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about this. It’s from Hoffberg. He thinks he’s found a customer for the diamond an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They’re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if this goes through” Words failed him. Lady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her hand. “I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said, in a low voice. “It’s been in the family so long.” She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her shoulders. “I must go and dress. I suppose I had better display ‘the goods.’” She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. “It’s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George has always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never been done.” She left the room. Half an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady. It was already a few minutes past the dinner hour. Suddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed in the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress. Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there with one hand just touching the necklace. “Behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to have vanished.",0
"“To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.” I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp. “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.” Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply: “Be exact, my friend.",0
"He was inclined to resent our appearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland Yard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation. This was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The story he had to tell was a sensational one. On the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his master.",0
"I don’t like the prospect of being hungry, but I’m not alarmed for my personal safety. Smuts is perfectly capable of dealing with the revolution. But I would give a considerable sum of money for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of whisky with him when he arrives to-morrow? I put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs. The curio-shops in Jo’burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying a window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the shop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race. I can’t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on his accompanying me back to the hotel. I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily. “Where the devil did she go to that night, that’s what I’d like to know.” “She was on the island all the time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man on it?” “Yes.” “How very improper,” I said. “Pagett will be quite shocked. He always did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld. I suppose that was the young man she originally intended to meet in Durban?” “I don’t think so.” “Don’t tell me anything you don’t want to,” I said, by way of encouraging him. “I fancy that this is a young man we should all be very glad to lay our hands on.” “Not?” I cried, in rising excitement. He nodded. “Harry Rayburn, alias Harry Lucas that’s his real name, you know. He’s given us all the slip once more, but we’re bound to rope him in soon.” “Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying. Without stopping to reflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading statements, I gave myself up to the pleasure of scoring off Race. He is always so cocksure. I took the telegram from my pocket and handed it to him. “Then how do you explain this?” I asked nonchalantly. He seemed dumbfounded. “She said she was just starting for Beira,” he said, in a dazed voice. I know that Race is supposed to be clever. He is, in my opinion, rather a stupid man. It never seemed to occur to him that girls do not always tell the truth. “Kimberley too. What are they doing there?” he muttered. “Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the Daily Budget.” “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. “I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully. “Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers for which I shall be hauled over the coals and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town. It’s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as he was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.” I paused for breath. “You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I spoke.” “What? Pagett?” I cried, in lively astonishment. “He’s been with me eight years a most trustworthy fellow.” My interlocutor smiled. “We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.” “Miss Pettigrew?” I exclaimed. “Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop.” “God bless my soul!” I interrupted. “I was going into that place myself this afternoon. You might have caught me coming out!” There doesn’t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in Jo’burg without being suspected for it. “Ah! but she has been there more than once and in rather doubtful circumstances. I may as well tell you in confidence, Sir Eustace that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by the secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady. Where and how did you come to engage her?” “She was lent to me,” I replied coldly, “by your own Government.” He collapsed utterly.

"A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.” I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied. “So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly.",0
"“I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully. “Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers for which I shall be hauled over the coals and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town.

(Anne’s Narrative Resumed) As soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne. She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off en route. I was awfully surprised to find that she really was fond of me I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. When we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully, when I had finished. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you. Oh, Anne, dear, don’t be cross, but how do you know that this young man of yours is telling the truth? You believe every word he says.” “Of course I do,” I cried indignantly. “But what is there in him that attracts you so? I don’t see that there’s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good looks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.” I poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes. “Just because you’re comfortably married and getting fat, you’ve forgotten that there’s any such thing as romance,” I ended. “Oh, I’m not getting fat, Anne.",0
"“He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, jeune homme?” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said. I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him.",0
"Maltravers,” said Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing further” We took the hint. “Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?” “Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.” And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces. “And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor. “Rather an old ass.” “Exactly.",0
"She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him. She is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow.",0
"“Chéri,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.” “Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack I am afraid.” I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man’s arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers.",0
"Une poignee de main, alors.” I felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down the beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to join them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end.",0
"The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story. “You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly.",0
"If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps going out of my life. I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours.",0
"""And your theory is?” “For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations.” “Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.” “Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.",0
"Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.” She stopped.",0
"Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.",0
"“They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look. “On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?” “Very curious,” I agreed. “And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.” He looked down at the body again. “As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wore gloves.” “You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. “Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared at the doorway. “Monsieur?” “Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago?” “She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.” “Good. I only want one at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared again. A moment later he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld. “Here is Madame.” Giraud came forward with a curt bow. “This way, madame.” He led her across, and then, standing suddenly aside. “Here is the man. Do you know him?” And as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to read her mind, noting every indication of her manner. But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm too calm, I felt. She looked down at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life. He is quite a stranger to me.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure.” “You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?” “No,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. “No, I do not think so. Of course they wore beards false ones the examining magistrate thought, but still no.” Now she seemed to make her mind up definitely. “I am sure neither of the two was this man.” “Very well, madame. That is all, then.” She stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads in her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify the man, in a completely natural manner. Giraud merely grunted. Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell. He merely called to Marchaud: “You have got the other there?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Bring her in then.” “The other” was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with vehemence. “I object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to do with all this?” “Madame,” said Giraud brutally, “I am investigating not one murder, but two murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.” “How dare you?” she cried. “How dare you insult me by such a wild accusation! It is infamous.” “Infamous, is it? What about this?” Stooping, he again detached the hair, and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He advanced towards her. “You permit that I see whether it matches?” With a cry she started backwards, white to the lips. “It is false I swear it. I know nothing of the crime of either crime.",0
"It contained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.  (From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Johannesburg,  March 7th. Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at once that we should go off to Pretoria.",0
"Always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man and a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case? I will tell you it does not fit in, and so we shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of working? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy balloon swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he despises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon comme ça!” And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he resumed: “Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak.",0
"""What?” “Imitation, mon ami.” The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!” “Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm. “Where?” “We must tell the Opalsens at once.” “I think not.” “But that poor woman” “Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.” “But the thief may escape with them!” “As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs.",0
"Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there. I admit that I haven’t had time to examine them yet, but I notice that one is of a totally different weight to the others, rattles in a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down with seccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener. The case seems clear, does it not? And now, you see, I have you both nicely in the trap. It’s a pity that you didn’t take kindly to the idea of becoming Lady Pedler.” I did not answer. I stood looking at him. There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph. “According to plan,” he said softly. “You amateurs will pit yourselves against professionals.” “What’s the meaning of this?” cried Harry hoarsely. “It means that you have walked into my parlour said the spider to the fly,” remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. “My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.” “You said I could come safely, Anne?” “Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself. She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room and found yourself in the hands of your enemies!” Harry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to Sir Eustace. “Yes,” murmured the latter, “decidedly you are not lucky! This is let me see, the third encounter.” “You are right,” said Harry. “This is the third encounter. Twice you have worsted me have you never heard that the third time the luck changes? This is my round cover him, Anne.” I was all ready. In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order. The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know.",0
"He is the sort of man who never notices legs himself or, if he does, would die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way, you’d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for me.” “Surely you will not go in fancy dress?” said Pagett, in tones of horror. I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained.",0
"Hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay on the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having managed to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy, lying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart. Madame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep, she had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries, they had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous “secret.",0
"Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!” (Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!) “Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?” “Yes, their name is Baker.” The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us.",0
"He looked at me. “You’ve made a mistake, I think,” he said, smiling. “Oh, no,” I said. “I’m sure I haven’t.” “You’ve given me the wrong roll. This is an unexposed one.” I walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is good for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be! But nobody relishes the process. And then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices, I came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of one of the company’s boats, and it was labelled “Kenilworth Castle.” A wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went in.",0
"When she actually came forward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And yet I was not satisfied, mon ami. I was not satisfied.… “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before. If it was not Bella Duveen, the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one single proof against her! “And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea since, as she thought, it belonged to her sister. But if, by any chance, it was not her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings (it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told her as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out (according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession! “In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open. By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a desperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted that I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions and failed!” “What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle. We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike. Even I did not suspect triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, mon ami! On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle.",0
"""Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes.",0
"""Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and well, that’s all, I think,” I concluded lamely. “And her husband?” “Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow nothing startling.” “Dark or fair?” “I don’t know betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of face.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, there are hundreds of these average men and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.” “They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t think for an instant” Poirot raised his hand. “Tout doucement, mon ami. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see” Poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed to be amusing him vastly. “And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!” “What on earth” “And stars give light! Voilà! Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.” I accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot addressed himself: “Pardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?” The porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out: “No. 4. Second floor.” “I thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?” “Six months.” I started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirot’s malicious grin. “Impossible,” I cried. “You must be making a mistake.” “Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.” He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside. “Eh bien, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?” I did not reply. Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going. “To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.” We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests: “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?” “Yes somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think” “That you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.” The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher. The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below. “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.” I craned my neck over the staircase. “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper. “Good. Wait awhile.” About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat. “C’est ça. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.” “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily. Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift. “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us. The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.” He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly. “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously. Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring: “Not precisely to-day,” he replied. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open. “You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes though not always then and it is against that that we are going to make provision.” He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain. On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?” “Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one of your efforts of fancy.” “It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government that of Japan, for example.",0
"Before we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and Japp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was Poirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of my friend. “How did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?” Poirot smiled placidly at him. “Ah, mon ami, after your wire, it was a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. Jewels, ready money, bearer bonds all so conveniently arranged for whom? Well, the good Monsieur Davenheim was of those who ‘look after Number One’ as your saying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged for himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery! How simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put away in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track. His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with Mr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the house where?” Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg. He frowned. “It is really insupportable,” he murmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!” “Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars that is, if you know!” “Eh bien, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!” “Do you know where he is hiding?” “Certainly! It is most ingenious.” “For the Lord’s sake, tell us, then!” Poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate, placed them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat effect, and then beamed affectionately on us both. “Come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the question which I asked myself. ‘If I were this man, where should I hide?’ Hastings, what do you say?” “Well,” I said, “I’m rather inclined to think I’d not do a bolt at all. I’d stay in London in the heart of things, travel by tubes and buses; ten to one I’d never be recognized. There’s safety in a crowd.” Poirot turned inquiringly to Japp. “I don’t agree. Get clear away at once that’s the only chance. I would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I’d have a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I’d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began!” We both looked at Poirot.",0
"""Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here I don’t want to rub it in in any way but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me.",0
"“I thought you were my secretary,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. Thursday night. We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds? At last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems that she’s a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs. Blair’s cabin, she must have been reading aloud all her special articles for years to come.",0
"Also I wanted to ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received?” Lady Yardly shook her head regretfully. “I’m afraid I don’t. It is stupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them seriously.” “You’ll stay the night?” said Lord Yardly. “Oh, milord, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at the inn.” “That’s all right.” Lord Yardly had his cue. “We’ll send down for them. No, no no trouble, I assure you.",0
"To begin with, Black answered well within the normal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘Day’ to ‘Night’ and ‘Place’ to ‘Name’ are normal associations. I began work with ‘Bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all. Evidently he had not. After our recent conversation, he gave ‘Dinner’ to my ‘Tuesday,’ but ‘Journey’ and ‘Country’ were answered by ‘Ship’ and ‘Uganda,’ showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here. ‘Story’ recalls to him one of the ‘Lion’ stories he told at dinner. I proceed to ‘Rook Rifle’ and he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘Farm.’ When I say ‘Shot,’ he answers at once ‘Suicide.’ The association seems clear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere. Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.” Black was straightforward enough over the matter. “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what” “What has it got to do with Mr. Maltravers? You did not know, I see, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.” “You mean my story suggested to him oh, but that is awful!” “Do not distress yourself it would have been one way or another. Well, I must get on the telephone to London.” Poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back thoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was not till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off no longer, but must break the news to the young widow. My sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless, and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I cherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He evidently admired her enormously. Our interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to believe the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty. Poirot was very sorry for the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance Company, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said gently to Mrs. Maltravers: “Madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!” “What do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide. “Have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? You are mediumistic, you know.” “I have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism, surely?” “Madame, I have seen some strange things.",0
"Then I saw.… “You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening?” “But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the 11:40.” My brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant anxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime.",0
"""It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “Dear M.",0
"On the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to clean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open. Hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay on the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having managed to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy, lying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart. Madame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep, she had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries, they had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous “secret.” But the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their request. Angered by his refusal, one of the men incontinently stabbed him through the heart. With the dead man’s keys, they had opened the safe in the corner, and had carried away with them a mass of papers. Both men were heavily bearded, and had worn masks, but Madame Beroldy declared positively that they were Russians. The affair created an immense sensation. It was referred to variously as “the Nihilist Atrocity,” “Revolutionaries in Paris,” and the “Russian Mystery.” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were never traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die down, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. The trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and beauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to make of it a cause célèbre. People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm. The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal blood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination. It was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy’s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the outskirts of Lyons. The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and the political schemes all the stories current were traced back to the lady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the “Crown jewels” the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his wife. The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American.",0
"” Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required.",0
" Johannesburg,  March 6th. There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi if you do, strikers pull you out again.",0
"“Still, you know, he is superstitious, the old man. Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these fortune-telling people. She prophesied a lifetime of success, but declared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.” He had interested her now. She looked up eagerly. “That is strange, very strange! Through a woman, you say?” He smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “Doubtless, now that he has retired, he will marry. Some young society beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he acquired them.” Nadina shook her head. “No, no, that is not the way of it.",0
"I was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her.",0
"""You may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it, and yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the market when Mrs. Robinson arrived.” “That shows that there must be something wrong about it.” “Mrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious, is it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?” “She was a delightful creature!” “Évidemment! since she renders you incapable of replying to my question. Describe her to me, then.",0
"But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.",0
"“Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.",0
"She had got in with a bad lot, he told me and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story.",0
"They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of about forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four. Count Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man paused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted that, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed immediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on.",0
"“Her husband?” I gasped. Poirot nodded. “Her husband or Georges Conneau, whichever you like to call him.” I rallied myself. “But it’s impossible.” “How ‘impossible?’ Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was in a position to blackmail Georges Conneau?” “Yes, but ” “And did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld?” “That may be true enough, but ” “And is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld’s youth and upbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?” “All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.” “What is it, my friend?” “Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!” “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot placidly, “that is just what he did do!” In a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition. “It seems strange to you, mon ami, that a man should plan his own death? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you he did not intend to die.” I shook my head, bewildered. “But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told you, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a different angle. “Georges Conneau flies from justice to Canada. There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts, takes him to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the one person who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold mine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to take advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds him heavily. “And then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the beautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That rouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father’s past, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape death.",0
"He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch.",0
"Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained.",0
"For the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with M. Renauld père, and pass to the next chronological event.” “May 23rd,” I read, “M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don’t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.” “We agree, mon ami at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M.",0
"It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned to her. “Marthe, dear ” But the girl shook her head. “No, maman, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate. “You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder ” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you?” “Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?” “Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.” “Ah!” she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult me! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness to leave my house!” The honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought. Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand. “There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A few hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your investigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?” “Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.” With mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards Merlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Geneviève. “The French police system is very marvellous,” said Poirot, looking after them. “The information they possess about every one’s life, down to the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only been here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted with M. Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.” “Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. Maman will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “Mon ami,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she is beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned. “Mon Dieu! But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when ” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.” “You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then ” “Eh bien?” “Well, we are hunting together again, and ” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, mon ami, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. Sacré! if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture and in connection with some case. I rather fancy ” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!” We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation. Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, la pauvre dame! She will eat nothing but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, par exemple, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack ma foi! they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his train. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall. The automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to run for the station. I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and his face was white white with two burning spots of red. Ah, but he was angry!” Léonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly. “And the dispute, what was it about?” “Ah, that I do not know,” confessed Léonie. “It is true that they shouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so fast, that only one well acquainted with English could have comprehended. But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day! Impossible to please him!” The sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity. “And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.” “One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “Quelle idée,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the salon. It is cool there on this hot morning.” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind ” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?” “Well, I’d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he’s anywhere about, and see what he’s up to.” “The human foxhound,” murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a comfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “By all means, my friend. Au revoir.” I strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the path we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation. She not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an exclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella! The surprise was mutual. “You,” we both exclaimed simultaneously. The young lady recovered herself first. “My only Aunt!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” “For the matter of that, what are you?” I retorted. “When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home to England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket to and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?” I ignored the end of the speech. “When last I saw you,” I said, “you were trotting home with your sister, like a good little girl. By the way, how is your sister?” A flash of white teeth rewarded me. “How kind of you to ask! My sister is well, I thank you.” “She is here with you?” “She remained in town,” said the minx with dignity. “I don’t believe you’ve got a sister,” I laughed. “If you have, her name is Harris!” “Do you remember mine?” she asked, with a smile. “Cinderella. But you’re going to tell me the real one now, aren’t you?” She shook her head with a wicked look. “Not even why you’re here?” “Oh, that! I suppose you’ve heard of members of my profession ‘resting.’” “At expensive French watering-places?” “Dirt cheap if you know where to go.” I eyed her keenly. “Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?” “We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously. “There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime at the Villa Geneviève ?” She stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean that you’re in on that?” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as she regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she remained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically. “Well, if that doesn’t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all the horrors.” “What do you mean?” “What I say. Bless the boy, didn’t I tell you I doted on crimes? What do you think I’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over this stubble? I’ve been nosing round for hours. Tried the front way in, but that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn’t taking any. I guess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in one wouldn’t cut ice with him! It’s a real piece of luck happening on you this way. Come on, show me all the sights.” “But look here wait a minute I can’t. Nobody’s allowed in. They’re awfully strict.” “Aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?” I was loath to relinquish my position of importance. “Why are you so keen?” I asked weakly. “And what is it you want to see.” “Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the body, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I’ve never had a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It’ll last me all my life?” I turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s ghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women were. Now I knew. They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any price, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs. When you got called to this job, did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed up in it?” “No, but ” “If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the same as I am? Of course you would.” “I’m a man.",0
"I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly. “But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.” “Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.” Mr. Chichester did not reply. “Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally. “To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.” “I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely it. Too much so perhaps. Was he or was he not just a little like a stage clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly. Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A a fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy. “But it is misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. “Aqua calda certainly ought to be cold water not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair. “They’re so obliging though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them the way somewhere, and instead of saying ‘first to the right, second to the left’ or something that one could follow, they pour out a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered they take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with you.” “Is that your experience in Florence, Pagett?” asked Sir Eustace, turning with a smile to his secretary. For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He stammered and flushed. “Oh, quite so, yes er quite so.” Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table. “I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race. “Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair” “Our friend, Mrs.",0
"An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend. His eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to the uttermost. “I have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.” Major Norman moved hastily to the door. “I’ll order the car.” “There is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has fallen.” “Do you mean you are going to walk, sir?” “No, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea by boat.” “To cross the sea?” “Yes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And the beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return to England.",0
"A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. “Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.",0
"“Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.” Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion.",0
"""But it could not deceive M. Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “You mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable proof. Madame Renauld’s story was false a fabrication from beginning to end. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband yet she lied to shield his murderer. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for herself, usually for the man she loves, always for her children. That is the last the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.” Giraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily. “That is my case,” said Giraud. “What have you to say to it?” “Only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.",0
"“All goes well? But do not tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in your lake, because I shall not believe you.” “We haven’t found the body, but we did find his clothes the identical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to that?” “Any other clothes missing from the house?” “No, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his wardrobe is intact. There’s more. We’ve arrested Lowen. One of the maids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares that she saw Lowen coming towards the study through the rose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten minutes before he left the house.",0
"""But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.” “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door.",0
"Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.” And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar.",0
"“I wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me? A woman’s hair h’m!” We lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris. “Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find this.” He took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the reproduction of a woman’s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an exclamation. “You recognize it, my friend?” I nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back, and the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was unmistakable.",0
"So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear. We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M.",0
"” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds. All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client. Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking, with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child. Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once. “You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice.",0
"Since it was to Jack Renauld’s advantage that the body should be found without delay, why dig a grave at all?” Giraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance. Poirot moved towards the door. I followed him. “There is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,” he said over his shoulder. “What is that?” “The piece of lead piping,” said Poirot, and left the room. Jack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we came out of the salon, he looked up sharply. At the same moment there was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was descending it.",0
"He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate.",0
"It’s mainly owing to him, and to his large subscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a say in the designing of it.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. Then he remarked: “It was not a very good choice they made of a spot to bury the body? When the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been discovered.” “Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that proves that they were strangers to the place. It’s an excellent piece of indirect evidence.” “Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body there unless unless they wanted it to be discovered.",0
"“Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics.",0
"There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured.",0
"“I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.” “Has he any relatives in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.” “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?” “That point has not been overlooked.",0
"There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! “My God, Poirot!” I cried. “Look at her hand, her right hand. It’s all red!” Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. “Blood,” she cried hysterically. “Yes, it’s blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he’s come back!” Her voice died away in a gurgle. “Lights,” said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic.",0
"I did not like to ask Poirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings. We alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something sharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the steps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously. A light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was opened cautiously a little way.",0
"Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently.",0
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to the sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish, hiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre décors. In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It was the Manager.",0
"By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country.",0
"“Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not last night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.",0
"“I have made all arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned.",0
"But to my intense surprise I heard a light footfall on the deck behind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned. “I want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last night.” “It it was a peculiar night,” I said hastily. It was not a very lucid remark, but it was absolutely the only thing I could think of. “Will you forgive me?” I held out my hand without a word. He took it. “There’s something else I want to say.” His gravity deepened.",0
"""Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?” “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow.",0
"Then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear. “Look, mon ami!” cried Poirot in triumph. I looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was dated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike, confectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman. “But is it legal?” I gasped. “As far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the testator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.",0
"She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far.",0
"You know what women are. She’s all for this film stunt.” “I comprehend,” said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought, then rose briskly to his feet. “You return to Yardly Chase at once? Bien! Say no word to anyone to anyone mind but expect us there this evening. We will arrive shortly after five.” “All right, but I don’t see” “Ça n’a pas d’importance,” said Poirot kindly. “You will that I preserve for you your diamond, n’est-ce pas?” “Yes, but” “Then do as I say.” A sadly bewildered nobleman left the room. It was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs.",0
"The man in the corner raised a meek voice. “Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?” The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough. “Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don’t be offended. You’ve asked questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.” I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall. “You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?” “Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened.",0
"He came out furious from the interview his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me.",0
"And think of me sometimes, comfortably putting on weight amidst the fleshpots! Your loving friend, Suzanne Blair. P.S. I am sending you an assortment of frying-pans as a wedding present, and an enormous terrine of pâté de foie gras to remind you of me. There is another letter that I sometimes read. It came a good while after the other and was accompanied by a bulky packet. It appeared to be written from somewhere in Bolivia.",0
"Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true.",0
"""What is that?” “A mistake even a little mistake on the part of the murderer.” He stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and shook his head. “Monsieur,” he said to the manager, “explain to me, I pray, your system of serving meals here.” The manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall. “This is the service lift,” he explained. “It runs to the kitchens at the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and the dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic worries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant.",0
"It seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded at the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted a policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street with Miller and saw him. He’s sober enough now, and I don’t mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting he might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer one it is. “He was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins was his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a bad day, and was down on his luck.",0
"I will rejoin you later.” It was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders.",0
"""He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.” “But no notecase.” “Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.” I tried another tack. “You don’t think it’s odd that the doctor never came forward afterwards?” “A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers. He probably forgot all about the accident.” “In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I said sweetly. “Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know fond of mysteries and such-like. But as I’m a busy man” I took the hint and rose.",0
"I turned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an interest in his story. “Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me.",0
"I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face. I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board.",0
"” I had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed another figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in the rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew who it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic in the peaceful morning sunlight. What must he have thought of me? It made me hot to realize the things that I had said. And I hadn’t meant them or had I? I turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain. If Rayburn had come up here to be alone, I, at least, need not disturb him by advertising my presence.",0
"“He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.” This was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly. “A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah ” I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me. “This is out of the ordinary, mon ami. Read for yourself.” The letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold characteristic hand: “Villa Geneviève Merlinville-sur-Mer France “Dear Sir, “I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I will give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have heard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be discreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account of a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life. I am convinced that the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if you will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several years of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee. “Assuring you once more that the matter is urgent, “Yours faithfully “P. T. RENAULD.” Below the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “For God’s sake, come!” I handed the letter back with quickened pulses. “At last!” I said. “Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.” “Yes, indeed,” said Poirot meditatively. “You will go of course,” I continued. Poirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his mind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave. “See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty of time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion. You accompany me, n’est-ce pas?” “Well ” “You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.” “Oh, that’s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.” “Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the name?” “There’s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name’s Renauld. I don’t know whether it could be the same.” “But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago.",0
"""Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror.",0
"” Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the moment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question. I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the Daily Budget.",0
"Immediately, with an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang from her chair towards him. “There now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do. It was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I’ve a feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.” “Calm yourself, I pray of you, madame.” Poirot patted her hand soothingly. “Reassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot will aid you!” Mr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector.",0
"I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance. Finally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no such place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There must be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find.",0
"You’re so young, Anne, and so beautiful with the kind of beauty that sends men mad. All the world’s before you love, life, everything. Mine’s behind me scorched, spoiled, with a taste of bitter ashes.” “If you don’t want me” “You know I want you. You know that I’d give my soul to pick you up in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for ever and ever. And you’re tempting me, Anne. You, with your long witch’s hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green and never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I’ll save you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night.",0
"Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise !” he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. “Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and ” “You will not have to send far, M. le juge.” The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window.",0
"One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, mon ami, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air. On the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car had been sent to meet us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit. “Since it is carte blanche, we will hire a car,” he said cheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of Merlinville. My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings. It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition a je ne sais quoi!” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction. “The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us.",0
"And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people.",0
"” Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler’s diary, of which he has kindly begged me to make use. So here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures. I’d always longed for adventures. You see, my life had such a dreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England’s greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really was a genius every one admits that. His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic times, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body inhabited the modern world.",0
"You shall go to Beira” “I’m not going to Beira,” I interrupted. “You are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself and throw you on to the boat. What do you think I’m made of? Do you think I’ll wake up night after night, fearing they’ve got you? One can’t go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back to England, Anne and and marry and be happy.” “With a steady man who’ll give me a good home!” “Better that than utter disaster.” “And what of you?” His face grew grim and set. “I’ve got my work ready to hand. Don’t ask what it is.",0
"That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly ” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot.",0
"""I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that leads us?” “Where we were when we started.” “Jamais de la vie! If the package was thrown overboard, and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in London.” “Yes, but then” Poirot waved an impatient hand. “Permit me to continue.",0
"I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me.",0
"She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much.",0
"I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused.",0
"“Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in my power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press ever so little. “Like this and squeeze the life out of you! And then like our unconscious friend here, but with more success fling your dead body to the sharks.",0
"She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!” “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!” “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.” “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.” “Mon Dieu! but how you enrage yourself for nothing, mon ami!” “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door.",0
"It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her.",0
"Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! Un moment, s’il vous plaît.” I joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly startled, came running up to the hedge at his call. “A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?” “Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.” Despite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid. “Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast.",0
"At last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with a grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet us. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I’m sorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans.” Poirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush, stayed its course. “Not another death?” he breathed. “Yes.” “Sir Guy Willard?” I cried. “No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.” “And the cause?” demanded Poirot. “Tetanus.” I blanched.",0
"“Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it.",0
"I fished about until I found some old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over my bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth. The whole effect pleased me very much. “Anna the Adventuress,” I said aloud, nodding at my reflection. “Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, ‘The House in Kensington’!” Girls are foolish things. In the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored. Mrs.",0
"Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed.",0
"Dressed precisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel. “And my boots,” he wailed. “Regard them, Hastings. My boots, of the neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the sand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which outrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to become limp but limp!” “Look at the Sphinx,” I urged. “Even I can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales.” Poirot looked at it discontentedly. “It has not the air happy,” he declared. “How could it, half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion.",0
"Ah, this cursed sand!” “Come, now, there’s a lot of sand in Belgium,” I reminded him, mindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “les dunes impeccables” as the guide-book had phrased it. “Not in Brussels,” declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids thoughtfully. “It is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid and geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they plant them in rows!” I cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start for the camp.",0
"” I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home orphans without consulting me first. “We will send her a wire from the station,” continued the lawyer. My few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat sadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a “Mary” hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out but doesn’t! A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim.",0
"There’s safety in a crowd.” Poirot turned inquiringly to Japp. “I don’t agree. Get clear away at once that’s the only chance. I would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I’d have a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I’d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began!” We both looked at Poirot. “What do you say, monsieur?” For a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted across his face.",0
"“Ah, that is just what I do not understand! It is inexplicable stupid! They have all their arrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the abduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost impossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not twenty miles from London!” “Perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other,” I suggested. “Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor in the first affair, anyway.",0
"Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead. A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime.",0
"“You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to find one soon, or it’s a washout.” “One more question, permettez Lady Yardly, which plan does she approve?” “Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel.",0
"Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others. “Mother!” “Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what brings you here? You were to sail on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others, she turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.",0
"Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably.",0
"I had been madly in love with her for the moment I even think that I frightened her sometimes but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead.",0
"You’re a thief, remember, a thief. There’s one thing you don’t know, perhaps. I’ve got the diamonds. And here goes” With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite. “There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we’ll talk. I’ll drive a bargain with you. You’ve got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. There’s a chance for me if I can get away. I’m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man! There’s a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes’ start and I shall be all right.",0
"We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.",0
"A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler. Lady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward uncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little man was equal to the occasion. “All my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss Marvell’s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure.",0
"""Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl. You’ll have to trust me and hope for the best. Of course, if you’re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that’s another matter.",0
"We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “Pardon! But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “Toqué!” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “Toqué!” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting. Eh bien, once or twice, your manner has annoyed me.” “I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.",0
"“Won’t you just stay and have something to eat?” We accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs. We had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the door, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The parlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart. “It was a man standing in the passage.” Poirot rushed out, returning quickly. “There is no one there.” “Isn’t there, sir?” said the parlourmaid weakly. “Oh, it did give me a start!” “But why?” She dropped her voice to a whisper.",0
"Davenheim left the house?” “About half-past five or thereabouts.” “What lies beyond the rose-garden?” “A lake.” “With a boathouse?” “Yes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you’re thinking of suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don’t mind telling you that Miller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged. That’s the kind of man he is!” Poirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “Hastings, I pray you, hand me that copy of the Daily Megaphone. If I remember rightly, there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.” I rose, and found the sheet required. Poirot studied the features attentively. “H’m!” he murmured. “Wears his hair rather long and wavy, full moustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?” “Yes.” “Hair and beard turning grey?” The detective nodded. “Well, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to say to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?” “On the contrary, most obscure.” The Scotland Yard man looked pleased. “Which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished Poirot placidly. “Eh?” “I find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear as daylight eh bien, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.” Japp shook his head almost pityingly. “Well, each to their fancy. But it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.” “I do not see,” murmured Poirot. “I shut my eyes and think.” Japp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.” “And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?” “Certainly. That’s in the bargain.” “Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. “Like robbing a child!” I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room. “Eh bien!” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?” He shook his finger at me. “You do not trust his grey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.” “The lake!” I said significantly. “And even more than the lake, the boathouse!” I looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to question him further. We heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he walked in about nine o’clock. I saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind. “Eh bien, my friend,” remarked Poirot. “All goes well? But do not tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in your lake, because I shall not believe you.” “We haven’t found the body, but we did find his clothes the identical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to that?” “Any other clothes missing from the house?” “No, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his wardrobe is intact. There’s more.",0
"""Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted.",0
"Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious “Colonel.” Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was steaming out to sea.",0
"“But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you why was I not told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child ” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs.",0
"Finally we were politely bowed out. “I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street. “You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.” “It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, mon ami. I do not expect to find in a Bank manager a ‘keen financier with an eagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am disappointed in the case it is too easy!” “Easy?” “Yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?” “You know who stole the bonds?” “I do.” “But then we must why” “Do not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going to do anything at present.",0
"We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment maman called me from the house, and I had to go. That is all, only I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie.",0
"He likes out of-the-way parts of the world.” “No one else goes with you?” Jack flushed. “You mean ?” “A girl who loves you very dearly who has been willing to lay down her life for you.” “How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened, could I go to her and oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?” “Les femmes they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.” “Yes, but I’ve been such a damned fool!” “So have all of us, at one time and another,” observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack’s face had hardened. “There’s something else.",0
"""Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren’t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?” I demanded irritably. “I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.” Trust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it! “Well?” “I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir Eustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I thought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked about him. He slunk up the stairs by the saloon. I followed him.",0
"le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Eh bien, speaking frankly in confidence, c’est entendu can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M.",0
"""I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is ill in bed influenza.” His face fell. “Dear me, that is a great blow to me.” “The matter on which you want to consult him is serious?” “My God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was foully murdered last night.” “Here in London?” “No, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to come round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.” “If you will excuse me a minute,” I said, struck by a sudden idea. I rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with the situation. He took any further words out of my mouth. “I see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not? You should know my methods by now. All I ask is that you should report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any instructions I may wire you.” To this I willingly agreed. An hour later I was sitting opposite Mr. Havering in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, speeding rapidly away from London. “To begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunter’s Lodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is only a small shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors. Our real home is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town for the season. Hunter’s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional week-end. Of course, during the shooting season, we take down some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss Pace of New York), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. He never got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me. Of course I am a poor man, and my uncle was a rich one in other words, he paid the piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on. This morning I received this telegram.” He handed it over to me: “Come at once uncle Harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do come Zoe.” “Then, as yet you know no details?” “No, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the police are in charge.” It was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station of Elmer’s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors. “A lonely place,” I observed with a shiver. Havering nodded. “I shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.” We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us. “Japp!” I ejaculated. The Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion. “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.” “My wife” “I’ve seen your good lady, sir and the housekeeper. I won’t keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.” “I know nothing as yet as to what” “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly. “But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?” “He’s ill in bed with influenza.” “Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?” And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr. Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.” “What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.” I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality. I introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension. “Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur Poirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair?” “Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man arrived?” “It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?” “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.” “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.” “What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station. I found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see the body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man, typically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters. “Turned away for a moment,” remarked Japp, “and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.” “What do you think of the case?” I asked, as we left the gruesome chamber behind us. “Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!” noting my exclamation of astonishment. “Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!” “Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?” Japp winked. “I think it grew pretty fast grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that we’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I’m sorry Mrs. Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.” I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question. And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst I was at breakfast the following morning: “Of course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic.” It seemed to me that Poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious. I also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case. His request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was able to. At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot: “Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.” Dumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath. “He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something in it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don’t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up right away, and take another look at her.” But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary wearing apparel.",0
"“I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not.",0
"Renauld? Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night, some one who would benefit by his death the description fits Jack Renauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point. “Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There were two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that.",0
"I’ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways, Monsieur Poirot and I’m head over ears in debt but I want to pull up. I’m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten things up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf is offering me big money enough to set me on my feet again. I don’t want to do it I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the Chase but I may have to, unless” He broke off. Poirot eyed him keenly.",0
"We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds. Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke. “I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.” The girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall. “Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.” But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle.",0
"“Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.” After bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me. “Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?” “Well, I suppose Ascanio is right somebody impersonated him.” “Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn.",0
"We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud. Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them.",0
"” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure.",0
"He was a man who once loved me.” “In South Africa?” asked the Count negligently. “Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.” “That is your native country, is it not?” She nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. “Well,” he remarked, “you know your own business best, but, if I were you, I should fear the ‘Colonel’ far more than any disillusioned lover. He is a man whom it is particularly easy to underestimate.” She laughed scornfully. “As if I did not know him after all these years!” “I wonder if you do?” he said softly. “I very much wonder if you do.",0
"You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What beau temps, is it not? Good day, milord.” And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands. “Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?” “No, mon ami, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.” “How did you get the diamond.” “From Mr. Rolf.” “Rolf?” “Mais oui! The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in Society Gossip, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike bah! they did not exist.",0
"His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with Mr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the house where?” Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg. He frowned.",0
"” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly.",0
"“But where did their ‘method’ break down?” “Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark” “I remember,” I cried. “Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!” There was a moment’s silence. “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me. “This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed.",0
"He was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange beard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself. I was in the hands of the enemy. It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.” How often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It’s all very well on the screen you have the comfortable knowledge that there’s bound to be an Episode IV.",0
"Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so.",0
"She now tempted me with the advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the boat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry land. Muffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was hauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay there with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired young man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me. “Hullo! Feeling rather sorry for yourself, eh?” “Yes,” I replied, hating him. “Ah, you won’t know yourself in another day or two. We’ve had rather a nasty dusting in the Bay, but there’s smooth weather ahead.",0
"In feature, little to take hold of, a man difficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of account. He bowed over the dancer’s hand with exaggerated courtliness. “Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.” So much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind her. Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina’s smile. “Compatriots though we are, we will not speak Russian, I think,” she observed. “Since we neither of us know a word of the language, it might be as well,” agreed her guest.",0
"For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me.",0
"My sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless, and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I cherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He evidently admired her enormously. Our interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to believe the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty.",0
"” This was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly. “A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah ” I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me. “This is out of the ordinary, mon ami. Read for yourself.",0
"“Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.” There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks. “You know?” she gasped. “How?” I smiled. “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters” “Miss Marvell? She has been here?” “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same.",0
"“My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?” “Oh, yes.” “Your father, as you know, was a very great man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.” I knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so. He continued: “I do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try to explain as clearly as I can.” He explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that I was left to face life with the sum of £87, 17s. 4d. It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next.",0
“He’s been with me eight years a most trustworthy fellow.” My interlocutor smiled. “We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.” “Miss Pettigrew?” I exclaimed. “Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop.” “God bless my soul!” I interrupted. “I was going into that place myself this afternoon. You might have caught me coming out!” There doesn’t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in Jo’burg without being suspected for it. “Ah! but she has been there more than once and in rather doubtful circumstances.,0
"Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.” Black was straightforward enough over the matter. “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what” “What has it got to do with Mr.",0
"“To-morrow you’ll have some questions to answer, and after you’ve answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we’ve more ways than one of making obstinate little fools talk.” It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until to-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.",0
"40 on the following afternoon and depart again at 6. I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed to me a good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was getting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got another chance. The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from Johannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram: “Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.” Eric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name I dislike exceedingly.",0
"“You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and what is more send his son there?” “It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.” Poirot shook his head.",0
"But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock something would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time.",0
"I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment possibly with the murderer leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No and there ought to have been. Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots in the other, none! You see? Some one had passed that way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.” “Where did they get a rake?” “Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot impatiently. “There is no difficulty about that.” “What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, mon ami.” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me.",0
"It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that all alone. You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.” “Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. “Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.” “Are you sure you’re all right now?” “Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.” She flashed a smile at me. “That’s so. Au revoir, then.” “Wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?” “Oh, I’m staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It’s a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow.” “I will,” I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary empressement. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed. Fortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the sergent de ville. And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key kept? Parbleu, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of value to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of assassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse’s time. M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man withdrew, grumbling to the last.",0
"Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement. “Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it.",0
"They were a pleasant couple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin, and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm. Tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s constant resting-place.",0
"“Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us. I took her hands in both of mine. My eyes said the rest. Poirot cleared his throat. “Mes enfants,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “Très bien, mon enfant,” said Poirot. “I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle ” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot. “I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping that is the great thing. Maman made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out.",0
"” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, mon ami.” “You are going to Paris? But why?” He replied very seriously. “To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.” “You think he is in Paris?” “I am quite certain that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I must look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to you in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris is necessary. I shall not be away long. In all probability I shall return tomorrow. I do not propose that you should accompany me. Remain here and keep an eye on Giraud. Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld fils. And thirdly, if you wish, endeavour to cut him out with Mademoiselle Marthe. But I fear you will not have great success.” I did not quite relish the last remark. “That reminds me,” I said. “I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?” “Mon ami I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering Léonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I decided on the latter. So I made my guess and I was right.” “And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?” Poirot smiled. “At any rate I saw that she had anxious eyes. That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes.…” His voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start.” “You’ve oceans of time.” “Perhaps perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.” “At all events,” I said, rising, “I will come and see you off.” “You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.” He was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded emphatically. “I mean it, mon ami. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it is not the English custom. Une poignee de main, alors.” I felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down the beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to join them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her.",0
"Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have. How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death. I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions. All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans and make them quickly. Pagett is staying behind here you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia which is very annoying, because I want to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted. “I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool.",0
"Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what your plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.” “But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France without delay.” “We?” “Precisely ‘we!’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish ” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight.",0
"I have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point.” The Daily Newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events. Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed.",0
"She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her.",0
"It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa.",0
"He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly. I, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm. “I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late if you go yourself.” Poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two. “Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram.” At that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the Flying Corps. “This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France.",0
"I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same one feels the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. “Better lift you,” he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture. I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of me, staring into my face. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he said abruptly. “I’m a gipsy seeing the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext. You’ve not the soul of the journalist. You’re out for your own hand snatching at life. But that’s not all.” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I said slowly, “that you are really connected with the Government that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden again. No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of them all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I offered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously. I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it. “Oh,” I cried indignantly, “they’re starved! It’s wicked. Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t don’t,” I said fiercely. “I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.",0
"He was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand. I recognized the five-pointed star or Pentagon many times repeated. As was his wont, Poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general, White Magic as opposed to Black, with various references to the Ka and the Book of the Dead thrown in. It appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in Dr. Tosswill, who drew me aside, literally snorting with rage. “Balderdash, sir,” he exclaimed angrily. “Pure balderdash. The man’s an impostor. He doesn’t know the difference between the superstitions of the Middle Ages and the beliefs of Ancient Egypt. Never have I heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.” I calmed the excited expert, and joined Poirot in the tent. My little friend was beaming cheerfully. “We can now sleep in peace,” he declared happily. “And I can do with some sleep. My head, it aches abominably. Ah, for a good tisane!” As though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and Hassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to Poirot. It proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately fond. Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert. “A wonderful place,” I said aloud, “and a wonderful work. I can feel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel the charm?” I got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was quickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude couch, his face horribly convulsed. Beside him was the empty cup. I rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to Dr. Ames’s tent. “Dr. Ames!” I cried. “Come at once.” “What’s the matter?” said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas. “My friend. He’s ill. Dying. The camomile tea. Don’t let Hassan leave the camp.” Like a flash the doctor ran to our tent. Poirot was lying as I left him. “Extraordinary,” cried Ames. “Looks like a seizure or what did you say about something he drank?” He picked up the empty cup. “Only I did not drink it!” said a placid voice. We turned in amazement. Poirot was sitting up on the bed. He was smiling. “No,” he said gently. “I did not drink it. While my good friend Hastings was apostrophizing the night, I took the opportunity of pouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. That little bottle will go to the analytical chemist. No” as the doctor made a sudden movement “as a sensible man, you will understand that violence will be of no avail. During Hastings’ brief absence to fetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah, quick, Hastings, hold him!” I misunderstood Poirot’s anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung myself in front of him. But the doctor’s swift movement had another meaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds filled the air, and he swayed forward and fell. “Another victim,” said Poirot gravely, “but the last. Perhaps it is the best way. He has three deaths on his head.” “Dr. Ames?” I cried, stupefied. “But I thought you believed in some occult influence?” “You misunderstood me, Hastings. What I meant was that I believe in the terrific force of superstition. Once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down to the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race. I suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct. The idea came to him, I imagine, with the death of Sir John Willard. A fury of superstition arose at once. As far as I could see, nobody could derive any particular profit from Sir John’s death. Mr. Bleibner was a different case. He was a man of great wealth. The information I received from New York contained several suggestive points. To begin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion of his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him to Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet he was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must have lent him the money.” “All that was very thin,” I objected. “But there was more. Hastings, there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can happen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘I am a leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.” “What?” I ejaculated. “It was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the South Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough. Ames was a former friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never dream of doubting his word. When I arrived here, my suspicions were divided between Harper and Dr. Ames, but I soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and I learnt from Harper that he was previously acquainted with young Bleibner. Doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. The latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth. It was easy for him to inoculate Mr.",0
"There was no reply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang again and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no sign of life rewarded us. “This is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. He turned to the lift attendant. “Is there any pass-key to this door?” “There is one in the porter’s office downstairs.” “Get it, then, and, look here, I think you’d better send for the police.” Poirot approved with a nod of the head. The man returned shortly; with him came the manager. “Will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?” “Certainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying.",0
"Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London was uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, mon ami. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler.",0
"Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed maliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast. My friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful face upon me. “Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier? His system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “Quelle idée! You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.” “He did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot. I do not run to and fro, making journeys, and agitating myself. My work is done from within here ” he tapped his forehead significantly. As usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty. “It’s all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer.” “And has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked Poirot dryly. “But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules Poirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “Eh bien, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case.",0
"Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.” “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr.",0
"Also, by this ” And, leaning forward, he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see. It was a woman’s long black hair similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. Eh bien, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud.",0
"""That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.",0
"I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings.",0
"The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid a master stroke, ça!” “But what did you go to London for?” “You remember the card?” “Certainly. It puzzled me and puzzles me still. I thought” I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. “Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints.",0
"” I shuddered. Then a thought struck me. “You say you didn’t know I was there. What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he did not seem to notice. “How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?” I asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. “And what are you doing in this part of the world, anyway?” “I live here,” he said simply. “On this island?” “Yes, I came here after the War.",0
"” Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: “We thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson she’s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too came hurrying down the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said. ‘But it’s no good. It’s already let.’ That seemed to finish it, but well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium.",0
"“Pourquoi? Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit yes; but one cannot suspect institutions.” “Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,” I suggested. Poirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care. “That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal man can do.",0
"“Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course.",0
"Hautet doubtfully. “But it is possibly a little unfair on his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If she were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.” “It may be as you say. Now, M.",0
"She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost it’s what she must have thought me at first all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.",0
"“Amen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time. But this is dark dark. I cannot see.” “Well, Poirot,” I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the Ministers, “what do you think?” My friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft movements. He shook his head thoughtfully. “I do not know what to think. My brains desert me.” “Why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do as well?” I mused. “Pardon me, mon ami, but I did not quite say that.",0
"Together they drag him into the shed as we know, the event had occurred just outside and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no resemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French type. That is sufficient. “I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot from the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The identification must rest solely on Madame Renauld’s evidence. Jack Renauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must be got out of the way.",0
"‘I’ve left you nothing in my will,’ says he, ‘but each year I live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg when I’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.” Poirot reflected. “After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do you know?” “Went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.” That did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He held out the key of the desk. “Is that your master’s writing?” I may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed before Baker replied: “Yes, sir, it is.",0
"30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself it’s something about the eyes.” “I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.” “Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?” The man looked up at him and started. “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours. The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.” “What about the jewel-case?” I asked. “It was found in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing had been taken ‘the Western Star.’” We stared at each other the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal. Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?” “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf. “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?” “Certainly.” In about five minutes Poirot reappeared. “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.” “Who to?” “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine. “Come, come, mon ami. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! Bien! All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.” It was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught. “I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that” Poirot held up his hand. “My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.” “You but why? What?” The nobleman spluttered impotently. “My little idea was to bring things to a head,” explained Poirot placidly. “Bring things to a head! Oh, my God!” cried Lord Yardly. “And the ruse succeeded,” said Poirot cheerfully. “Therefore, milord, I have much pleasure in returning you this!” With a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object.",0
"“There must have been giants once,” I said dreamily. “And their children were just like children are to-day they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long well, it makes one what you would call cruel. One comes to hold life and death very lightly.” “Yes,” I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do though they are, I suppose. That is, they are nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength like lions and tigers” “And giraffes?” interpolated Colonel Race slyly. I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same one feels the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View.",0
"So we are forced to the second that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “Bien! Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but ” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love.” I shook my head perplexed. “Mais, oui, you know perfectly.",0
"“You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile.",0
"Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.” I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question.",0
"How should I not know you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.” “You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!” said my friend grandiloquently. “It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.” “We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge. “The injury is serious, then?” I asked. “What injury?” “The bullet wound.” “Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.” “As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed.",0
"I believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!” “Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!” “Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.” The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly. “Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,” explained the latter. “Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion.",0
"He had found” Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically. “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?” “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.” “Shooting rooks, eh?” “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.” “Where is this little rook rifle now?” “In the hall, I think.” She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.",0
"Not even a balcony outside.” “Even if there were,” said the inspector impatiently, “I don’t see how that would help us, if the maid never left the room.” “Évidemment,” said Poirot, not disconcerted. “As Mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room” He was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher. “Nothing,” said the latter laconically. “I should hope not, indeed,” said the chambermaid virtuously. “And that French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girl’s character!” “There, there, my girl; that’s all right,” said the inspector, opening the door. “Nobody suspects you. You go along and get on with your work.” The chambermaid went unwillingly. “Going to search her?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine. “Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key. Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her. The inspector’s face grew graver. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room.” Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully. “Si, si, mon enfant I assure you it is better not to resist.” Then he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little experiment purely for my own satisfaction.” “Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally. Poirot addressed Célestine once more. “You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it?” “On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.” “And the scissors?” “They also.” “Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?” Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned. Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand. “Again, if you please, mademoiselle.” At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket. “Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,” he bowed to the inspector “for your courtesy.” The inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness. Célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Then, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to work to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards, completely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked on sceptically. “You really think you will find them?” “Yes, sir. It stands to reason.",0
"The fact remains three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly afraid. It may not yet be the end.” “For whom do you fear?” “For my son. When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense” “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly. “I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.” I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest. “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.” “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?” “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.” “And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her. For my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject as we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest. “But yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not underrate the force of superstition.” “What are we going to do about it?” “Toujours pratique, the good Hastings! Eh bien, to begin with we are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr. Bleibner’s death.” He duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young Rupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead. A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime. The news of his uncle’s death reaches him. He realizes how unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes his own life. I outlined my solution to Poirot. He was interested. “It is ingenious what you have thought of there decidedly it is ingenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the fatal influence of the Tomb.” I shrugged my shoulders. “You still think that has something to do with it?” “So much so, mon ami, that we start for Egypt to-morrow.” “What?” I cried, astonished. “I have said it.” An expression of conscious heroism spread over Poirot’s face. Then he groaned. “But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!” It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids. The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot. Dressed precisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel. “And my boots,” he wailed. “Regard them, Hastings. My boots, of the neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the sand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which outrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to become limp but limp!” “Look at the Sphinx,” I urged. “Even I can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales.” Poirot looked at it discontentedly. “It has not the air happy,” he declared. “How could it, half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion. Ah, this cursed sand!” “Come, now, there’s a lot of sand in Belgium,” I reminded him, mindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “les dunes impeccables” as the guide-book had phrased it. “Not in Brussels,” declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids thoughtfully. “It is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid and geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they plant them in rows!” I cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start for the camp. We were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were patiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman. I pass over the spectacle of Poirot on a camel. He started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and invocations to the Virgin Mary and every Saint in the calendar. In the end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey. I must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur. I was stiff for several days. At last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with a grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet us. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I’m sorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans.” Poirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush, stayed its course. “Not another death?” he breathed. “Yes.” “Sir Guy Willard?” I cried. “No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.” “And the cause?” demanded Poirot. “Tetanus.” I blanched. All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil, subtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing I were the next? “Mon Dieu,” said Poirot, in a very low voice, “I do not understand this. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?” “I believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.” “Ah, of course, you are not the doctor.” “My name is Tosswill.” This, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as being a minor official at the British Museum. There was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy. “If you will come with me,” continued Dr. Tosswill, “I will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive.” We were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,” said Tosswill. The youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother. He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain. He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles. After a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames. “Please ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,” said Willard. “We are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters, but it isn’t it can’t be, anything but coincidence.” There was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly. “Your heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?” “Rather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is going on. Make up your mind to that.” Poirot wheeled round on the other. “What have you to say to that, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” drawled the doctor, “I’m not for quitting myself.” Poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his. “Then, évidemment, we must find out just how we stand. When did Mr. Schneider’s death take place?” “Three days ago.” “You are sure it was tetanus?” “Dead sure.” “It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for instance?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a clear case of tetanus.” “Did you not inject anti-serum?” “Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing that could be done was tried.” “Had you the anti-serum with you?” “No. We procured it from Cairo.” “Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?” “No, not one.” “Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to tetanus?” “Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.” “Then we have four deaths all totally dissimilar, one heart failure, one blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.” “Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together?” “I don’t quite understand you?” “I will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?” The doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment. “You’re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you’ve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk?” “Absolute nonsense,” muttered Willard angrily. Poirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his green cat’s eyes. “So you do not believe it, monsieur le docteur?” “No, sir, I do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “I am a scientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.” “Was there no science then in Ancient Egypt?” asked Poirot softly. He did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment. “No, no, do not answer me, but tell me this. What do the native workmen think?” “I guess,” said Dr. Ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads, natives aren’t going to be far behind. I’ll admit that they’re getting what you might call scared but they’ve no cause to be.” “I wonder,” said Poirot non-committally. Sir Guy leant forward. “Surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in oh, but the thing’s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you think that.” For answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket an ancient tattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans. Then, wheeling round, he strode out of the tent. The doctor stared at me. “What is his little idea?” The phrase, so familiar on Poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came from another. “I don’t know exactly,” I confessed. “He’s got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.” I went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced young man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner’s secretary. “No,” Mr. Harper was saying, “I’ve only been six months with the expedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner’s affairs pretty well.” “Can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?” “He turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I’d never met him before, but some of the others had Ames, I think, and Schneider. The old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. They were at it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘Not a cent,’ the old man shouted. ‘Not one cent now or when I’m dead. I intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my life’s work. I’ve been talking it over with Mr. Schneider to-day.’ And a bit more of the same. Young Bleibner lit out for Cairo right away.” “Was he in perfectly good health at the time?” “The old man?” “No, the young one.” “I believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But it couldn’t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.” “One thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?” “So far as we know, he has not.",0
"""Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain.",0
"” The doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the examining magistrate. “A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.” “And so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “Could it possibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among themselves.” Giraud shook his head. “The man is a Frenchman I would take my oath of that ” But at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression.",0
"I came out on to the stoep early on the following morning and looked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer’s wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the stoep_, a book in my hand which I did not read.",0
"In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the papers.” “Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked.",0
"We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it.",0
"Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town. I can alter my appearance a little wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window. Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard.",0
"It was soon evident that the fascinating Jeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the young man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her complete devotion to her middle-aged husband. Nevertheless, many spiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her lover and not the only one! When the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another personage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of the United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming and mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful. About this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried on her husband’s behalf. She explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a “secret” of far reaching European importance. They had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but Madame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members of the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. On the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to clean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open. Hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay on the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having managed to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy, lying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart. Madame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep, she had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries, they had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous “secret.” But the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their request. Angered by his refusal, one of the men incontinently stabbed him through the heart. With the dead man’s keys, they had opened the safe in the corner, and had carried away with them a mass of papers. Both men were heavily bearded, and had worn masks, but Madame Beroldy declared positively that they were Russians. The affair created an immense sensation. It was referred to variously as “the Nihilist Atrocity,” “Revolutionaries in Paris,” and the “Russian Mystery.” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were never traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die down, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. The trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and beauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to make of it a cause célèbre. People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm. The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal blood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination. It was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy’s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the outskirts of Lyons. The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and the political schemes all the stories current were traced back to the lady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the “Crown jewels” the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his wife. The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American. Throughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age. Absurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great number of people believed implicitly in their truth. But the prosecution was implacable. It denounced the masked “Russians” as a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame Beroldy and her lover, Georges Conneau. A warrant was issued for the arrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. Evidence showed that the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she could easily have freed herself. And then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris, was sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and, without revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of the crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at Madame Beroldy’s instigation. The crime had been planned between them. Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage.",0
"At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly. With an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at my friend. “Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about this. It’s from Hoffberg. He thinks he’s found a customer for the diamond an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They’re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if this goes through” Words failed him. Lady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her hand.",0
"The principal finds had been removed to Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting. The enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that I detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we entered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before joining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in Arabic. Poirot stopped.",0
"I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll.",0
"What about food?” “A little starvation will do no harm. The ‘Colonel’ will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely tied up?” The Dutchman laughed. “What do you think?” They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I beat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time the Kafir stirred and moved.",0
"I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions.",0
"I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs. “I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can.",0
"But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.” He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. “Information?” “Something of the kind.” “Diamonds,” I said to myself. “And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.” For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables.",0
"Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we started off in a northerly direction, the other car following close behind. We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds. Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke. “I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.” The girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall. “Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.” But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and poured into the house, shutting the door behind them. Norman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity. Finally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three prisoners a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were taken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by Poirot himself. “I must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this gentleman. You do not know him, no? Eh bien, let me present to you, Monsieur O’Murphy!” O’Murphy! I gaped at him open-mouthed as we started again. He was not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He sat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman and I would be more than a match for him. To my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not returning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the car slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon Aerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirot’s idea. He proposed to reach France by aeroplane. It was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A telegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave the personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others. As we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man took his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly. I, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm. “I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late if you go yourself.” Poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two. “Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram.” At that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the Flying Corps. “This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France. He can start at once.” “Wrap up warmly, sir,” said the young pilot. “I can lend you a coat, if you like.” Poirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself: “Yes, there is time just time.” Then he looked up, and bowed politely to the young officer. “I thank you, monsieur. But it is not I who am your passenger.",0
"Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?” I leaned back, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction. Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “I think that you should write for the Kinema, mon ami,” he remarked at last. “You mean ?” “It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me there but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.” “I admit that I haven’t gone into all the details, but ” “You have gone further you have ignored them magnificently.",0
"For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch.",0
"Then he went on towards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight ‘chink’ which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short search, discovered the ring! That is Kellett’s story. It’s only fair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word of a man like Kellett can’t be relied upon in the slightest. It’s within the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him.” Poirot shook his head. “Very improbable, mon ami. He had no means of disposing of the body. It would have been found by now.",0
"Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes.",0
"” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “Ça commence!” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “Mon ami, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I ” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing sergent de ville. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.",0
"Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied. “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!” “You are on the how do you say it? get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?” “Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.",0
"Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there God knows how long. They’ve blown up the railway line already, I hear. It isn’t even as if one could get a drink there. They put the place under martial law two days ago. “My dear fellow,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that I’m studying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study them from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don’t you worry about me. I shall be all right.",0
"I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well ” I felt flustered. “I I assumed it.” “Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, mon petit does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No.",0
"“Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?” “Of course I remember.” “I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.” “Was that what you meant?” “Of course.” I hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained. He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: “When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted me. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing.",0
"The Star of the East was missing! “That settles it,” I breathed. “These were no ordinary thieves. This one stone was all they wanted.” “But how did the fellow get in?” “Through this door.” “But it’s always locked.” I shook my head. “It’s not locked now. See.” I pulled it open as I spoke. As I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It was a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had been torn from a Chinaman’s robe. “In his haste it caught in the door,” I explained. “Come, hurry. He cannot have gone far as yet.” But in vain we hunted and searched.",0
"""And pray, what are they?” “One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last autumn.” “Poirot, you are joking!” “I am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not forget my little commission.” But the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about eleven o’clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read it out: “‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’” “Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!” I stared at him.",0
"Young Bleibner, some years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular will, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.",0
"English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.",0
"” He looked down at the body again. “As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wore gloves.” “You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. “Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared at the doorway. “Monsieur?” “Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago?” “She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.” “Good. I only want one at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared again.",0
"Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.",0
"Tosswill, “I will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive.” We were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,” said Tosswill. The youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother.",0
"I found it on the back of the leather chair.” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “Ma foi! but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.” “Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position. “He wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,” he remarked. “Yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.” At this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after him. He strode forward and opened it. Françoise was there. She endeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity. “Well, what is it?” demanded Bex impatiently. “Madame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite ready to receive the examining magistrate.",0
"After a moment or two, I said rather doubtfully: “As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.” “Blackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character and habits.” “Mrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,” I argued. “We have already seen that Madame Renauld’s testimony cannot be relied upon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.” “Still, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.” “None whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?” “The letter, Poirot.",0
"The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios. His name was Ned perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue.",0
"With a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted. “Quick in here.” Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so. “And you behind the curtain.” “Si, signor,” said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window. Not a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form. “Where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance.",0
"She was in delicate health and expecting” “Your wife? But I didn’t know you were married?” “No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived you in this matter.” “How long have you been married?” “Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I became your secretary. I did not want to lose the post. A resident secretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the fact.” “You take my breath away,” I remarked. “Where has she been all these years?” “We have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow, quite close to the Mill House, for over five years.” “God bless my soul,” I muttered. “Any children?” “Four children, Sir Eustace.” I gazed at him in a kind of stupor. I might have known, all along, that a man like Pagett couldn’t have a guilty secret. The respectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That’s just the kind of secret he would have a wife and four children. “Have you told this to any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.” I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance. “I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now that you’ve blinking well torn it!” I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in. The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands. “Can I show you something? Furs, curios?” “I want something quite out of the ordinary,” I said. “It’s for a special occasion. Will you show me what you’ve got?” “Perhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties there?” That is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so clever. I followed him through the swinging portières.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even wept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I got my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell. I arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met by a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He had a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in the distance, and I asked him what it was. “Guns,” he answered laconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo’burg! I gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get there, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting time. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building. The door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter.",0
"” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were never traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die down, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. The trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and beauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to make of it a cause célèbre. People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm.",0
"""Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look. “You told me to get Cabin 17.” There is a touch of the “boy upon the burning deck” about Pagett. “My dear fellow,” I said testily, “I mentioned No. 17 because I happened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn’t mean you to make a stand to the death about it 13 or 28 would have done us equally well.” He looked hurt. “There’s something more, though,” he insisted.",0
"… She had loved him! Could she let her hand be the one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but she was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her. However that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day. Madame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was acquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau was never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her. Taking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life. I have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here.",0
"He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite.",0
"But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?” She crossed herself. “Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?” “Do I know me? A man a stranger. They found him up there in the shed not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed stabbed to the heart with the same dagger!” Waiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me. Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, c’est l’Anglais! Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was neatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an expensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on his left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up, black and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning! “I’m expecting the doctor any minute,” explained Giraud. “Although we hardly need him. There’s no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed to the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.” “When was it done? Last night?” Giraud shook his head. “Hardly. I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well ” I felt flustered. “I I assumed it.” “Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, mon petit does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here and here ” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have been careful to obliterate them but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?” “Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable. Also, by this ” And, leaning forward, he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see. It was a woman’s long black hair similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. Eh bien, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud. “They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look. “On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?” “Very curious,” I agreed. “And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.” He looked down at the body again. “As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wore gloves.” “You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. “Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared at the doorway. “Monsieur?” “Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago?” “She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.” “Good. I only want one at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared again. A moment later he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld. “Here is Madame.” Giraud came forward with a curt bow. “This way, madame.” He led her across, and then, standing suddenly aside. “Here is the man. Do you know him?” And as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to read her mind, noting every indication of her manner. But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm too calm, I felt. She looked down at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life. He is quite a stranger to me.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure.” “You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?” “No,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea.",0
"Pagett had brought a sixth child into the world the other day. England will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the child a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness to act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post card straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face! Bless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you have made in not marrying me. Yours ever, Eustace Pedler. Harry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not see eye to eye. To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder me and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend. Sir Eustace’s attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are not in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had a genuinely kindly feeling towards me. Then why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says “because he’s a damned scoundrel,” and seems to think that settles the matter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her, and she put it down to a “fear complex.” Suzanne goes in rather for psycho-analysis. She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace’s whole life was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had an acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina removed certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the state of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute fears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina, she was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of questionable things in order to get rich, but women shouldn’t pretend to be in love when they aren’t for ulterior motives. I can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive Nadina. Never, never, never! The other day I was unpacking some tins that were wrapped in bits of an old Daily Budget, and I suddenly came upon the words, “The Man in the Brown Suit.” How long ago it seemed! I had, of course, severed my connection with the Daily Budget long ago I had done with it sooner than it had done with me. My Romantic Wedding was given a halo of publicity. My son is lying in the sun, kicking his legs. There’s a “man in a brown suit” if you like. He’s wearing as little as possible, which is the best costume for Africa, and is as brown as a berry. He’s always burrowing in the earth. I think he takes after Papa. He’ll have that same mania for Pleiocene clay. Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.” Strangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion. Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess! It was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective, Hercule Poirot. The Calais express was singularly empty in fact, my own compartment held only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace. “Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an imaginary audience. “I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but Oh, Lord, there’s reason enough for it! Do you know I’ve lost my only sister?” “Really?” I said politely. “How unfortunate.” “He disapproves!” remarked the lady. “He disapproves utterly of me, and my sister which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!” I opened my mouth, but she forestalled me. “Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo! I am crushed!” She buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter. “I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried. Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I most disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was decidedly pretty.… “There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx. “Say you’re sorry about my sister ” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.",0
"I regard myself as a consulting specialist.” Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand or rather tell me where to lay my hand on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.” Poirot considered. “Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now the facts.” “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual.",0
"""Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted. “I shouldn’t dream of marrying any one unless I was madly in love with them. And of course there is really nothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn’t like for the sake of some one she does like. And the more self-willed she is, the more she likes it.” “I’m afraid I disagree with you. The boot is on the other leg as a rule.” He spoke with a slight sneer. “Exactly,” I cried eagerly. “And that’s why there are so many unhappy marriages. It’s all the fault of the men. Either they give way to their women and then the women despise them, or else they are utterly selfish, insist on their own way and never say ‘thank you.’ Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want, and then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it. Women like to be mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated. On the other hand, men don’t really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most of the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects it, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be!” Harry laughed outright. “What a cat and dog life you will lead.” “Lovers always fight,” I assured him. “Because they don’t understand each other. And by the time they do understand each other they aren’t in love any more.” “Does the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always lovers?” “I I don’t know,” I said, momentarily confused. He turned away to the fireplace. “Like some more soup?” he asked in a casual tone. “Yes, please. I’m so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.” “That’s good.” He busied himself with the fire; I watched. “When I can get off the couch, I’ll cook for you,” I promised. “I don’t suppose you know anything about cooking.” “I can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,” I retorted, pointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece. “Touché,” he said, and laughed. His whole face changed when he laughed. It became boyish, happy a different personality. I enjoyed my soup. As I ate it I reminded him that he had not, after all, tendered me his advice. “Ah, yes, what I was going to say was this. If I were you I would stay quietly perdu here until you are quite strong again. Your enemies will believe you dead. They will hardly be surprised at not finding the body. It would have been dashed to pieces on the rocks and carried down with the torrent.” I shivered. “Once you are completely restored to health, you can journey quietly on to Beira and get a boat to take you back to England.” “That would be very tame,” I objected scornfully. “There speaks a foolish schoolgirl.” “I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.",0
"4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is really a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of Pagett’s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn’t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived by Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch. He never worried me or got in my way. Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us can move without falling over it. I went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my appearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were listening spellbound to one of Race’s travellers’ tales.",0
"No, Anne, don’t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down here. Joking apart, I think you’ve made a very important discovery. Up till now, we’ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we know he hasn’t.” “Exactly,” I said. “We must keep an eye on him.” “As well as everybody else,” she said ruefully. “Well, that’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. That and finance. No, don’t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you’ve got to listen to horse sense over this.",0
"Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along. Hence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected. My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in another moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He beamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced me warmly on the platform. “Mon cher ami, I have succeeded but succeeded to a marvel!” “Indeed? I’m delighted to hear it.",0
"There was only one diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, celui-là! “But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled. “For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.” “Lady Yardly?” “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance.",0
"Just at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would not have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. With a short laugh he released me. “What’s your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet. “What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her.” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. I could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. For he must have loved her once he must he must to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck. I think it was a “witch”!  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Mount Nelson Hotel,  Cape Town. It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden. The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing. According to him, you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to my interests. His story was extraordinarily vague and rambling, and it was a long time before I could make head or tail of it. To begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving suspiciously. Those are Pagett’s words. He has taken them straight from the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn’t know himself. I said so to him. “He was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the middle of the night, Sir Eustace.” “Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren’t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?” I demanded irritably. “I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.” Trust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it! “Well?” “I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir Eustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I thought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked about him. He slunk up the stairs by the saloon. I followed him. “My dear Pagett,” I said, “why shouldn’t the poor chap go on deck without having his footsteps dogged? Lots of people even sleep on deck very uncomfortable, I’ve always thought. The sailors wash you down with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.” I shuddered at the idea. “Anyway,” I continued, “if you went worrying some poor devil who was suffering from insomnia, I don’t wonder he landed you one.” Pagett looked patient. “If you would hear me out, Sir Eustace. I was convinced the man had been prowling about near your cabin where he had no business to be. The only two cabins down that passage are yours and Colonel Race’s.” “Race,” I said, lighting a cigar carefully, “can look after himself without your assistance, Pagett.” I added as an afterthought: “So can I.” Pagett came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before imparting a secret. “You see, Sir Eustace, I fancied and now indeed I am sure it was Rayburn.” “Rayburn?” “Yes, Sir Eustace.” I shook my head. “Rayburn has far too much sense to attempt to wake me up in the middle of the night.” “Quite so, Sir Eustace. I think it was Colonel Race he went to see. A secret meeting for orders!” “Don’t hiss at me, Pagett,” I said, drawing back a little, “and do control your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. “Something was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.",0
"Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest.",0
"""Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?” The man looked up at him and started. “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours. The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.” “What about the jewel-case?” I asked. “It was found in a corridor of the hotel.",0
"""But why?” “Parbleu! so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you.” “What?” “Mais, oui to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was dissatisfied. It was not strong enough!” He paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement: “And so, mon ami, since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible.” “Merlinville,” I murmured thoughtfully. “I’ve heard of it, I think.” Poirot nodded.",0
"Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room must have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn up, and scattered on the floor. This morning ” But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell. Françoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove of course! What else? With a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her.",0
"Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could not know beforehand that Mr. Davenheim would be absent posting a letter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!” “He might have seized his opportunity,” I suggested. “And the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s tools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with a penknife, bien entendu!” “Well, what about Number Two?” “You say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better of it is more likely to be the other way about. Whatever grudge there might have been would have been on Mr. Davenheim’s side.” “Well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the study?” “No. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man’s clothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual, he would have done better to speak the truth.” “And the fourth point?” “I grant you that. If Kellett’s story is true, Lowen is undeniably implicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.” “Then I did appreciate one vital fact?” “Perhaps but you have entirely overlooked the two most important points, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter.” “And pray, what are they?” “One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last autumn.” “Poirot, you are joking!” “I am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not forget my little commission.” But the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about eleven o’clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read it out: “‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’” “Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!” I stared at him. “You have no moneys in the bank of Davenheim and Salmon, mon ami?” “No,” I said, wondering. “Why?” “Because I should advise you to withdraw it before it is too late.” “Why, what do you expect?” “I expect a big smash in a few days perhaps sooner. Which reminds me, we will return the compliment of a dépêche to Japp. A pencil, I pray you, and a form. Voilà! ‘Advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question.’ That will intrigue him, the good Japp! His eyes will open wide wide! He will not comprehend in the slightest until to-morrow, or the next day!” I remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend’s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank.",0
"In the meantime the fighting goes on.” “I wish,” I said, “that one could be sure that the right people were the ones to get killed. I mean the ones who wanted to fight not just all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the fighting is going on.” He nodded. “I know what you mean, Anne. That’s the unfairness of war. But I’ve other news for you.” “Yes?” “A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to escape.” “What?” “Yes. No one knows how he managed it.",0
"Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating. “I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took the path to the bridge. I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge.",0
"I will rejoin you later.” It was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I understood everything understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last my own heart.… “Yes,” I said gently. “Is he looking for me?” she half whispered. Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big chair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping. I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair back from her face. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know I know everything.” “Oh, but you don’t!” “I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked: “It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action. “Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused. “Go on what next?” “I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links ” Again I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused. “You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely. “And you love me? Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which way to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!” Again I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could. “Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it and the wonder, I shall not forget no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “Mon ami,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “Mon Dieu! no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! Eh bien, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.” “There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! Eh bien! it comes to this are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well I warned you. When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “Mon ami! Vive l’amour! It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!” After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned. Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being. But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act but I could not rest easy in my mind. Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what your plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.” “But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France without delay.” “We?” “Precisely ‘we!’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish ” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard which every one would perceive, bien entendu I much prefer that we should voyage together. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you ” “I know I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient.",0
"I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed.",0
"The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all. What do you think, M. le docteur?” “I can only say that it is most abnormal.” “It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed after he was dead.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M. Giraud agrees with me, do you not, monsieur?” Whatever Giraud’s real belief, he accepted the position without moving a muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied: “Certainly I agree.” The murmur of surprise and interest broke out again. “But what an idea!” cried M. Hautet. “To stab a man after he is dead! Barbaric! Unheard of! Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.” “No, M. le juge,” said Poirot. “I should fancy it was done quite cold-bloodedly to create an impression.” “What impression?” “The impression it nearly did create,” returned Poirot oracularly. M. Bex had been thinking. “How, then, was the man killed?” “He was not killed. He died. He died, M. le juge, if I am not much mistaken, of an epileptic fit!” This statement of Poirot’s again aroused considerable excitement. Dr. Durand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. At last he rose to his feet. “Well, M. le docteur?” “M. Poirot, I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your assertion. I was misled to begin with. The incontrovertible fact that the man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other indications.” Poirot was the hero of the hour. The examining magistrate was profuse in compliments. Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself on the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he wished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave the shed, Giraud approached us. “One more thing, M. Poirot,” he said, in his suave mocking voice. “We found this coiled round the handle of the dagger. A woman’s hair.” “Ah!” said Poirot. “A woman’s hair? What woman’s, I wonder?” “I wonder also,” said Giraud. Then, with a bow, he left us. “He was insistent, the good Giraud,” said Poirot thoughtfully, as we walked towards the hotel. “I wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me? A woman’s hair h’m!” We lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris. “Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find this.” He took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the reproduction of a woman’s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an exclamation. “You recognize it, my friend?” I nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back, and the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was unmistakable. “Madame Daubreuil!” I exclaimed. Poirot shook his head with a smile. “Not quite correct, my friend. She did not call herself by that name in those days.",0
"” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.",0
"After our recent conversation, he gave ‘Dinner’ to my ‘Tuesday,’ but ‘Journey’ and ‘Country’ were answered by ‘Ship’ and ‘Uganda,’ showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here. ‘Story’ recalls to him one of the ‘Lion’ stories he told at dinner. I proceed to ‘Rook Rifle’ and he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘Farm.’ When I say ‘Shot,’ he answers at once ‘Suicide.’ The association seems clear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere.",0
"“Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well er I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence. I turned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an interest in his story. “Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me. I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists.",0
"” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he but what do men care if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.",0
"I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I sprang up. Harry was on the stoep outside. “Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.” I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing.",0
"When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense” “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly.",0
"“Why?” “Monsieur has not heard the news, though?” “What news?” “That there has been another murder there last night!” “What?” Leaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could. Another murder and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise. “What has happened?” “Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?” She crossed herself.",0
"” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight. Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head the “Colonel” was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival.",0
"She had never liked her a bold, red-faced thing a born thief. She had said from the first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on her it would be very surprising! Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, Célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily. “If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie!” she declared heatedly. “I never so much as saw them.” “Search her!” screamed the other. “You will find it is as I say.” “You’re a liar do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon her. “Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again. I’d be glad if the police would search me. I’ve nothing to be afraid of.” At this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to it. His face brightened when he saw who it was. “Ah!” he said. “That’s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our female searchers, and she’s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldn’t mind going into the room next door.” He looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head, the searcher following her closely. The French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking round the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a sketch. [A sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor.] “Where does that door lead?” he inquired, nodding his head towards the one by the window. “Into the next apartment, I believe,” said the inspector. “It’s bolted, anyway, on this side.” Poirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and tried it again. “And on the other side as well,” he remarked. “Well, that seems to rule out that.” He walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn. “And again nothing. Not even a balcony outside.” “Even if there were,” said the inspector impatiently, “I don’t see how that would help us, if the maid never left the room.” “Évidemment,” said Poirot, not disconcerted. “As Mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room” He was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher. “Nothing,” said the latter laconically. “I should hope not, indeed,” said the chambermaid virtuously. “And that French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girl’s character!” “There, there, my girl; that’s all right,” said the inspector, opening the door. “Nobody suspects you. You go along and get on with your work.” The chambermaid went unwillingly. “Going to search her?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine. “Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key. Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her. The inspector’s face grew graver. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room.” Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully. “Si, si, mon enfant I assure you it is better not to resist.” Then he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little experiment purely for my own satisfaction.” “Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally. Poirot addressed Célestine once more. “You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it?” “On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.” “And the scissors?” “They also.” “Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?” Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned. Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand. “Again, if you please, mademoiselle.” At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket. “Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,” he bowed to the inspector “for your courtesy.” The inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness. Célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Then, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to work to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards, completely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked on sceptically. “You really think you will find them?” “Yes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadn’t time to take them out of the room. The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans.",0
"At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot: “Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.” Dumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath. “He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something in it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don’t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up right away, and take another look at her.” But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind.",0
"… “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before. If it was not Bella Duveen, the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one single proof against her! “And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea since, as she thought, it belonged to her sister.",0
"By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow. We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed. Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty. “Sacré!” cried Poirot angrily. “Some one has been before us.” We examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment of what we sought. A portion of Baker’s signature remained, but no indication of what the terms of the will had been. Poirot sat back on his heels. His expression would have been comical if we had not been so overcome. “I understand it not,” he growled. “Who destroyed this? And what was their object?” “The Bakers?” I suggested. “Pourquoi? Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit yes; but one cannot suspect institutions.” “Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,” I suggested. Poirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care. “That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.” By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal. “Vite, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!” Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention. “Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again will I vaunt my little grey cells!” “That’s a good job at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this all about?” As usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely no attention to me. “The tradesmen’s books I have left them entirely out of account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at once.” Easier said than done.",0
"He seems to regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand, regard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful. “We’ll get an extra cabin,” I said hastily. The thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?” “The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,” replied Pagett seriously. “But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there’s something very queer about that cabin.” Memories of reading The Upper Berth floated through my mind.",0
"Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.",0
"“There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated.",0
"Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself! I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise. “A la bonne heure, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.” “You are called away on a case, then?” “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr.",0
"""Had he any reason to believe that you and I might be friendly with each other?” “He might have had,” I answered thoughtfully, remembering our conversation on the way back from the Matoppos. “He’s a very powerful personality,” I continued, “but not at all my idea of the ‘Colonel.’ And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He’s in the Secret Service.” “How do we know that he is? It’s the easiest thing in the world to throw out a hint of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the rumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you like Race?” “I do and I don’t.",0
"Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.",0
"But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement.",0
"Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband’s financial débâcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that the young soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that was last night!’ she observes.",0
"“Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station.” “Oh, no, thank you,” I said hastily. “Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered.” To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!” “What has he done now?” I inquired with some curiosity. “He’s got hold of a secretary for me.",0
"” Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: “I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.” We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I thought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as ever, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor.",0
"In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “Ma foi! but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.",0
"However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. “Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld. They both addressed Colonel Race. “I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?” I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time. Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so on. Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject.",0
"“Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress.",0
"He was thoroughly taken aback. What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room. Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others. “Mother!” “Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what brings you here? You were to sail on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others, she turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet, acknowledging the young man’s bow. “So you did not sail on the Anzora?” “No, monsieur. As I was about to explain, the Anzora was detained twenty-four hours through engine trouble. I should have sailed last night instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening paper, I saw in it an account of the the awful tragedy that had befallen us ” His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. “My poor father my poor, poor, father.” Staring at him like one in a dream, Mrs. Renauld repeated: “So you did not sail?” And then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured as though to herself, “After all, it does not matter now.” “Sit down, M. Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah. And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark Anzora sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.",0
"I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive.",0
"""Yes?” “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.” “And the chauffeur?” “The chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.” “So,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the Prime Minister in France, and O’Murphy in London.",0
"“I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,” I said coldly. “I can at least relieve you of my presence.” He started for the door, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed him down upon the sofa. “Don’t be a fool,” I said unceremoniously. “You don’t want to go bleeding all over the ship, do you?” He seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as best I could. “There,” I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, “that will have to do for the present.",0
"The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind. Was it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was prejudiced the Tube incident was my own pet mystery but there certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the two fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face evidently an Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me to what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland Yard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of the Mill House case.",0
"When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.",0
"He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?” His eyes challenged us. “But I Hercule Poirot tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within here!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within.",0
"Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the result. The minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return. “Curious,” I remarked, at length. “I wonder when they will come back.” Poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said thoughtfully: “They will not come back.” “Why?” “Because, my friend, something has happened.” “What sort of thing? How do you know?” I asked curiously. Poirot smiled. “A few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs. He was much agitated.",0
"” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this.",0
"How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much. What kept her there the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas en route to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the Anzora had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I could not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to him, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do. Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London was uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, mon ami. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day.",0
"Foscatini sits down, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind Graves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to the service telephone dinner for three! It comes, he lays the table, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to get rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a resolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos, the rice soufflé is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion.",0
"Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle_ that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the devil Carton hid them if he did hide them, I don’t know.” “That’s another story,” I quoted. “My story. And I’m going to tell it you now.” Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been in my possession or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in her own brain, and the “Colonel” was not likely to guess that they had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward! Harry’s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured. It was the other, graver charge that paralyzed all our activities. For, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove his case. The one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity of the “Colonel.” Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett? “I should say he was but for one thing,” said Harry. “It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Grünberg at Marlow and that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s business was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate. No the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt to put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town by no possible means could he have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town. He might, of course, have cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who could have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of that note being written.” We sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: “You say that Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you heard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew? Where was Colonel Race?” “I could not find him anywhere.” “Had he any reason to believe that you and I might be friendly with each other?” “He might have had,” I answered thoughtfully, remembering our conversation on the way back from the Matoppos. “He’s a very powerful personality,” I continued, “but not at all my idea of the ‘Colonel.’ And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He’s in the Secret Service.” “How do we know that he is? It’s the easiest thing in the world to throw out a hint of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the rumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you like Race?” “I do and I don’t. He repels me and at the same time fascinates me; but I know one thing, I’m always a little afraid of him.” “He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley robbery,” said Harry slowly. “But it was he who told Suzanne all about the ‘Colonel’ and how he had been in Paris trying to get on his track.” “Camouflage_ of a particularly clever kind.” “But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race’s pay?” “Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, “he doesn’t come in at all.” “What?” “Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s own account of that night on the Kilmorden?” “Yes through Sir Eustace.” I repeated it. Harry listened closely. “He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks him down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and find Pagett lying there. How’s that?” “You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.” “Well, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me disappearing in the distance? Wouldn’t he take it for granted that I was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I he was following?” “It’s possible, yes,” I said slowly. “But it alters all our ideas. And there are other things.” “Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man might have merely asked him the time.” “It was just a coincidence, you mean?” “Not exactly. There’s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with the affair. Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen? Would he have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so providentially upon the scene?” “Then you think he may be entirely innocent?” “It looks like it, but, if so, we’ve got to find out what he was doing in Marlow.",0
"on January 22nd on the outward journey. A lady would be occupying the cabin, and the affair was described as a bet. I gathered that the steward had been liberally paid for his part in the transaction. The lady’s name had not been mentioned. Of course, as Mrs. Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing the purser as soon as she got on board, it never occurred to the steward that she was not the lady in question. The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the Kilmorden seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr. Pagett from their position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind. I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary. I was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. “I have always longed to go to Italy,” I said. “And especially to Florence. Didn’t you enjoy it very much there?” “Indeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld. If you will excuse me, there is some correspondence of Sir Eustace’s that” I took hold of him firmly by his coat sleeve. “Oh, you mustn’t run away!” I cried with the skittish accent of an elderly dowager. “I’m sure Sir Eustace wouldn’t like you to leave me alone with no one to talk to. You never seem to want to talk about Florence. Oh, Mr. Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!” I still had my hand on his arm, and I could feel the sudden start he gave. “Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables” “Oh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed.",0
"Even to Pagett. I happened to hear that he or rather Mrs. Pagett had brought a sixth child into the world the other day. England will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the child a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness to act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post card straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face! Bless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you have made in not marrying me. Yours ever, Eustace Pedler. Harry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not see eye to eye.",0
"Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot so and I say: the Prime Minister is there! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.” And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener.",0
"What drama is this being played? Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her? Or are they the scoundrels, and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?” “The great detective, mon ami, chooses, as ever, the simplest course. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at the window. In a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle. “As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism. That is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, en passant, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!” I laughed.",0
"""Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.” He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside. “Eh bien, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?” I did not reply. Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going.",0
"I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps.",0
"Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back.",0
"Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah.",0
"” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.",0
"The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.” “But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every one!” “He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.” “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?” “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.” “And the real Prime Minister?” “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs. Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity. “When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” “When I began to work the right way from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a mind like mine!” The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran: “In time.” Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression. Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly. “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us. “To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.” I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp. “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.” Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply: “Be exact, my friend. What do you mean by ‘disappear’? To which class of disappearance are you referring?” “Are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” I laughed. Japp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both. “But certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First, and most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much abused ‘loss of memory’ case rare, but occasionally genuine. Third, murder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you refer to all three as impossible of execution?” “Very nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory, but some one would be sure to recognize you especially in the case of a well-known man like Davenheim. Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up against civilization.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you make one error. You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man or with himself in a figurative sense might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.” “But not you, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at me. “He couldn’t baffle you, eh, Monsieur Poirot?” Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest. “Me, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with an exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only too rare in the new generation of detectives!” Japp grinned more widely. “I don’t know,” he said. “Miller, the man who’s on this case, is a smart chap.",0
"“Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly 10th viscount, served South African War’ tout ça n’a pas d’importance ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ um, um, um, ‘has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. Clubs residences.’ Voilà, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this milord!” “What?” “Yes. I telegraphed to him.” “I thought you had washed your hands of the case?” “I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.",0
"No, I swore to myself that I’d take better care of you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this island. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come and look after you.

How some words please one! “You did quite right,” I said quietly. “And I shall not send word to any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn’t make much difference. It’s not as though they were my own people.",0
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr.",0
"""There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! Eh bien! it comes to this are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him.",0
"“The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.” “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver. “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch.",0
"Il l’a emportée simplement! Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate, but she still breathed.” Poirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could. Suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack. “Ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried. “What is it?” “This piece of toast. You remark him not?” He whipped the offender out of the rack, and held it up for me to examine. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we here? None.” “It’s cut from a cottage loaf,” I explained soothingly.",0
"Well, I must wish you good night, Monsieur Poirot, unless” He hesitated. “I perceive the thought in your mind,” said Poirot, smiling. “I shall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get hold of a taxi.” Taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon bowling along in the direction of Regent’s Park. Regent’s Court was a new block of flats, situated just off St. John’s Wood Road. They had only recently been built, and contained the latest service devices. There was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell impatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply. “Flat II.",0
"Part of me was appalled at the sudden disaster, and another part of me was coolly and dispassionately interested in the methods employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back onto the platform. “Let me pass, please. I am a medical man.” A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the motionless body. As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me. The thing wasn’t real couldn’t be. Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head. “Dead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.” We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice.",0
"I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out. “Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the affair at the Villa Geneviève?’ “Yes,” I said eagerly.",0
"Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?” “Oh!” I said, bewildered. “Exactly,” said Poirot, beaming. “We start again.” He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience.",0
"He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa. The House of Commons is bad enough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight restriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly before leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman with a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle in Alice in Wonderland. He dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy fashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further efforts by ejaculating something that sounded like “Platt Skeet,” uttered fortissimo and in marked contrast to the rest of his delivery. When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa. I have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at last the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins me to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by his master’s side. And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences too! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders. This morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was urbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he alluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that I should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria. “You expect trouble, then?” I asked. His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far. “There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble. There is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives have been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents which throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import them. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean ‘detonators,’ cauliflower, ‘rifles,’ other vegetables stand for various explosives.” “That’s very interesting,” I commended. “More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that the man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the affair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.” He stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me of being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the thought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of inspecting a miniature revolution at first hand. “No trains are running from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he continued. “But I can arrange to send you over by private car. In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me I know what happens in a case of that kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters of law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms. Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there God knows how long. They’ve blown up the railway line already, I hear. It isn’t even as if one could get a drink there. They put the place under martial law two days ago. “My dear fellow,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that I’m studying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study them from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don’t you worry about me. I shall be all right.” “I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already serious.” “A little fasting will improve my figure,” I said, with a sigh. We were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it with amazement: “Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.” I don’t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne. There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young woman she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She has an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don’t see why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the middle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no train, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel’s wings and flown there. And I don’t suppose she will ever explain. Nobody does to me. I always have to guess. It becomes monotonous after a while. The exigencies of journalism are at the bottom of it, I suppose. “How I shot the rapids,” by our Special Correspondent. I refolded the telegram and got rid of my Governmental friend.",0
"“What terrible voice? Who is it, and what’s the trouble?” “It was the telephone, doctor. I answered it and a voice spoke. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor help. They’ve killed me!’ Then it sort of tailed away. ‘Who’s speaking?’ I said. ‘Who’s speaking?’ Then I got a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘Foscatine’ something like that ‘Regent’s Court.’” The doctor uttered an exclamation. “Count Foscatini. He has a flat in Regent’s Court. I must go at once. What can have happened?” “A patient of yours?” asked Poirot. “I attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian, but he speaks English perfectly.",0
"When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense” “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly. “I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.” I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest. “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.” “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?” “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.” “And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her. For my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject as we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest. “But yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not underrate the force of superstition.” “What are we going to do about it?” “Toujours pratique, the good Hastings! Eh bien, to begin with we are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr. Bleibner’s death.” He duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young Rupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead. A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime. The news of his uncle’s death reaches him. He realizes how unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes his own life. I outlined my solution to Poirot. He was interested. “It is ingenious what you have thought of there decidedly it is ingenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the fatal influence of the Tomb.” I shrugged my shoulders. “You still think that has something to do with it?” “So much so, mon ami, that we start for Egypt to-morrow.” “What?” I cried, astonished. “I have said it.” An expression of conscious heroism spread over Poirot’s face. Then he groaned. “But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!” It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids. The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me.",0
"It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But ” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the ” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “Mille tonnerres!” cried Poirot.",0
"le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “Eh bien! I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice.",0
"“Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does ” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother. The magistrate understood. “As yet no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?” “I have no idea whatsoever.” M. Hautet sighed. “A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis.",0
"Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment I had a two-berth one to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the train would start. But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well.",0
"Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert. “A wonderful place,” I said aloud, “and a wonderful work. I can feel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel the charm?” I got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was quickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude couch, his face horribly convulsed.",0
"The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I thought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as ever, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor. The detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion. “You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about the case. Let’s hear your views.” “One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M. Giraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there nothing it reminds you of?” “Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so, though.” “You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember but I shall do so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or less.” “There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate say a case of burglary can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.” “And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue a psychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “Eh bien, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the salon door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?” The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.” “Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain Hastings.” Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. “Sent for you, did he?” “You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?” interposed M. Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about. He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities. Your name?” “Gabriel Stonor.” “How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?” “About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met him through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering good boss he was too.” “Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?” “Yes, a good bit.” “Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?” “Several times, I believe.” “He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him?” “Never.” “Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there?” “No.” “Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?” “Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there was a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.” “So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.” The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor the case is like this. There must be no reservations. You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might enfin!” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs. Renauld come in? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very wonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations, or otherwise, could affect her?” “Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that you’re wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have further proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the adjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never looked at a petticoat!” The secretary’s eyes narrowed. “Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul Renauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s some other explanation.” The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “What other explanation could there be?” “What leads you to think it was a love affair?” “Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! mon Dieu! What else could it be?” “Blackmail,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor. “The old man was being bled and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet. “Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it. What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M. Renauld?” “Over a year?” “Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?” “I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.” “In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?” “Absolutely.” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face. He was thoroughly taken aback. What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room. Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others.",0
"By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle, which left Cape Town in two days’ time. I had just time to journey down and catch the same boat. “I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board.",0
"“What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But another voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I will inform you, if you like, M. le juge.” “You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this attachment, madame.” “I feared it,” she replied simply. “Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is beautiful. What can you have against her?” “I have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should prefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who has a mother of doubtful antecedents!” Her rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I could well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when her only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her rival. Mrs. Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate: “I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I hoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death ” Poirot interrupted with a quick question. “You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?” “I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad. “Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate. “After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly realized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last. Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective. Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so. “Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does ” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother. The magistrate understood. “As yet no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?” “I have no idea whatsoever.” M. Hautet sighed. “A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis. “And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M.",0
"She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs” “But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected. “I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!” “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity.",0
"“More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that the man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the affair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.” He stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me of being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the thought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of inspecting a miniature revolution at first hand. “No trains are running from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he continued. “But I can arrange to send you over by private car.",0
"To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera. All Carton’s effects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his state of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind. That was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why should he be carrying a roll of films? I set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be developed. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of each film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my roll.",0
"“In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!” He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a how do you call it? ‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.” I laughed.",0
"As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to note down?” “The letter to you?” “That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning of the case.",0
"My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to the lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite window.",0
"Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the Kilmorden_ either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right.",0
"Having parted with mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the interview had taken place in a house in St. John’s Wood) and across Hyde Park to St. George’s Hospital. There I entered Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road. Once on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring mind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really were points and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased to find I was right.",0
"I can’t help feeling responsible for his death. It will haunt me for ever!” “No, no,” I said soothingly. “Of course it’s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,” resumed Jack, “but I’d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and realized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so honestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself.",0
"Then, his face lightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the dead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was but how did you know?” “By this. I found it on the back of the leather chair.",0
"“What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M.",0
"When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after me! I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since. He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.",0
"Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.",0
"I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this time!) I murmured: “Kilmorden Castle?” “On the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?” “How much is it?” “First class, eighty-seven pounds” I interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly the amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket. “First class,” I said. I was now definitely committed to the adventure.  (Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.) It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace. I am a man who likes a quiet life.",0
"“But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced.",0
"“Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.” “Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?” “Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.",0
"“Miss Beddingfeld got the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.” I looked at him severely. “If you’re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who is a missionary though a perfectly poisonous person and that attractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don’t believe a word of it,” I said coldly. “Anne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl with particularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.” Pagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld’s legs.",0
"You may laugh if you like, but I’m not going to be this blasted old Men-her-Ra’s next victim. He’ll get me if I stop here.” The young man wiped the perspiration from his brow. Poirot turned away. Over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile: “Remember, he got one of his victims in New York.” “Oh, hell!” said Mr. Harper forcibly. “That young man is nervous,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “He is on the edge, but absolutely on the edge.” I glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me nothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were taken round the excavations.",0
"“It is really insupportable,” he murmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!” “Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars that is, if you know!” “Eh bien, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!” “Do you know where he is hiding?” “Certainly! It is most ingenious.",0
"“Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty.",0
"My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county. He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter. “Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these ‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted on that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’ “That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died. “I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death ‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.” “That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.” “I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.” “Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?” “No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.” “There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?” “I would not even attempt to do such a thing.” “You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle?” “That is exactly how I look upon it.” “It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.” “Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?” “Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.” “Have you the will or a copy of it with you?” Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it, nodding to himself. “Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also 11 a.m. that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made even half-an-hour later would upset this. Eh bien, mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!” (Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!) “Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?” “Yes, their name is Baker.” The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant couple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin, and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm. Tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s constant resting-place.",0
"""Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position.",0
"“I don’t know.” “In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am not dead yet!’ To which you responded: ‘I wish you were!’” The boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him. “I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply. With an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor. “What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with my father. I dare say I said all those things I was so angry I cannot even remember what I said! I was furious I could almost have killed him at that moment there, make the most of that!” He leant back in his chair, flushed and defiant.",0
"An event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure. The more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the British Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh zest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue. A fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York.",0
"“What do you say, monsieur?” For a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted across his face. “My friends, if I were hiding from the police, do you know where I should hide? In a prison!” “What?” “You are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison, so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there!” “What do you mean?” “You tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman. Nevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and confronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him! In spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. A woman nearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may be deceived!” “Billy Kellett? But he’s known to the police!” “Did I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his alibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn he was creating the character of Billy Kellett, ‘doing three months,’ so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came. He was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty. It was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. Only” “Yes?” “Eh bien, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to make up as himself again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right. He went to the boathouse, donned his ‘tramp’ clothes, which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped the others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a policeman, getting himself safely into the haven of Bow Street, where nobody would ever dream of looking for him!” “It’s impossible,” murmured Japp. “Ask Madame,” said my friend, smiling. The next day a registered letter lay beside Poirot’s plate. He opened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friend’s brow puckered. “Ah, sacré! But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse! Ce pauvre Japp! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we three! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I, who would not rob a child mille tonnerres! Mon ami, what have you, that you laugh so heartily?” Poirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near neighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. It was the genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer. The doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree, admired the talents so far removed from his own.",0
"” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion.",0
"Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee. The young of the human race show some anthropoid features, whereas the young of the chimpanzee approach more nearly to the human than the adult chimpanzee does. That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were more Simian than we are, the chimpanzee’s were of a higher type than the present species in other words, the chimpanzee is a degenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the Daily Budget, being hard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with large headlines. “We are not descended from monkeys, but are monkeys descended from us? Eminent Professor says chimpanzees are decadent humans.” Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the moment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question. I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the Daily Budget. However, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely put on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer. The reporter from the Daily Budget was the only young man who ever came to our house. There were times when I envied Emily, our little servant, who “walked out” whenever occasion offered with a large sailor to whom she was affianced. In between times, to “keep her hand in” as she expressed it, she walked out with the greengrocer’s young man, and the chemist’s assistant. I reflected sadly that I had no one to “keep my hand in” with. All Papa’s friends were aged Professors usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a “neat little waist” and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a “neat little waist” since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always “felled their opponent with a single blow.” There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could “fell” an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela.” Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair.",0
"“She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter.",0
"But in real life there was absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said that morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it going to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale.",0
"""Impossible!” “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.",0
"“What says the master detective, eh?” asked Hawker, clapping him on the back. “Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.” “You think not?” “What could there be?” “Well, for example, there is the window.” “The window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in that way. I noticed it specially.” “And why were you able to notice it?” The doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain. “It is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd, that. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.” “Well, what of it?” “Very black,” repeated Poirot.",0
"“By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife wicked little thing! that Jack had given Bella! Ten to one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress. “I told you that I was staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but of course really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again. “Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God’s earth. I told her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing… laughing… laughing… it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once. “And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night… I was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her. So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.” “But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me. “What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the hand. Young Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated before starting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor accompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan looks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “Eh ma foi! and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle. “You would have had Maître Grosíer’s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on.” “He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he worried me horribly. You see, I couldn’t very well take him into my confidence. But, my God! what’s going to happen about Bella?” “If I were you,” said Poirot frankly, “I should not distress myself unduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the crime passionnel. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you ” “I don’t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I do feel guilty of my father’s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this girl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat. I can’t help feeling responsible for his death.",0
"January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?” “Exactly.” She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. “You said just now that none of us had anything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have had the wit and, yes, the courage for it needs courage to double-cross him. You remember the De Beer diamonds?” “Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I had nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case was hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.” “A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked it under the ‘Colonel’s’ orders, of course. And it was then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time. Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.” “Very clever,” interpolated the Count approvingly. “The ‘Colonel’ is always clever. Well, I did my part but I also did one thing which the ‘Colonel’ had not foreseen. I kept back some of the South American stones one or two are unique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beer’s hands. With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter is bound to be suspected. I have said nothing all these years, I have been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but now matters are different. I want my price and it will be a big, I might almost say a staggering price.” “Extraordinary,” said the Count. “And doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you everywhere?” His eyes roamed gently round the disordered room. Nadina laughed softly. “You need suppose nothing of the sort. I am not a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will dream of looking for them.” “I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The ‘Colonel’ is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.” “I am not afraid of him,” she laughed. “There is only one man I have ever feared and he is dead.” The man looked at her curiously. “Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,” he remarked lightly. “What do you mean?” cried the dancer sharply. The Count looked slightly surprised. “I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,” he explained. “A foolish joke.” She gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war. He was a man who once loved me.” “In South Africa?” asked the Count negligently. “Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.” “That is your native country, is it not?” She nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. “Well,” he remarked, “you know your own business best, but, if I were you, I should fear the ‘Colonel’ far more than any disillusioned lover. He is a man whom it is particularly easy to underestimate.” She laughed scornfully. “As if I did not know him after all these years!” “I wonder if you do?” he said softly. “I very much wonder if you do.” “Oh, I am not a fool! And I am not alone in this. The South African mail-boat docks at Southampton to-morrow, and on board her is a man who has come specially from Africa at my request and who has carried out certain orders of mine. The ‘Colonel’ will have not one of us to deal with, but two.” “Is that wise?” “It is necessary.” “You are sure of this man?” A rather peculiar smile played over the dancer’s face. “I am quite sure of him. He is inefficient, but perfectly trustworthy.” She paused, and then added in an indifferent tone of voice: “As a matter of fact, he happens to be my husband.” Everybody has been at me, right and left, to write this story from the great (represented by Lord Nasby) to the small (represented by our late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in England. “Lor’, miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all just like the pictures!”). I’ll admit that I’ve certain qualifications for the task. I was mixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick of it all through, and I was triumphantly “in at the death.” Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler’s diary, of which he has kindly begged me to make use. So here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures. I’d always longed for adventures. You see, my life had such a dreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England’s greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really was a genius every one admits that. His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic times, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body inhabited the modern world. Papa did not care for modern man even Neolithic Man he despised as a mere herder of cattle, and he did not rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period. Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men. One is forced to have some kind of truck with butchers and bakers and milkmen and greengrocers. Therefore, Papa being immersed in the past, Mamma having died when I was a baby, it fell to me to undertake the practical side of living. Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and revised most of Papa’s Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors, Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote ages.",0
"To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder me and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend. Sir Eustace’s attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are not in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had a genuinely kindly feeling towards me. Then why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says “because he’s a damned scoundrel,” and seems to think that settles the matter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her, and she put it down to a “fear complex.” Suzanne goes in rather for psycho-analysis.",0
"Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn. “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate very delicate.” “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.” He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. “My dear Pedler! The common post!” It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’ Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents.",0
"""It must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like you.” “Well, I’m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and goes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking.",0
"In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him.",0
"""What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.",0
"The Riviera was all right, of course, because one met all one’s friends there. I listened and contained myself with difficulty. Most of these women were rich. The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to wander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London and talked about milkmen and servants! I think now, looking back, that I was perhaps a shade intolerant. But they were stupid stupid even at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily inadequate and muddled housekeeping accounts. My affairs did not progress very fast.",0
"His accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now, for, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have been cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.” “Perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?” “Then why did he not do so? He merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing more. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the truth.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the clock, “I suppose we’d better start for the station.",0
"I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married even to Clarence!” I disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all.",0
"""Good Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I’d give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself just for once. You’re so confoundedly conceited!” “Do not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there are times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties of greatness!” The little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that I was forced to laugh. Tuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicions or certainties.",0
"Nevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the English papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details. Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole matter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance. The remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot’s point of view struck me at once. “Poirot,” I said, “I congratulate you.",0
"“I thought I thought it was the master it looked like ’im.” I saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it too, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirot’s arm with a scream. “Didn’t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? That’s how he always used to tap when he passed round the house.” “The ivy,” I cried. “It was the ivy against the pane.” But a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was obviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers besought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be left alone. We sat in the little morning-room.",0
"We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. Ça vous dit quelque chose? I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini’s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?” I shook my head, utterly bewildered. “Come, I will help you.",0
"A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace.",0
"I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he’s come back!” Her voice died away in a gurgle. “Lights,” said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic. “That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window. A bad night but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.” “You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did not observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see nothing!” “Well, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black’s story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally ingenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter view. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered. “No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.” “Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said. “Let us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband’s financial débâcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that the young soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that was last night!’ she observes. ‘Could a man shoot himself in such a way? Do show me if it is possible!’ The poor fool he shows her. He places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and puts her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. ‘And now, sir,’ she says saucily, ‘supposing I pull the trigger?’ “And then and then, Hastings she pulls it!”  So far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot’s investigations have started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case.",0
"A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.",0
"“Now, what about Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that evening?” “Well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen is a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been able once or twice to score a coup off Davenheim in the market, though it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter concerning some South American shares which led the banker to make his appointment.” “Had Davenheim interests in South America, then?” “I believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in Buenos Ayres.",0
"In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have £50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams.",0
"Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could.",0
"My maid remains in the room till I come up, so there’s no need.” The inspector’s face grew graver. “Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then the maid has not left the room?” Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French.",0
"Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together.",0
"You say no one else was near enough to see what happened?” “I had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can’t be sure and, anyway, they wouldn’t be as near as I was.” The inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure. The deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been found in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel.",0
"There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race and his people. You didn’t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race.",0
"One must seek the truth within not without.” “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?” “That is exactly what I do mean granted the facts were placed before me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.” Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand or rather tell me where to lay my hand on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.” Poirot considered. “Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now the facts.” “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After tea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added that he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come before he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door, passed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and was never seen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.” “Pretty very pretty altogether a charming little problem,” murmured Poirot. “Proceed, my good friend.” “About a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick black moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he had an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen, and in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into the study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return. Finally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable to wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed unaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor. Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure. “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.",0
"“What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her.” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. I could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. For he must have loved her once he must he must to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck. I think it was a “witch”!  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Mount Nelson Hotel,  Cape Town. It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden. The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing. According to him, you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to my interests. His story was extraordinarily vague and rambling, and it was a long time before I could make head or tail of it. To begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving suspiciously. Those are Pagett’s words. He has taken them straight from the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn’t know himself.",0
"And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said: “But certainly. Ask them to enter.” In another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil. She was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue.",0
"“But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules Poirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case.",0
"Before me, on the rough wooden table, is the letter that Suzanne wrote me. Dear Babes in the Wood Dear Lunatics in Love, I’m not surprised not at all. All the time we’ve been talking Paris and frocks I felt that it wasn’t a bit real that you’d vanish into the blue some day to be married over the tongs in the good old gipsy fashion. But you are a couple of lunatics! This idea of renouncing a vast fortune is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to argue the matter, but I have persuaded him to leave the argument to time. He can administer the estate for Harry and none better.",0
"” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s me Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it.",0
"The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed to die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully I crept down the stairs.",0
"Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him. His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do. I don’t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise. There’s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you’re a sensible young woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him” “I won’t do anything of the kind.” “Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl. You’ll have to trust me and hope for the best. Of course, if you’re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that’s another matter.” This was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace’s dictation: Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any possible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to Agrasato’s curio-shop. Ask to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” The man will then ask you to “come into the back room.” Go with him. You will find a messenger who will bring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the diamonds with you. Not a word to any one. Sir Eustace stopped. “I leave the fancy touches to your own imagination,” he remarked. “But be careful to make no mistakes.” “‘Yours for ever and ever, Anne,’ will be sufficient,” I remarked. I wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through. “That seems all right. Now the address.” I gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a consideration. He struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew, alias Minks, answered the summons. “This letter is to go immediately the usual route.” “Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room.",0
"“You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?” “I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad. “Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate. “After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly realized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last.",0
"There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls! This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness.",0
"How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully.",0
"” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was omniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.",0
"Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M.",0
"What did you mean by that?” The two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said: “You have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied Conference?” My friend nodded. “For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow Thursday evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity.",0
"Well, what is it?” “When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece of paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead man. The doctor didn’t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some figures.” “Let’s see it.” Lord Nasby stretched out a careless hand. “I think not,” I said, smiling. “It’s my find, you see.” “I’m right. You are a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it. No scruples about not handing it over to the police?” “I went there to do so this morning.",0
"“I make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless Célestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room in the morning while Célestine is present, and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise she never enters the room.” “Well, as I was saying,” continued Mrs. Opalsen, “I came up. I went to the drawer here,” she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table “took out my jewel-case and unlocked it. It seemed quite as usual but the pearls were not there!” The inspector had been busy with his notebook. “When had you last seen them?” he asked.",0
"“All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study. “You think so? Eh bien, I agree with you,” said Poirot. He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “Mon Dieu! But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, mon ami. At last I am on the right track. I am still in the dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did not confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak, don’t we?” I admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language. I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind. “There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated. But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged.",0
"What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.",0
"""Comment?” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things.",0
"At last he called me: “Come, Anne, it’s time to go.” I got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I knew that dawn was not far off. “We’ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat” Harry began, when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand. “Hush! What’s that?” I listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the wilderness. Presently I heard it too the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.",0
"Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something that satisfied my aching hunger for romance. Perfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the Kilmorden glided nearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all dreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans are so anxious not to miss anything. “This is South Africa,” I kept saying to myself industriously, “South Africa, South Africa. You are seeing the world. This is the world. You are seeing it. Think of it, Anne Beddingfeld, you pudding-head. You’re seeing the world.",0
"“Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur Poirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair?” “Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man arrived?” “It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?” “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.” “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.” “What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station.",0
"” He looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair. “I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.” “And to-day?” “To-day I do not know what to think.” Poirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again. “I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.” “Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard.",0
"M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil the dagger! Jack Renauld had three souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans.",0
"I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton.",0
"You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons would be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made.",0
"Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence, and admitted that the “Russians” were a pure invention on her part. The real murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had committed the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had consented also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime.",0
"She can typewrite, I know, for she told me so.” To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not like Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he has displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries nowadays. Just to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has extremely nice legs.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I don’t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first sight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out on deck.",0
"Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.” I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure.",0
"Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw. I had always vaguely associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong that is a lava-lava. At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I can’t help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of bacon-bacon, and then go out clad in a jumper-jumper to pay the books. Suzanne was a little tamer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a lovely view right out over Table Bay. I looked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some special face-cream. When she had found it and started an immediate application, she became capable of listening to me. “Did you see Sir Eustace?” I asked. “He was marching out of the breakfast room as we went in. He’d had some bad fish or something and was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and he bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was only it wasn’t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.” Suzanne smiled. “Sir Eustace doesn’t like getting up early any more than I do. But, Anne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage. He’s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?” “Only trying to push me overboard,” I replied nonchalantly. It was a distinct score for me. Suzanne left her face half anointed and pressed for details. I gave them to her. “It all gets more and more mysterious,” she cried. “I thought I was going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that you would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but now I’m not so sure. I hope Pagett won’t push me off the train some dark night.” “I think you’re still above suspicion, Suzanne. But, if the worst happens, I’ll wire to Clarence.” “That reminds me give me a cable form. Let me see now, what shall I say. ‘Implicated in the most thrilling mystery please send me a thousand pounds at once Suzanne.’” I took the form from her, and pointed out that she could eliminate a “the,” an “a,” and possibly, if she didn’t care about being polite, a “please.” Suzanne, however, appears to be perfectly reckless in money matters. Instead of attending to my economical suggestions, she added three words more: “enjoying myself hugely.” Suzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the hotel about eleven o’clock to fetch her. I was left to my own devices. I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the tram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying the sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream sodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the hotel. To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from the curator of the Museum. He had read of my arrival on the Kilmorden, in which I was described as the daughter of the late Professor Beddingfeld. He had known my father slightly and had had a great admiration for him. He went on to say that his wife would be delighted if I would come out and have tea with them that afternoon at their Villa at Muizenberg. He gave me instructions for getting there. It was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and highly thought of. I foresaw that I would have to be personally escorted round the Museum before I left Cape Town, but I risked that. To most people it would have been a treat but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a nice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on. The people had short curved boards and came floating in on the waves. It was far too early to go to tea. I made for the bathing pavilion, and when they said would I have a surf board, I said “Yes, please.” Surfing looks perfectly easy. It isn’t. I say no more. I got very angry and fairly hurled my plank from me. Nevertheless, I determined to return on the first possible opportunity and have another go. I would not be beaten. Quite by mistake I then got a good run on my board, and came out delirious with happiness. Surfing is like that. You are either vigorously cursing or else you are idiotically pleased with yourself. I found the Villa Medgee after some little difficulty. It was right up on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages and villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. “Mrs. Raffini?” I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me. A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. “So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said. He was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange beard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself.",0
"The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable.",0
"He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir larger.",0
"""I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely it. Too much so perhaps. Was he or was he not just a little like a stage clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly.",0
"It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House.",0
"Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester.",0
"Hautet and say that we will come at once.” Poirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But when he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. “He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly. We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M.",0
"“Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay.",0
"Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.” “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.” “What?” “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.” He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending. He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass.",0
"A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern. “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.",0
"Renauld’s youth and upbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?” “All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.” “What is it, my friend?” “Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!” “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot placidly, “that is just what he did do!” In a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition.",0
"“You have a little idea, I see, mon ami! Capital. We progress.” I sat up, and lit a pipe. “Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say we although I dare say I would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.” “And who is that?” inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes. “Georges Conneau!” The next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. “Enfin! You have arrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning. You are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.",0
"She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that it is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand, Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could. All this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne’s full approval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a psychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards).",0
"It took an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long heart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I succeeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out. Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall. I looked round me and then caught my breath with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said. I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. “All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?” It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it. “All bluff. They haven’t an idea where she is.” “She spoke very positively.” “I dare say. I’ve looked into the matter, and we’ve nothing to fear. Anyway, it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ orders. You don’t want to go against them, I suppose?” The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it to be a hasty disclaimer. “But why not knock her on the head?” he growled. “It would be simple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?” “Yes,” said Chichester meditatively. “That is what I should do. She knows too much, that is certain. But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.” He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. “Information?” “Something of the kind.” “Diamonds,” I said to myself. “And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.” For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables. Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting. “Good,” said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. “I will take these with me for the ‘Colonel’ to see.” “When do you leave?” “Ten o’clock to-morrow morning will do.” “Do you want to see the girl before you go?” “No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the ‘Colonel’ comes. Is she all right?” “I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I think. What about food?” “A little starvation will do no harm. The ‘Colonel’ will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely tied up?” The Dutchman laughed. “What do you think?” They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I beat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time the Kafir stirred and moved. My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing.",0
"By the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no sign of my quarry. I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it. It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: "". 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any importance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure.",0
"I hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he negatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners he was sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he could not have failed to observe them. I do not know what put the idea into my head possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones but I asked suddenly: “Young M. Renauld he did not leave by that train, did he?” “Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour, it would not be amusing, that!” I stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me. Then I saw.… “You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening?” “But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the 11:40.” My brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant anxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime. Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along. Hence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected. My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in another moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He beamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced me warmly on the platform. “Mon cher ami, I have succeeded but succeeded to a marvel!” “Indeed? I’m delighted to hear it. Have you heard the latest here?” “How would you that I should hear anything? There have been some developments, eh? The brave Giraud, he has made an arrest? Or even arrests perhaps? Ah, but I will make him look foolish, that one! But where are you taking me, my friend? Do we not go to the hotel? It is necessary that I attend to my moustaches they are deplorably limp from the heat of travelling. Also, without doubt, there is dust on my coat. And my tie, that I must rearrange.” I cut short his remonstrances. “My dear Poirot never mind all that. We must go to the Villa at once. There has been another murder!” I have frequently been disappointed when fancying that I was giving news of importance to my friend. Either he has known it already or he has dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue and in the latter case events have usually proved him justified. But this time I could not complain of missing my effect. Never have I seen a man so flabbergasted. His jaw dropped. All the jauntiness went out of his bearing. He stared at me open-mouthed. “What is that you say? Another murder? Ah, then, I am all wrong. I have failed. Giraud may mock himself at me he will have reason!” “You did not expect it, then?” “I? Not the least in the world. It demolishes my theory it ruins everything it ah, no!” He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest. “It is impossible. I cannot be wrong! The facts, taken methodically and in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I must be right! I am right!” “But then ” He interrupted me. “Wait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is impossible unless unless oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word ” He was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he said in a quiet assured voice: “The victim is a man of middle-age. His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily in the back.” It was my turn to gape and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a doubt crossed my mind. “Poirot,” I cried, “you’re pulling my leg. You’ve heard all about it already.” He turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully. “Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing whatsoever. Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?” “But how on earth could you know all that?” “I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the little grey cells! They told me. Thus, and in no other way, could there have been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. Poirot listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons would be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again.",0
"“Look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to London?” “You think so, Hastings? Why?” “Well” I coughed delicately “things haven’t gone very well, have they? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose!” “True,” said Poirot, rather crestfallen. “It was not one of my most striking triumphs.” This way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I stuck to my guns.",0
"It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never read the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all did, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.",0
"The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. “23rd May. M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. “24th May. M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “7th June. Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter written to M.",0
"To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered. “No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.” “Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said. “Let us start from the beginning.",0
"If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order.",0
"He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself it’s something about the eyes.” “I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.",0
"Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.",0
"er Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely. “Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once I offer it again. Will you have it?” The fierceness of his answer took me aback. “No. I’ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise. “Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in my power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press ever so little. “Like this and squeeze the life out of you! And then like our unconscious friend here, but with more success fling your dead body to the sharks. What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real. Just at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would not have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. With a short laugh he released me. “What’s your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet. “What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her.” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. I could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. For he must have loved her once he must he must to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck. I think it was a “witch”!  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Mount Nelson Hotel,  Cape Town. It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden. The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing. According to him, you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to my interests. His story was extraordinarily vague and rambling, and it was a long time before I could make head or tail of it. To begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving suspiciously. Those are Pagett’s words. He has taken them straight from the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn’t know himself. I said so to him. “He was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the middle of the night, Sir Eustace.” “Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren’t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?” I demanded irritably. “I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.” Trust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it! “Well?” “I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir Eustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I thought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked about him. He slunk up the stairs by the saloon. I followed him. “My dear Pagett,” I said, “why shouldn’t the poor chap go on deck without having his footsteps dogged? Lots of people even sleep on deck very uncomfortable, I’ve always thought. The sailors wash you down with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.” I shuddered at the idea. “Anyway,” I continued, “if you went worrying some poor devil who was suffering from insomnia, I don’t wonder he landed you one.” Pagett looked patient. “If you would hear me out, Sir Eustace. I was convinced the man had been prowling about near your cabin where he had no business to be. The only two cabins down that passage are yours and Colonel Race’s.” “Race,” I said, lighting a cigar carefully, “can look after himself without your assistance, Pagett.” I added as an afterthought: “So can I.” Pagett came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before imparting a secret. “You see, Sir Eustace, I fancied and now indeed I am sure it was Rayburn.” “Rayburn?” “Yes, Sir Eustace.” I shook my head. “Rayburn has far too much sense to attempt to wake me up in the middle of the night.” “Quite so, Sir Eustace. I think it was Colonel Race he went to see. A secret meeting for orders!” “Don’t hiss at me, Pagett,” I said, drawing back a little, “and do control your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. “Something was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.” “You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only part of the story that he wasn’t vague about. “There’s something very queer about all this,” he said. “To begin with, where is Rayburn?” It’s perfectly true that we haven’t seen the fellow since we came on shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however. Altogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter. I can’t take him about with me in his present condition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray’s billet-doux, but I shall not take Pagett with me. Confound the fellow and his prowling ways. Altogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast with poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of getting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired. Later. A very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray’s sealed letter. It didn’t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper! Now, I suppose, I’m in the devil of a mess. Why I ever let that bleating old fool Milray embroil me in the matter I can’t think. Pagett is a famous Job’s comforter. He displays a certain gloomy satisfaction that maddens me. Also, he has taken advantage of my perturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk. Unless he is careful, the next funeral he attends will be his own. However, in the end I had to listen to him. “Supposing, Sir Eustace, that Rayburn had overheard a word or two of your conversation with Mr. Milray in the street? Remember, you had no written authority from Mr. Milray. You accepted Rayburn on his own valuation.” “You think Rayburn is a crook, then?” I said slowly. Pagett did. How far his views were influenced by resentment over his black eye I don’t know. He made out a pretty fair case against Rayburn. And the appearance of the latter told against him. My idea was to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact. But Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was all for vigorous measures. He had his way of course. He bustled out to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a herd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies and sodas at my expense. We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned. You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. Later. Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot. You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” “I shall manage,” I said airily. “Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o’clock train to-morrow, Wednesday, morning,” Pagett continued. “I have made all arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned. “I must have been very drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed. Take my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you, don’t go on the bust again.” “As you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.” “Much wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I haven’t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I said thoughtfully. “She wants to get to Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I’ve a good mind to offer her a temporary job as a secretary. She can typewrite, I know, for she told me so.” To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not like Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he has displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries nowadays. Just to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has extremely nice legs.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I don’t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first sight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out on deck. I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight. It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that’s extra beautiful. I’m not very good at expressing these things, but I knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment, the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsly. Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something that satisfied my aching hunger for romance. Perfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the Kilmorden glided nearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all dreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans are so anxious not to miss anything. “This is South Africa,” I kept saying to myself industriously, “South Africa, South Africa. You are seeing the world. This is the world. You are seeing it. Think of it, Anne Beddingfeld, you pudding-head. You’re seeing the world.” I had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed another figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in the rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew who it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic in the peaceful morning sunlight. What must he have thought of me? It made me hot to realize the things that I had said.",0
"Us had signed one” “What time of day was that?” Baker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker. “Why, to be sure, I’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven. Don’t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen.” “And afterwards?” “’Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. ‘I’ve made a mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. I’ll trouble you to sign again,’ and us did. And afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each.",0
"""You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile.",0
"Witnessed by the two servants, Denise and Françoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it back. “Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice ” “The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago. Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his amorous intrigues.” “Yes,” said M.",0
"It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M.",0
"""Would it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our visitor’s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.” Roger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart appearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently labouring under great agitation. “Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s partner, I understand. It is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.” “I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is ill in bed influenza.” His face fell. “Dear me, that is a great blow to me.",0
"Since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him. “You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella. Every moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon as he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression that the assassins left that way. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two years ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall upon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same story as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the mind against originality. The night is chilly, and he slips on an overcoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave with the dead man. He goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower bed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence against himself. He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he digs and then ” “Yes?” “And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.… Now, Hastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of two crimes. The first crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to investigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged Hercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to solve that will be difficult since the criminal in his wisdom, has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by M. Renauld. It has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young hand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology, is almost certain to fail.” “You’re marvellous, Poirot,” I said, with admiration. “Absolutely marvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!” I think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost embarrassed. “Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound?” His term for Giraud never failed to make me smile. “Rather. You’ve scored over him handsomely.” “That poor Giraud,” said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest. “Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had la mauvaise chance once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for instance. To say the least, it was misleading.” “To tell you the truth, Poirot,” I said slowly, “even now I don’t quite see whose hair was it?” “Madame Renauld’s of course. That is where la mauvaise chance came in. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered. It might just as easily have been a grey hair and then, by no conceivable effort could Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack Renauld! But it is all of a piece. Always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man and a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case? I will tell you it does not fit in, and so we shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of working? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy balloon swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he despises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon comme ça!” And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he resumed: “Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak. The possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the Anzora? Ah! voilà une femme, Hastings! What force, what self-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: ‘It does not matter now.’ And no one noticed no one realized the significance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play, poor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and, instead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now. No wonder she fainted! But since then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has played her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son’s sake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the criminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s past life. ‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was perfect, the indulgent tone, the soupçon of sad mockery. At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great woman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!” Poirot lost himself in contemplation. “One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?” “You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be unrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track. And that imbecile of a Giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends! Did I not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a clue of two inches?” “Well, Giraud will sing small now,” I observed hastily, to lead the conversation away from my own shortcomings. “As I said before, will he? If he has arrived at the right person by the wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.” “But surely ” I paused as I saw the new trend of things. “You see, Hastings, we must now start again. Who killed M. Renauld? Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night, some one who would benefit by his death the description fits Jack Renauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point.",0
"A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown” was returned, and the police (and the Daily Budget_) were left to look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out.",0
"“They were there when I went down to dinner.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case.” “Who locked up the jewel-case?” “I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.” She held it up as she spoke. The inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders. “The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the jewel-case?” “I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.” “You didn’t lock the drawer?” “No, I never do.",0
"""Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.” “He was supposed to be in Florence but he certainly never went there. I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved.",0
"""He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal.",0
"“When shall we start?” “The hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing is likely to occur before then.” At twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot’s manipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed into the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar. “Now we have but to wait,” said Poirot contentedly, closing his eyes. To me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to sleep.",0
"He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he digs and then ” “Yes?” “And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him.
