"There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.",0
"""I have reappeared again,” I told him solemnly. “And how are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Very well, thank you looking forward to taking up my work again with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I said, “there is something I want to ask you. I hope that you won’t be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you can possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow on the 8th of January last?” He started violently. “Really, Miss Beddingfeld I indeed” “You were there, weren’t you?” “I for reasons of my own I was in the neighbourhood, yes.” “Won’t you tell me what those reasons were?” “Sir Eustace has not already told you?” “Sir Eustace? Does he know?” “I am almost sure that he does.",0
"But who was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?” “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.” “Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each other.",0
"He seems to regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand, regard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful. “We’ll get an extra cabin,” I said hastily. The thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?” “The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,” replied Pagett seriously. “But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there’s something very queer about that cabin.” Memories of reading The Upper Berth floated through my mind.",0
"I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and said: “Come out at once, please,” in an acid voice. There was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He did not move. “Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What am I to do?” Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor. Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough. He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade a nasty deep wound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it.",0
"""About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are but I’ve got another roll.",0
"Renauld. It has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young hand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology, is almost certain to fail.” “You’re marvellous, Poirot,” I said, with admiration. “Absolutely marvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!” I think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost embarrassed. “Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound?” His term for Giraud never failed to make me smile. “Rather.",0
"“I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race.",0
"The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans. No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” “More than unlikely impossible!” said Poirot quietly. “Eh?” The inspector stared. Poirot smiled modestly. “I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.",0
"What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there.",0
"I twisted a dagger from his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes, whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man nodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive followed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were out in the street, Poirot turned to me. “There is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the revolver.",0
"You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured.",0
"He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!” I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head.",0
"” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening. The show was wearisome beyond words or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so.",0
"The possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the Anzora? Ah! voilà une femme, Hastings! What force, what self-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: ‘It does not matter now.’ And no one noticed no one realized the significance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play, poor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and, instead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now.",0
"We parted on that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’ “That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died. “I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will.",0
"Harper was saying, “I’ve only been six months with the expedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner’s affairs pretty well.” “Can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?” “He turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I’d never met him before, but some of the others had Ames, I think, and Schneider. The old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. They were at it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘Not a cent,’ the old man shouted. ‘Not one cent now or when I’m dead. I intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my life’s work. I’ve been talking it over with Mr.",0
"We closed the door and Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The boat was just about to run alongside it. “Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice. Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.",0
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr.",0
"“We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.” “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.” Miss Marvell nodded. “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.",0
"“He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly. “You know me?” Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures.",0
"Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief “Bien, j’y serai” he rang off, and turned to me. “What do you think, mon ami?” He looked half ashamed, half excited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.” “What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?” “This morning, I understand.” I shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me. You see I was right.",0
"I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery.",0
"“But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!” It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids. The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot.",0
"But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement.",0
"In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the papers.” “Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked.",0
"If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!” “Do not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are not so easily parted. Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out a tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.” I acknowledged the wisdom of this. “In any case,” continued Poirot, “it is not the money which attracts me here. Certainly it will be pleasant to have carte blanche in our investigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest. You remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?” I considered.",0
"I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin.",0
"So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld.",0
"""Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.",0
"Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure. “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew.",0
"“M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you.",0
"Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.",0
"“Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see” He paused delicately. “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head. The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us. “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?” She shook her head.",0
"But in real life there was absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said that morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it going to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale.",0
"‘I’ve left you nothing in my will,’ says he, ‘but each year I live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg when I’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.” Poirot reflected. “After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do you know?” “Went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.” That did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He held out the key of the desk. “Is that your master’s writing?” I may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed before Baker replied: “Yes, sir, it is.",0
"It must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room. “Oh, doctor, you’re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a turn, it did indeed.” I recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker’s housekeeper, Miss Rider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence.",0
"""What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.",0
"” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you ” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed.",0
"On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck. I think it was a “witch”!  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Mount Nelson Hotel,  Cape Town. It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden.",0
"The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably deeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and here the words that he used are significant.” “‘Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now,’” I repeated. “They seem to me a little vehement, perhaps, that is all.” “That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why? Not only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.” “Why should it be?” I asked, bewildered. “That is what we ask ourselves.",0
"I’ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways, Monsieur Poirot and I’m head over ears in debt but I want to pull up. I’m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten things up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf is offering me big money enough to set me on my feet again. I don’t want to do it I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the Chase but I may have to, unless” He broke off. Poirot eyed him keenly.",0
"Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate: “I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I hoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback.",0
"She was middle-aged, and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call “une maitresse femme.” She greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head. “Pray be seated, monsieurs.” We took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a round table. “I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night?” “Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly assassins are to be caught and punished.",0
"” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind ” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?” “Well, I’d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he’s anywhere about, and see what he’s up to.” “The human foxhound,” murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a comfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “By all means, my friend. Au revoir.” I strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the path we had taken the day before.",0
"Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the Kilmorden_ either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right.",0
"I realized that as we went up the stairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming greeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the “good wife and mother” type. She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices. I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. “Well, Henry, why on earth” I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident.",0
"Had he been pumping me? Were those slight inaccuracies just tests to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) There is something to be said for life on board ship. It is peaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar.",0
"A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said.",0
"” Afraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out to do his master’s errand. This evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent matters politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When Graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off. “Was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?” asked the inspector. “No, sir; it wasn’t.",0
"Then, when I had told him kindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking about some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge at Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort. I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter. I thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because the typewriter was sure to have gone wrong it always does and he would have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten Pagett’s powers of being in the right. “I’ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace.",0
"Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious “Colonel.” Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was steaming out to sea.",0
"The black silk handbag which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose change, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of a first-class ticket to London. Nothing much there to go upon. Such were the details published broadcast by the Daily Budget, and “Find the Man in the Brown Suit” was their daily war-cry. On an average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their success in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces cursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown suit.",0
"Ah, this cursed sand!” “Come, now, there’s a lot of sand in Belgium,” I reminded him, mindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “les dunes impeccables” as the guide-book had phrased it. “Not in Brussels,” declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids thoughtfully. “It is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid and geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they plant them in rows!” I cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start for the camp.",0
"It was the genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer. The doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree, admired the talents so far removed from his own. On one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes.",0
"The hall was empty. Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to a garage. I went in. “I have met with an accident,” I explained. “I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.” I had not long to wait.",0
"” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this.",0
"I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue.",0
"I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again.",0
"Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.",0
"I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance. Finally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no such place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There must be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find.",0
"Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the mirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag. “That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.",0
"“It’s quite a common name.” “Ah! Sapristi, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and her husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New York, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the Camorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their track. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler? They offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of young couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be several Robinsons.",0
"It was already a few minutes past the dinner hour. Suddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed in the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress. Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there with one hand just touching the necklace. “Behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to have vanished. “Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.” The switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened.",0
"I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face. I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board.",0
"“I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.” I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest. “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.” “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?” “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science.",0
"If O’Murphy is an honest man, why did he leave the main road? But if he was a dishonest man, why did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired thereby, in all probability, saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, again, if he was honest, why did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a well-known rendezvous of German spies?” “It looks bad,” I said. “Let us look at the case with method. What have we for and against these two men? Take O’Murphy first.",0
"Il l’a emportée simplement! Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate, but she still breathed.” Poirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could. Suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack. “Ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried. “What is it?” “This piece of toast. You remark him not?” He whipped the offender out of the rack, and held it up for me to examine. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we here? None.” “It’s cut from a cottage loaf,” I explained soothingly.",0
"What drama is this being played? Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her? Or are they the scoundrels, and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?” “The great detective, mon ami, chooses, as ever, the simplest course. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at the window. In a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle. “As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism. That is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, en passant, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!” I laughed.",0
"But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, mon ami, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air.",0
"It seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded at the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted a policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street with Miller and saw him. He’s sober enough now, and I don’t mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting he might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer one it is. “He was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins was his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a bad day, and was down on his luck.",0
"It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters was sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon. Having heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his appeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate which, of course, it did. “They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M.",0
"He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table.",0
"But she is the kind of young woman who does these things. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into my private car! I am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He might just have got off by Monday’s train. They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that says little. He’s an astute young man and he knows Africa. He’s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman and the simple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a scar, dressed in the height of European fashion.",0
"“Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress.",0
"“You have a little idea, I see, mon ami! Capital. We progress.” I sat up, and lit a pipe. “Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say we although I dare say I would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.” “And who is that?” inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes. “Georges Conneau!” The next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. “Enfin! You have arrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning. You are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.",0
"""Well, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me disappearing in the distance? Wouldn’t he take it for granted that I was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I he was following?” “It’s possible, yes,” I said slowly. “But it alters all our ideas. And there are other things.” “Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man might have merely asked him the time.” “It was just a coincidence, you mean?” “Not exactly. There’s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with the affair.",0
"“It looks like hair,” I remarked distastefully. “It is hair. I think it’s what they call a toupee.” “Indeed,” I commented. “Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in disguise?” “Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by her feet.” “Then that’s that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you about my private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have found me out.” At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be revealed! “Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,” I said kindly.",0
"Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard. You wouldn’t like me to come with you, would you?” “I should love it.” “Nice girl. Sure you won’t change your mind and come and look for lions in Rhodesia?” “Quite sure.” “He must be a very handsome fellow,” said Sir Eustace plaintively.",0
"Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.” I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure.",0
"She presented an extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr. Opalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials stood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An hotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the fire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman, obviously Mrs. Opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands, with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress. Into this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling.",0
"I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.” He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind.",0
"""Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position.",0
"It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But ” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the ” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “Mille tonnerres!” cried Poirot.",0
"She can typewrite, I know, for she told me so.” To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not like Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he has displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries nowadays. Just to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has extremely nice legs.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I don’t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first sight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out on deck.",0
"They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.” “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.” “You mean they were false?” “Yes, madame. But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart.",0
"’ He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed.",0
"All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full, stood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar, the other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding cigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table. I enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I wondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked him. “Mon ami,” he replied, “you miss the point. I am looking for something that I do not see.",0
"I’ve met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her, and should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn ass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her. He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work.",0
"""By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road, “I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.” Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me. “And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired. Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster.",0
"Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream. “My God!” cried Lord Yardly. “That was Maude’s voice! What has happened?” We rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the darkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight met our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck. As we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive, her eyelids opened.",0
"Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.” “Yes?” I said, much interested. “There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last the day before yesterday the body of Mr.",0
"We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn’t her game. Sometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn’t been, for Sir Laurence Eardsley’s only son was quite a parti. But the truth of it was that she was married to a sorter in De Beers’ though nobody knew of it.",0
"But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.",0
"""Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl. You’ll have to trust me and hope for the best. Of course, if you’re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that’s another matter.",0
"” Poirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady Yardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game. “Vous êtes bonne mère,” said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse. Lady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair. “I adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice. “And they you with reason!” Poirot bowed again. A dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms.",0
"However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need.",0
"” Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully. “Si, si, mon enfant I assure you it is better not to resist.” Then he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little experiment purely for my own satisfaction.” “Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally. Poirot addressed Célestine once more. “You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it?” “On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.” “And the scissors?” “They also.",0
"What do you think I found?” I shook my head. “This!” Pagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap. “What should a woman want with these?” I don’t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the high-class ladies’ papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew’s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly behind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even Pagett has his limits. “You’re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to this?” I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly.",0
"""But who which was he?” “The man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who has not been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the country enfin, that ‘stodgy’ old man, Mr. Shaw! There are criminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are. Mademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?” And, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek! I have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.",0
"“The old man was being bled and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet.",0
"Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what your plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.” “But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France without delay.” “We?” “Precisely ‘we!’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish ” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight.",0
"Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there God knows how long. They’ve blown up the railway line already, I hear. It isn’t even as if one could get a drink there. They put the place under martial law two days ago. “My dear fellow,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that I’m studying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study them from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don’t you worry about me. I shall be all right.",0
"When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened desperately. “They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said. But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said.",0
"On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job but it was a mistake on their part.",0
"They’re only acquaintances really even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must have known a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.” I managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all. “If you would be guided by me” he said, hesitating. “I don’t expect I shall be,” I answered candidly. “But there’s no harm in hearing.” “Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted.",0
"” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight. Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head the “Colonel” was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival.",0
"""Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did.",0
"In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. “Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.” “Are you sure you’re all right now?” “Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.",0
"I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly.",0
"She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness. “Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen’s room.” The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife’s room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered. As she was about to depart Poirot detained her. “One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen a card like this?” He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully. “No, sir, I can’t say I have.",0
"Maltravers,” said Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing further” We took the hint. “Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?” “Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.” And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces. “And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor. “Rather an old ass.” “Exactly.",0
"Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so.",0
"Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.",0
"Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free but in order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation. And then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was.",0
"But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.",0
"“Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.",0
"“And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from you to your mother. Very sad very distressing ” Jack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M.",0
"A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories.",0
"""But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow.",0
"” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he but what do men care if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.",0
"” And the Minister strode rapidly away. We chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre of the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little ferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old acquaintance of Poirot’s Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be one of the smartest of Scotland Yard’s officers. He came over and greeted my friend cheerfully. “I heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far they’ve got away with the goods all right. But I can’t believe they can keep him hidden long.",0
"We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. Ça vous dit quelque chose? I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini’s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?” I shook my head, utterly bewildered. “Come, I will help you.",0
"Since it was to Jack Renauld’s advantage that the body should be found without delay, why dig a grave at all?” Giraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance. Poirot moved towards the door. I followed him. “There is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,” he said over his shoulder. “What is that?” “The piece of lead piping,” said Poirot, and left the room. Jack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we came out of the salon, he looked up sharply. At the same moment there was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was descending it.",0
"He was inclined to resent our appearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland Yard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation. This was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The story he had to tell was a sensational one. On the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his master.",0
"""And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course.",0
"The lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times, but he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are distrait; and to make a waiter distrait” Poirot shook his head with an air of finality. “The affair must indeed be of the first magnitude. Ah, it is as I thought! Here come the police.” Two men had just entered the hotel one in uniform, the other in plain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered upstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting. “Mr.",0
"Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly.",0
"I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. Eh bien, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’ I had heard, or read, all these things before.",0
"""Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?” “Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’” “Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head in and withdrawing it immediately. I stood up. “And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked demurely. Harry came close to me. “My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring his neck. And as for you” “Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited. “I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!” “What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically.",0
"We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds. Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke. “I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.” The girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall. “Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.” But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle.",0
"At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up. “Keep still, please,” I said. He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a little. “Thank you, I don’t need anything done for me.” His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks of even common gratitude! “That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” He flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour of him. My temper, never placid, rose.",0
"Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.",0
"He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me.",0
"""Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, petite, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound.",0
"""I do not see that you can fix that definitely unless you question Mademoiselle Dabreuil again.” “There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see nothing, Hastings!” I looked at him for a moment. “Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being in the other’s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.” A faint smile crossed Poirot’s lips.",0
"“Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?” “Do I know me? A man a stranger. They found him up there in the shed not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed stabbed to the heart with the same dagger!” Waiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me.",0
"A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern. “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.",0
"He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” “And they have found nothing else?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.",0
"Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.",0
"I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there. I had nearly reached the place when ” He paused and swallowed. “Yes?” “I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud a sort of choke and gasp but it frightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came round the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then and then I looked up and saw her.",0
"I regard myself as a consulting specialist.” Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand or rather tell me where to lay my hand on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.” Poirot considered. “Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now the facts.” “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual.",0
"""Sacré tonnerre!” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack.",0
"Always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man and a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case? I will tell you it does not fit in, and so we shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of working? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy balloon swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he despises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon comme ça!” And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he resumed: “Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak.",0
"“Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well er I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence.",0
"As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.",0
"“It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.",0
"“You permit, madame?” He took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her with a little bow. “A magnificent stone without a flaw. Ah, cent tonnerres! and you carry it about with you, comme ça!” “No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it’s locked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit. We’re staying at the Magnificent, you know. I just brought it along to-day for you to see.” “And you will leave it with me, n’est-ce pas? You will be advised by Papa Poirot?” “Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot.",0
"I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved.",0
"She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her.",0
"“Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly 10th viscount, served South African War’ tout ça n’a pas d’importance ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ um, um, um, ‘has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. Clubs residences.’ Voilà, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this milord!” “What?” “Yes. I telegraphed to him.” “I thought you had washed your hands of the case?” “I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.",0
"Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil. Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs. I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction.",0
"Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you need have no fear for yourself” I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face “you are not threatened. Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr. Milray wishes me to accompany you.",0
"""What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference.",0
"Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.” “Pardon,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?” “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said.",0
"Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman.",0
"And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament.",0
"And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences too! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders. This morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was urbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he alluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that I should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria. “You expect trouble, then?” I asked. His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far.",0
"No wonder she fainted! But since then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has played her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son’s sake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the criminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s past life.",0
"The spade didn’t come from there, but from the toolshed up by the house.” “Marvellous,” murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. “He has been here but half an hour, and he already knows everything! What a man! Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.” Although I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly impressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help feeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and it vexed me.",0
"I did not like to ask Poirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings. We alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something sharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the steps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously. A light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was opened cautiously a little way.",0
"I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “After all, it does not matter now.” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son.",0
"There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter.",0
"You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?” For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile. “That is so,” she acknowledged. “Were yours, too, left by hand by a Chinaman?” “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?” I recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened attentively. “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers.",0
"Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale.",0
"Confound the fellow and his prowling ways. Altogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast with poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of getting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired. Later. A very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray’s sealed letter. It didn’t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper! Now, I suppose, I’m in the devil of a mess.",0
"Is not that a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room now. But be careful be very careful. IAh, he is gone! And my friend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all so simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several hundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that singled them out from the rest at practically a glance. Their appearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!” “But there’s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,” I cried.",0
"” Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel’s face. “He’s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.” “Tell us about it.” “I mustn’t tell tales out of school.” “Tell us something even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.” “Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit’ having made the voyage with us?” “What?” I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again. Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. “It’s a fact, I believe.",0
"“I must have been very drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed. Take my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you, don’t go on the bust again.” “As you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.” “Much wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I haven’t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I said thoughtfully. “She wants to get to Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I’ve a good mind to offer her a temporary job as a secretary.",0
"“But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless disturbed had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death.",0
"“Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in getting the case dismissed but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer. He cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father’s disbelief.",0
"Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up.",0
"""English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.",0
"I was awfully surprised to find that she really was fond of me I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. When we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully, when I had finished. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you. Oh, Anne, dear, don’t be cross, but how do you know that this young man of yours is telling the truth? You believe every word he says.” “Of course I do,” I cried indignantly.",0
"In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.” “You permit, madame?” said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow. “I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time being,” said the inspector. “We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible.” Mr. Opalsen frowned. “Is that necessary?” “I’m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.” “Oh, let him take it, Ed!” cried his wife.",0
"My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A a fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs.",0
"” Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous in their methods. The thing worked. A powdered footman received the card and bore it away. Presently a pale secretary appeared. I fenced with him successfully. He retired defeated. He again reappeared and begged me to follow him. I did so. I entered a large room, a frightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant from the spirit-world. Then the door shut and I was face to face with Lord Nasby. A big man. Big head. Big face. Big moustache. Big stomach. I pulled myself together. I had not come here to comment on Lord Nasby’s stomach. He was already roaring at me.",0
"It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition a je ne sais quoi!” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side.",0
"Each man had his own pet theory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring in front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an amusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot’s behaviour moved me to intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat, clutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily. “Mon Dieu!” he murmured. “This is terrible!” “Have courage, Poirot,” I cried. “You will succeed. You will find him. I am sure of it.” “Ah, mon ami, you mistake my emotion.",0
"He was a small thin man, very brown of face, with light blue eyes and a small dark beard. “Just come from abroad,” I deduced. “That’s why his overcoat smells so. He’s come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn’t have a beard. Perhaps a tea-planter.” At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by fear almost panic.",0
"No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological heredity, mon ami, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?” “About five, I believe.” “That will do very well. We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.",0
"I could not see into the passage from where I sat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek as she turned to him. “You saw him there in the passage?” she cried. He was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his head. “I saw him my husband you must have seen him too?” “Madame, I saw nothing. You are not well unstrung” “I am perfectly well, IOh, God!” Suddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out. Out of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs. Maltravers moaning. And then I saw! The man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us, gleaming with a faint ghostly light.",0
"” What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance. “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?” Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast. “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.” “I’m with you there, sir.",0
"There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells. I will impart it to you ” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, ne vous impatientez pas! I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology.",0
"To begin with, Black answered well within the normal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘Day’ to ‘Night’ and ‘Place’ to ‘Name’ are normal associations. I began work with ‘Bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all. Evidently he had not.",0
"“My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?” “Oh, yes.” “Your father, as you know, was a very great man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.” I knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so. He continued: “I do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try to explain as clearly as I can.” He explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that I was left to face life with the sum of £87, 17s. 4d. It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next.",0
"Not till I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the ridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe freely once more. No arrest had been made, and I realized that it was a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined Suzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the hotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson. It was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought of Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the sure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight.",0
"Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I’m tired of secretaries, I won’t have any more secretaries. Either they’re concealed murderers or else they’re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have.",0
"Davenheim left the house?” “About half-past five or thereabouts.” “What lies beyond the rose-garden?” “A lake.” “With a boathouse?” “Yes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you’re thinking of suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don’t mind telling you that Miller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged. That’s the kind of man he is!” Poirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “Hastings, I pray you, hand me that copy of the Daily Megaphone. If I remember rightly, there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.” I rose, and found the sheet required.",0
"Then I realized by the pig-tail and the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.” She stopped with a shudder. The butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly. “A gentleman from Mr. Hoffberg’s, m’lord. He says you expect him.” “Good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “I must see him, I suppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.” I drew Poirot aside.",0
"“But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance.",0
"“And their children were just like children are to-day they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long well, it makes one what you would call cruel.",0
"le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “Eh bien! I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice.",0
"“Amen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time. But this is dark dark. I cannot see.” “Well, Poirot,” I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the Ministers, “what do you think?” My friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft movements. He shook his head thoughtfully. “I do not know what to think. My brains desert me.” “Why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do as well?” I mused. “Pardon me, mon ami, but I did not quite say that.",0
"We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned. You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. Later. Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot.",0
"I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out. “Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the affair at the Villa Geneviève?’ “Yes,” I said eagerly.",0
"Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo’burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn’t seen him this morning.",0
"The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know.",0
"""Of course,” began Giraud, “I soon saw through all that Chilian tomfoolery. Two men were in it but they were not mysterious foreigners! All that was a blind.” “Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “Especially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.” Giraud glared, but continued: “A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the grave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there was a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld’s quarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The motive was established.",0
"It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough. Any message that comes genuinely from me will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.",0
"I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my unchanging devotion.” “And you did see her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face. There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed.",0
"He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two.",0
"You shall go to Beira” “I’m not going to Beira,” I interrupted. “You are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself and throw you on to the boat. What do you think I’m made of? Do you think I’ll wake up night after night, fearing they’ve got you? One can’t go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back to England, Anne and and marry and be happy.” “With a steady man who’ll give me a good home!” “Better that than utter disaster.” “And what of you?” His face grew grim and set. “I’ve got my work ready to hand. Don’t ask what it is.",0
"I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “Mon ami! Vive l’amour! It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!” After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived.",0
"Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.” “But your contract here?” “I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will ever know that I have left France. And why do you think that I go?” “Hardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?” “Exactly.” She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. “You said just now that none of us had anything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have had the wit and, yes, the courage for it needs courage to double-cross him.",0
"There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying.",0
"” This was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace’s dictation: Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any possible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to Agrasato’s curio-shop. Ask to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” The man will then ask you to “come into the back room.” Go with him. You will find a messenger who will bring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the diamonds with you.",0
"Oh, you English! With nous autres it is different. Figure to yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war fled to Ostend. There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves. Impossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a horror mais une horreur! of the sea! What was she to do? Daily les Boches were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible situation!” “What did she do?” I inquired curiously. “Fortunately her husband was homme pratique. He was also very calm, the crises of the nerves, they affected him not.",0
"She explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a “secret” of far reaching European importance. They had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but Madame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members of the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. On the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to clean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open.",0
"“It is a quiet little place but chic! It lies about midway between Bolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English people who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in England, I suppose?” “Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the country, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little about him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. I believe he has large South American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life out in Chile and the Argentino.” “Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us pack.",0
"“Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. Célestine leaves the room again, and pst! in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer. “Madame arrives, the theft is discovered.",0
"“(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that she might have killed M. Renauld.",0
"It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa.",0
"Finally we were politely bowed out. “I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street. “You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.” “It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, mon ami. I do not expect to find in a Bank manager a ‘keen financier with an eagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am disappointed in the case it is too easy!” “Easy?” “Yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?” “You know who stole the bonds?” “I do.” “But then we must why” “Do not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going to do anything at present.",0
"Just as we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by the arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents. It was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure I had seen carved on the walls of the tomb. My blood literally froze at the sight. “Mon Dieu!” murmured Poirot, crossing himself vigorously. “Anubis, the jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.” “Some one is hoaxing us,” cried Dr. Tosswill, rising indignantly to his feet. “It went into your tent, Harper,” muttered Sir Guy, his face dreadfully pale.",0
"I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed.",0
"Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",0
"Jeanne went to answer it, and returned with a card in her hand. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at the sight of the name on the card, “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a sudden flicker of interest came into her eyes. “I will see him. The maize peignoir, Jeanne, and quickly. And when the Count comes you may go.” “Bien, Madame.” Jeanne brought the peignoir, an exquisite wisp of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to herself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo on the glass of the dressing-table. The Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to him a man of medium height, very slim, very elegant, very pale, extraordinarily weary.",0
"""Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted.",0
"But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there.",0
"She now tempted me with the advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the boat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry land. Muffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was hauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay there with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired young man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me. “Hullo! Feeling rather sorry for yourself, eh?” “Yes,” I replied, hating him. “Ah, you won’t know yourself in another day or two. We’ve had rather a nasty dusting in the Bay, but there’s smooth weather ahead.",0
"“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.",0
"Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy’s return. He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood. “Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?” I followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural.",0
"Renauld? Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night, some one who would benefit by his death the description fits Jack Renauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point. “Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There were two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that.",0
"The Daily Budget was hard up for a sensation. My guess was verified and proved to be correct and the Daily Budget had the scoop of its lifetime. “Victim of the Mill House Murder identified by our special reporter.” And so on. “Our reporter makes voyage with the murderer. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ What he is really like.” The main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers, but I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date! I received approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo.",0
"The “Colonel” and his gang must have no suspicion that there existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I knew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to Lord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer “Nadina” who had been delighting Paris for so long. It seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified already but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw how natural it really was. Nadina had never been to England during her successful career in Paris.",0
"""Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again in any other disguise, I mean?” asked Suzanne. I shook my head ruefully. “I certainly didn’t recognize him as the stewardess, and never should have but for your drawing.” “The man’s a professional actor, I’m sure of it,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “His make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you’d never spot him.” “You’re very cheering,” I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. “What is Sir Eustace doing?” asked Suzanne. “I haven’t seen him about to-day.",0
"All Papa’s friends were aged Professors usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a “neat little waist” and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a “neat little waist” since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always “felled their opponent with a single blow.",0
"I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the tram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying the sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream sodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the hotel. To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from the curator of the Museum.",0
"Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp.",0
" Johannesburg,  March 6th. There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi if you do, strikers pull you out again.",0
"Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along. Hence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected. My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in another moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He beamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced me warmly on the platform. “Mon cher ami, I have succeeded but succeeded to a marvel!” “Indeed? I’m delighted to hear it.",0
"He described the methods of housing the natives, the searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers took. “Then it’s practically impossible to steal any diamonds?” asked Mrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express purpose. “Nothing’s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.” “Yes, but on a large scale?” “Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?” I nodded. “Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld.",0
"“So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.” “En vérité! And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, mon cher?” I thought. “About a dozen times perhaps.” “And I once! Yet I recognize her, and you do not.” “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly. “Ah! Sacré!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.",0
"There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured.",0
"“You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett” “And you?” That was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the Kilmorden, or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat.",0
"I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life. If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13” like that. There was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle.",0
"He is quite a stranger to me.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure.” “You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?” “No,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. “No, I do not think so. Of course they wore beards false ones the examining magistrate thought, but still no.” Now she seemed to make her mind up definitely. “I am sure neither of the two was this man.” “Very well, madame. That is all, then.” She stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads in her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify the man, in a completely natural manner. Giraud merely grunted.",0
"Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.",0
"“Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.” Poirot was right. He always is, confound him! The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the following day.",0
"I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married even to Clarence!” I disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all.",0
"” Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the moment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question. I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the Daily Budget.",0
"Was I really good-looking? Honestly, I couldn’t say I thought so! I hadn’t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the things you ought to have. It is true that a curate once told me that my eyes were like “imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood” but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them off at random. I’d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow flecks! Still, green is a good colour for adventuresses. I wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and shoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down over my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual.",0
"“And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes” he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?” Sarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us.",0
"It might just as easily have been a grey hair and then, by no conceivable effort could Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack Renauld! But it is all of a piece.",0
"On the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her “lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. To intimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political intrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. There was also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with herself acting as the go-between. Amongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young lawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating Jeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the young man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her complete devotion to her middle-aged husband.",0
"“The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “Bien,” said Bex.",0
"Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together.",0
"I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! Diamonds!_” Diamonds! I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. “Are you sure, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear.",0
"” Poirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked than ever. “So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil murdered M. Renauld?” “Yes.” “Why?” He shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback. “Why?” I stammered. “Why? Oh, because ” I came to a stop. Poirot nodded his head at me. “You see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame Daubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld? We can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death; considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You cannot have a murder without a motive.",0
"Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs.",0
"What does it all mean?” Poirot handed him the copy of Society Gossip. “First, milord, I would ask you if these facts are substantially correct?” The peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read. “Damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “There’s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I believe. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.” “Still, the stone is known as ‘The Star of the East.’” “Well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully. Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply.",0
"If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully. Two bells went overhead. One o’clock! And nothing. Wait what was that? I heard the quick light patter of feet running running along the passage. Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell inside. “Save me,” he said hoarsely. “They’re after me.” It was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear footsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act.",0
"Renauld come in? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very wonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations, or otherwise, could affect her?” “Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that you’re wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her.",0
"""I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.” “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway” “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen.",0
"I followed him as meekly as the Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn’t carrying a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very difficult to keep up with him. “Harry,” I said at last, in a meek voice, “are we going to walk all the way to Rhodesia?” He turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me up in his arms. “I’m mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.” “We’re a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me, but I’m not making a sacrifice at all! I wanted to come!” That was two years ago. We still live on the island.",0
"No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you.",0
"“Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it.",0
"With your permission, mon ami, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.",0
"And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said: “But certainly. Ask them to enter.” In another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil. She was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue.",0
"Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something something that would happen soon. I was excited restless. After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge. It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls their elusive quality.",0
"I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused.",0
"Then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear. “Look, mon ami!” cried Poirot in triumph. I looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was dated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike, confectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman. “But is it legal?” I gasped. “As far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the testator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.",0
"’” “At expensive French watering-places?” “Dirt cheap if you know where to go.” I eyed her keenly. “Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?” “We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously. “There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime at the Villa Geneviève ?” She stared at me.",0
"""It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves or some one walking over my grave. I keep feeling something dreadful’s going to happen.” “Don’t be silly,” said Suzanne, with decision. “Let’s talk of something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.",0
"""They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t think for an instant” Poirot raised his hand. “Tout doucement, mon ami. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see” Poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed to be amusing him vastly. “And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!” “What on earth” “And stars give light! Voilà! Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.",0
"Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.",0
"“Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in my power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press ever so little. “Like this and squeeze the life out of you! And then like our unconscious friend here, but with more success fling your dead body to the sharks.",0
"“Then, évidemment, we must find out just how we stand. When did Mr. Schneider’s death take place?” “Three days ago.” “You are sure it was tetanus?” “Dead sure.” “It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for instance?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a clear case of tetanus.” “Did you not inject anti-serum?” “Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing that could be done was tried.” “Had you the anti-serum with you?” “No. We procured it from Cairo.",0
"""It must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like you.” “Well, I’m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and goes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking.",0
"""I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I can assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.” “I hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me, Sir Eustace.” “Recognized you where?” “At Marlow, Sir Eustace?” “At Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?” “I thought you understood that” “I’m beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning of the story and start again. You went to Florence” “Then you don’t know after all and you didn’t recognize me!” “As far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away needlessly made a coward of by your conscience.",0
"But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.” He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. “Information?” “Something of the kind.” “Diamonds,” I said to myself. “And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.” For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables.",0
"“At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.” Pagett’s voice dropped again. “But that’s camouflage, I’m sure. So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck.",0
"” We did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot effected a rapid change of clothing. “I go to London to-night,” he explained. “It is imperative.” “What?” “Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!” “You’ll come a cropper one of these days,” I observed, rather disgusted by his vanity. “Do not be enraged, I beg of you, mon ami. I count on you to do me a service of your friendship.” “Of course,” I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness.",0
"The windows were fastened securely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having intervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is likely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained undetected until Monday.” “Précisément,” said Poirot dryly. “Well, is he arrested, ce pauvre M. Lowen?” Japp grinned. “Not yet. But he’s under pretty close supervision.” Poirot nodded.",0
"""You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile.",0
"“I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!” I pondered the matter. “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. Bonne mère, très femme!” “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.",0
"I was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her.",0
"I came out on to the stoep early on the following morning and looked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer’s wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the stoep_, a book in my hand which I did not read.",0
"“My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning. The girl with the anxious eyes! Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld’s behalf, for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.” “By the way,” I exclaimed, “how is Jack Renauld?” “Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite.",0
"In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into the car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to die down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence incriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were holding the Prime Minister? Our return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We deviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally stopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital.",0
"” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t you can’t not if you knew ” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house ” I paused. “Go on what next?” “I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links ” Again I paused.",0
"Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.” She stopped.",0
"What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. SomethingAh! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.",0
"” I shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed. “But console yourself, mon ami,” said Poirot, calming down. “All cannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.” “You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever knew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance. “What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share that opinion even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “Without doubt. She is coming here.” “How do you make that out?” “Very simply.",0
"In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne’s sympathetic murmurs. (She does that sort of thing very well.) “First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house on purpose to annoy me, I do believe.",0
"At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly.",0
"He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at this juncture, he suddenly asked: “M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?” “No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there is here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.” “A bunkair?” Poirot turned to me. “That is the irregular hole filled with sand and a bank at one side, is it not?” I concurred. “You do not play the golf, M. Poirot?” inquired Bex.",0
"Renauld’s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to take them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame Renauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart. That night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then, taking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground where he knows a how do you call it? bunkair? is to be made. It is essential that the body should be found Madame Daubreuil must have no suspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as to identity will be greatly lessened. Then, M.",0
"Poirot studied the features attentively. “H’m!” he murmured. “Wears his hair rather long and wavy, full moustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?” “Yes.” “Hair and beard turning grey?” The detective nodded. “Well, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to say to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?” “On the contrary, most obscure.” The Scotland Yard man looked pleased. “Which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished Poirot placidly. “Eh?” “I find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear as daylight eh bien, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.” Japp shook his head almost pityingly. “Well, each to their fancy. But it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.” “I do not see,” murmured Poirot.",0
"I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these ‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life.",0
"He seemed lost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme mental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in doubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and turning to Japp, he asked: “Have you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim occupied the same bedroom?” The question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. “Good Lord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something startling.",0
"""What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know but a scar can be faked easily enough. He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of anthropology. “Dolichocephalic,” I said lightly. Suzanne looked doubtful. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,” I explained fluently. There was a pause.",0
"“I make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless Célestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room in the morning while Célestine is present, and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise she never enters the room.” “Well, as I was saying,” continued Mrs. Opalsen, “I came up. I went to the drawer here,” she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table “took out my jewel-case and unlocked it. It seemed quite as usual but the pearls were not there!” The inspector had been busy with his notebook. “When had you last seen them?” he asked.",0
"She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.” Denise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him. “Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?” Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely: “I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it.",0
"” Then, frowning, he gazed down at the body. “Should you say that was a Spanish type at all?” he asked suddenly. I considered the face carefully. “No,” I said at last. “I should put him down as a Frenchman most decidedly.” Giraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction. “Same here.” He stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of the floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by inch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks.",0
"“But it’s been happy, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been hell!” “As bad as that!” “What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you say that laughing into your hair?” “I wasn’t laughing. And I’m not mocking. If you want me to go, I’ll go. But if you want me to stay I’ll stay.” “Not that!” he cried vehemently. “Not that. Don’t tempt me, Anne. Do you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down. They know me here as Harry Parker they think I’ve been away on a trek up country, but any day they may put two and two together and then the blow will fall.",0
"""It appears so, mon ami,” said Poirot cautiously. “Appearances are deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.” As we hurried in a taxi to the Magnificent, I puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme. “That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.” “Ma foi!” said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse. “One cannot think of everything!” I felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind. “Cheer up,” I said consolingly. “Better luck next time.” At the Magnificent, we were ushered at once into the manager’s office.",0
"""In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company.",0
"It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter.",0
"But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud. “What are your grounds for arresting him?” “Do you expect me to give them to you?” “As a matter of courtesy, yes.” Giraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary. “You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered. “It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice. Giraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red. “Eh bien, come in here.",0
"""Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.” The magistrate nodded. “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.",0
"My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know.",0
"” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered. Arrived at the Villa Geneviève, Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open.",0
"“An idiot of a steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a moment!” “Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. “He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires you very much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.” “I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable than a hat.” I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race.",0
"“You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well.",0
"His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily in the back.” It was my turn to gape and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a doubt crossed my mind. “Poirot,” I cried, “you’re pulling my leg. You’ve heard all about it already.” He turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully. “Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing whatsoever.",0
"Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open. “You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes though not always then and it is against that that we are going to make provision.” He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes.",0
"You see I care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?” “No,” I whispered. “It was since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand and it frightened me.",0
"I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or less.” “There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate say a case of burglary can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.",0
"By the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the syringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld’s hand. What would he say, the excellent M. Hautet? ‘Poor woman! What did I tell you? The shock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most tragic case, the Renauld Case!’ “However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her. There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil.",0
"Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him to catch it.",0
"I believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!” “Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!” “Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.” The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly. “Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,” explained the latter. “Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion.",0
"I imitated her example most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined.",0
"Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen.” Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless.",0
"It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race’s men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.” Sir Eustace turned suddenly. “Very clever. Very creditable. But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you. You’ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that’s all you’ve got against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her and your record’s against you.",0
"I didn’t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide. “It is extraordinary to me,” said the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward. His name and address should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular not to do so.” I smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor. In pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard at an early date. But the next morning brought a surprise.",0
"“Why, you surely don’t think you can’t” “The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a matter of fact I did think. If Ridgeway had been the thief which was perfectly possible the case would have been charming; a piece of neat methodical work.” “But not so charming for Miss Farquhar.” “Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now, Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes, as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air.",0
"You’re a thief, remember, a thief. There’s one thing you don’t know, perhaps. I’ve got the diamonds. And here goes” With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite. “There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we’ll talk. I’ll drive a bargain with you. You’ve got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. There’s a chance for me if I can get away. I’m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man! There’s a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes’ start and I shall be all right.",0
"She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him. She is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow.",0
"I had the girl’s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn’t got it on you a minute ago?” “Yes, I had,” I replied. “It was in my stocking.” “I don’t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table.",0
"I shall label this car not “Sir Eustace Pedler and Party,” but “Colonel Race and Harem.” Then Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every time we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed higher and higher, she snapped at the engine. “You see the point,” she cried delightedly. “It must be some curve if you can photograph the front part of the train from the back, and with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.” I pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly. “I shall write underneath it: ‘Taken from the train.",0
"""But I demand pardon if I am dense, madame surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?” A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older. “I want to wear it down there.” “Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?” “That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly.",0
"Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up against civilization.” “Mon ami,” said Poirot, “you make one error.",0
"Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could.",0
"“Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll.” When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke. “It is as well, mon ami, that we have no affairs of moment on hand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.” “What investigation are you talking about?” “The remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new flat.” “Poirot, you are not serious!” “I am most serious.",0
"There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat.",0
"But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place. I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something.",0
"“I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless like I am. That’s the secret of strength and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not.",0
"There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films which I must have dropped somewhere later and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow.",0
"For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch.",0
"” Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: “I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.” We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I thought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as ever, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor.",0
"The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. “23rd May. M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. “24th May. M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “7th June. Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter written to M.",0
"Of course Giraud is all wrong wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not because of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all that I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts not by my leading you by the hand.",0
"They could hardly have been hidden on board and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the Olympia’s arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the Olympia got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.” “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?” “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.",0
"Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded believed killed.” That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I got it all out of him, little by little.",0
"“Ah, that is just what I do not understand! It is inexplicable stupid! They have all their arrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the abduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost impossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not twenty miles from London!” “Perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other,” I suggested. “Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor in the first affair, anyway.",0
"Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her tête-à-tête with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They are the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well.",0
"” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back.",0
"But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. Style anglais, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M.",0
"He had found” Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically. “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?” “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.” “Shooting rooks, eh?” “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.” “Where is this little rook rifle now?” “In the hall, I think.” She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.",0
"“It is really insupportable,” he murmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!” “Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars that is, if you know!” “Eh bien, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!” “Do you know where he is hiding?” “Certainly! It is most ingenious.",0
"When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa. I have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at last the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins me to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by his master’s side.",0
"Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well I warned you.",0
"Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur.",0
"By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country.",0
"“My friends, if I were hiding from the police, do you know where I should hide? In a prison!” “What?” “You are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison, so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there!” “What do you mean?” “You tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman. Nevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and confronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him! In spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close.",0
"To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered. “No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.” “Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said. “Let us start from the beginning.",0
"Suzanne left her face half anointed and pressed for details. I gave them to her. “It all gets more and more mysterious,” she cried. “I thought I was going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that you would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but now I’m not so sure. I hope Pagett won’t push me off the train some dark night.” “I think you’re still above suspicion, Suzanne. But, if the worst happens, I’ll wire to Clarence.” “That reminds me give me a cable form. Let me see now, what shall I say.",0
"""Had he any reason to believe that you and I might be friendly with each other?” “He might have had,” I answered thoughtfully, remembering our conversation on the way back from the Matoppos. “He’s a very powerful personality,” I continued, “but not at all my idea of the ‘Colonel.’ And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He’s in the Secret Service.” “How do we know that he is? It’s the easiest thing in the world to throw out a hint of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the rumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you like Race?” “I do and I don’t.",0
"When I had finished he said unexpectedly: “What do you know of brachycephalic heads?” I mentioned Papa. “The Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind upon your own shoulders, young woman. But it’s all pretty thin, you know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us as it stands.” “I’m perfectly aware of that.” “What d’you want, then?” “I want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.” “Can’t do that. We’ve got our own special man on it.” “And I’ve got my own special knowledge.” “What you’ve just told me, eh?” “Oh, no, Lord Nasby. I’ve still got something up my sleeve.” “Oh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl.",0
"” There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could “fell” an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela.” Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair.",0
"” We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us. “Japp!” I ejaculated. The Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion. “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.” “My wife” “I’ve seen your good lady, sir and the housekeeper. I won’t keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.” “I know nothing as yet as to what” “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly.",0
"Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting. “Good,” said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. “I will take these with me for the ‘Colonel’ to see.” “When do you leave?” “Ten o’clock to-morrow morning will do.” “Do you want to see the girl before you go?” “No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the ‘Colonel’ comes. Is she all right?” “I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I think.",0
"“Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again will I vaunt my little grey cells!” “That’s a good job at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this all about?” As usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely no attention to me. “The tradesmen’s books I have left them entirely out of account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at once.” Easier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter, and there Poirot hired a car.",0
"When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong.",0
"""What does he himself say to that?” “Denied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid was positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose. Rather a weak story! And there’s fresh evidence against him come to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well, that ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called Billy Kellett! He’s already known to the police did three months last autumn for lifting an old gentleman’s watch.",0
"""I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.” “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning that is so, is it not?” “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me.",0
"Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently.",0
"“Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little salon.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say ” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us.",0
"” Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required.",0
"“Well, what is it? What does Loamsley want? You his secretary? What’s it all about?” “To begin with,” I said with as great an appearance of coolness as I could manage, “I don’t know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows nothing about me. I took his card from the tray in the house of the people I’m staying with, and I wrote those words on it myself. It was important that I should see you.” For a moment it appeared to be a toss up as to whether Lord Nasby had apoplexy or not. In the end, he swallowed twice and got over it. “I admire your coolness, young woman.",0
"My sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless, and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I cherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He evidently admired her enormously. Our interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to believe the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty.",0
"Renauld left the house to keep an appointment possibly with the murderer leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat.",0
"“He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks him down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and find Pagett lying there. How’s that?” “You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.",0
"""But why?” “Parbleu! so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you.” “What?” “Mais, oui to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was dissatisfied. It was not strong enough!” He paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement: “And so, mon ami, since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible.” “Merlinville,” I murmured thoughtfully. “I’ve heard of it, I think.” Poirot nodded.",0
"Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess.",0
"Well, you see me! If you interest me, you will continue to see me for exactly two minutes longer.” “That will be ample,” I replied. “And I shall interest you. It’s the Mill House Mystery.” “If you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ write to the Editor,” he interrupted hastily. “If you will interrupt, I shall be more than two minutes,” I said sternly. “I haven’t found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ but I’m quite likely to do so.” In as few words as possible I put the facts of the Tube accident and the conclusions I had drawn from them before him.",0
"""But why?” “Because if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy, suspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft, really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in New York and returns by the first boat available.",0
"In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent, that he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that he had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded the mission to South America as connected with business interests. As M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in. “I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.” “By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly. Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table. “Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?” “Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily.",0
"You know what women are. She’s all for this film stunt.” “I comprehend,” said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought, then rose briskly to his feet. “You return to Yardly Chase at once? Bien! Say no word to anyone to anyone mind but expect us there this evening. We will arrive shortly after five.” “All right, but I don’t see” “Ça n’a pas d’importance,” said Poirot kindly. “You will that I preserve for you your diamond, n’est-ce pas?” “Yes, but” “Then do as I say.” A sadly bewildered nobleman left the room. It was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs.",0
"""Six months.” “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and” “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.” He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside. “Eh bien, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?” I did not reply. Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going.",0
"I don’t know what bêche-de-mer is, I never have known, I probably never shall know. I’ve guessed once or twice and guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to talk about a stoep_ I do know what a stoep is it’s the thing round a house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you call it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw.",0
"Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish.",0
"There are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various aliases. The American Secret Service, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye upon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington. They felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question. One of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face of it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.",0
"Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr.",0
"There was only one diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, celui-là! “But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled. “For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.” “Lady Yardly?” “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance.",0
"I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll.",0
"The wind was getting up, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp. “Ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried Poirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then turned the key in the lock. “I shall lock it, so!” “Don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now” And even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door slowly swung open.",0
"To begin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion of his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him to Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet he was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must have lent him the money.” “All that was very thin,” I objected. “But there was more.",0
"A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned.",0
"But it has led to nothing.” “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?” A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced anyone above suspicion.” “Très bien. Now I understand, milord, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?” Lord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes.",0
"’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he thinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ But we shall see.…” But my mind had reverted to the main facts. “Then all this story of the masked men ?” “Is false.” “What really happened?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “One person could tell us Madame Renauld. But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my opinion.",0
"You can understand that we must lose no time if we are not already too late.” The manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered the flat. We passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the right of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod. “The dining-room.” Dr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we entered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though their occupants had just risen.",0
"The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.” He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly. “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously. Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring: “Not precisely to-day,” he replied. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor.",0
"“Nothing more you can tell us about him?” he demanded, as I rose to depart. “Yes,” I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. “His head was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to alter that.” I observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow’s pen wavered. It was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic. In the first heat of indignation I found my next step unexpectedly easy to tackle. I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went into Scotland Yard.",0
"In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell. My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned. “Here you are and here you stay,” he remarked facetiously. I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. “I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.",0
"In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, mon ami, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go up to the Villa Geneviève.",0
"He still seemed to be thinking. “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.” “But the maid did!” “Why do you say that?” “Why,” I stammered, “they were found actually in her mattress.” “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.",0
"But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged. “She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his head towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville.",0
"He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter. “Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called ‘book knowledge.",0
"Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.",0
"A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him.",0
"Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.",0
"You’re so young, Anne, and so beautiful with the kind of beauty that sends men mad. All the world’s before you love, life, everything. Mine’s behind me scorched, spoiled, with a taste of bitter ashes.” “If you don’t want me” “You know I want you. You know that I’d give my soul to pick you up in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for ever and ever. And you’re tempting me, Anne. You, with your long witch’s hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green and never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I’ll save you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night.",0
"Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others. “Mother!” “Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what brings you here? You were to sail on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others, she turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.",0
"“Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics.",0
"Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.",0
"Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly. “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us.",0
"” He looked down at the body again. “As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wore gloves.” “You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. “Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared at the doorway. “Monsieur?” “Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago?” “She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.” “Good. I only want one at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared again.",0
"""What is that?” “A mistake even a little mistake on the part of the murderer.” He stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and shook his head. “Monsieur,” he said to the manager, “explain to me, I pray, your system of serving meals here.” The manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall. “This is the service lift,” he explained. “It runs to the kitchens at the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and the dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic worries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant.",0
"Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed.",0
"If I have made a mistake” “A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!” He laughed coarsely. “What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police” “Yap, yap, yap like a little toy dog.” He laughed. I sat down on a chair. “I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,” I said coldly. “Indeed?” “I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?” “So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?” Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances.",0
"Blair without Colonel Race,” Pagett interposed. “He’s asked her to dine with him, I know.” Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. “Who is Race?” I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. “They say he’s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don’t know for certain.” “Isn’t that like the Government?” I exclaimed. “Here’s a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone.” Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice.",0
"Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically: “At last you have seen the detective you admire the human foxhound! Is it not so, my friend?” “At any rate, he’s doing something,” I said, with asperity. “If there’s anything to find, he’ll find it. Now you ” “Eh bien! I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.” “Nonsense, Poirot. You know very well that’s got nothing to do with it. I meant little things traces that may lead us infallibly to the murderers.",0
"“He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none.",0
"“But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules Poirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case.",0
"You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?” “Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.” “We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country.” “Comment? My old friend the Préfet?” Lord Estair shook his head. “One higher than the Préfet. One whose word was once law in Belgium and shall be again! That England has sworn!” Poirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute.",0
"“Pourquoi? Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit yes; but one cannot suspect institutions.” “Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,” I suggested. Poirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care. “That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal man can do.",0
"“To-morrow you’ll have some questions to answer, and after you’ve answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we’ve more ways than one of making obstinate little fools talk.” It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until to-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.",0
"I had always vaguely associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong that is a lava-lava. At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I can’t help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of bacon-bacon, and then go out clad in a jumper-jumper to pay the books. Suzanne was a little tamer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a lovely view right out over Table Bay. I looked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some special face-cream. When she had found it and started an immediate application, she became capable of listening to me.",0
"Every port watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!” “Not Mr. Pagett?” “Oh, not Pagett the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.” “Have they arrested him?” asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring squeeze. I waited breathlessly for an answer. “He seems to have disappeared into thin air.” “How does Sir Eustace take it?” “Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.” An opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace’s views on the matter presented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note.",0
"“I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.",0
"“But where did their ‘method’ break down?” “Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark” “I remember,” I cried. “Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!” There was a moment’s silence. “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me. “This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed.",0
"“Come, come, mon ami. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! Bien! All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.” It was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught. “I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that” Poirot held up his hand. “My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.",0
"When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense” “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly.",0
"We were cut off from the world, alone together as Adam and Eve might have been but with what a difference! Old Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have done. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much of it as I could manage with one arm. Harry was out a good part of the time, but we spent long hours together lying out in the shade of the palms, talking and quarrelling discussing everything under high heaven, quarrelling and making it up again. We bickered a good deal, but there grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I could never have believed possible. That and something else.",0
"Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder ” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M.",0
"This street, it is not aristocratic, mon ami! In it there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist still less is there a fashionable milliner! But there is a fashionable detective. Oui, my friend, it is true I am become the mode, the dernier cri! One says to another: ‘Comment? You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too marvellous! Every one goes! Courez!’ And they arrive! In flocks, mon ami! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below. “What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.",0
"“I have made all arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned.",0
"“I do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardt’s intelligence by telling her.” With a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone. “They are stitched in the lining of that.” “Clever,” murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the door. “Good evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New York whilst you make your getaway.” “Whatta fool!” roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he fired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as I flung myself upon him.",0
"“Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.” “Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?” “Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.",0
"The principal finds had been removed to Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting. The enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that I detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we entered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before joining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in Arabic. Poirot stopped.",0
"A secret meeting for orders!” “Don’t hiss at me, Pagett,” I said, drawing back a little, “and do control your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. “Something was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.” “You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only part of the story that he wasn’t vague about.",0
"On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer.",0
"And you were right.” I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance. “My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.” “Ended?” “But yes. They are arrested.” “Who are arrested?” “The chambermaid and the valet, parbleu! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?” “You said cabinet-makers used it.” “Certainly they do to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot.",0
"“The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.” “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver. “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch.",0
"Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest.",0
"""And your theory is?” “For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations.” “Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.” “Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.",0
"One comes to hold life and death very lightly.” “Yes,” I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do though they are, I suppose.",0
"Nevertheless, many spiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her lover and not the only one! When the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another personage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of the United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming and mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful. About this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried on her husband’s behalf.",0
"” Everybody has been at me, right and left, to write this story from the great (represented by Lord Nasby) to the small (represented by our late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in England. “Lor’, miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all just like the pictures!”). I’ll admit that I’ve certain qualifications for the task. I was mixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick of it all through, and I was triumphantly “in at the death.",0
"The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county.",0
"It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale if it were all would indeed be plain sailing it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one.",0
"They persisted in regarding the whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so I thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining the paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.” “Short-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here’s all I can do for you. Go on working on this line of yours. If you get anything anything that’s publishable send it along and you shall have your chance. There’s always room for real talent on the Daily Budget. But you’ve got to make good first. See?” I thanked him, and apologized for my methods. “Don’t mention it. I rather like cheek from a pretty girl.",0
"On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser.",0
"” The inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us with a grin. “Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. It’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these Italian vendetta things, as likely as not.” Thus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was full of excitement. “Like the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn’t believe it if you read about it.” Poirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he had hardly opened his lips.",0
"That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.” “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?” “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr.",0
"Blair hailed me as I came on deck. “Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though you hadn’t slept well.” “Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently. “Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t bore me to death to talk to.” “That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you only it’s more understandable in your case. You’re you’re such an exquisitely finished product.",0
"Then dreams again long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him warn him what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger some great danger and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. By some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and aching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with rough wooden walls.",0
"His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.",0
"Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, c’est l’Anglais! Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age.",0
"It never answers.” “I agree with you, mon ami. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.” His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again her voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with empressement: “I will.” Well, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had had time to reflect. I did not like the girl.",0
"Only” “Yes?” “Eh bien, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to make up as himself again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right.",0
"""It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?” “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew.",0
"He repels me and at the same time fascinates me; but I know one thing, I’m always a little afraid of him.” “He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley robbery,” said Harry slowly. “But it was he who told Suzanne all about the ‘Colonel’ and how he had been in Paris trying to get on his track.” “Camouflage_ of a particularly clever kind.” “But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race’s pay?” “Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, “he doesn’t come in at all.” “What?” “Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s own account of that night on the Kilmorden?” “Yes through Sir Eustace.” I repeated it. Harry listened closely.",0
"I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily.",0
"After our recent conversation, he gave ‘Dinner’ to my ‘Tuesday,’ but ‘Journey’ and ‘Country’ were answered by ‘Ship’ and ‘Uganda,’ showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here. ‘Story’ recalls to him one of the ‘Lion’ stories he told at dinner. I proceed to ‘Rook Rifle’ and he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘Farm.’ When I say ‘Shot,’ he answers at once ‘Suicide.’ The association seems clear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere.",0
"But to my intense surprise I heard a light footfall on the deck behind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned. “I want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last night.” “It it was a peculiar night,” I said hastily. It was not a very lucid remark, but it was absolutely the only thing I could think of. “Will you forgive me?” I held out my hand without a word. He took it. “There’s something else I want to say.” His gravity deepened.",0
"""Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago.",0
"But his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance aside. “Then, that’s all right,” I said hastily. Saturday evening saw us dining at the Grand Metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at Brighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste were something magnificent. “Hein, it is a sight this!” murmured Poirot. “This is the home of the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?” “Supposed to be,” I replied. “But we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred with the Profiteering brush.” Poirot gazed round him placidly. “The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains to crime, instead of to its detection.",0
"to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.” About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street. “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked.",0
"Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “Pardon M. Hautet,” I cried, “but will you permit me to ask him one question?” “But certainly, monsieur.” Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. “Where do you keep your boots?” “Sac à papier!” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?” “But when you go to bed at night?” “Under my bed.” “But who cleans them?” “Nobody.",0
"Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up. Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points.",0
"In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside.",0
"“Miss Beddingfeld got the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.” I looked at him severely. “If you’re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who is a missionary though a perfectly poisonous person and that attractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don’t believe a word of it,” I said coldly. “Anne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl with particularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.” Pagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld’s legs.",0
"My words startled her still more. “To South Africa? My dear Anne. We would have to look into anything of that kind very carefully.” That was the last thing I wanted. I explained that I had already taken my passage, and that upon arrival I proposed to take up the duties of a parlourmaid. It was the only thing I could think of on the spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to taking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at getting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further query.",0
"I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive.",0
"I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton.",0
"“I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,” I said coldly. “I can at least relieve you of my presence.” He started for the door, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed him down upon the sofa. “Don’t be a fool,” I said unceremoniously. “You don’t want to go bleeding all over the ship, do you?” He seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as best I could. “There,” I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, “that will have to do for the present.",0
"“Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.” Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion.",0
"If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas.",0
"I hate being involved. All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral. Guy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working fellow, admirable in every respect. I know no one who annoys me more. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to get rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face.",0
"“Still, you know, he is superstitious, the old man. Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these fortune-telling people. She prophesied a lifetime of success, but declared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.” He had interested her now. She looked up eagerly. “That is strange, very strange! Through a woman, you say?” He smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “Doubtless, now that he has retired, he will marry. Some young society beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he acquired them.” Nadina shook her head. “No, no, that is not the way of it.",0
"It is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.” “But why?” “Because uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the Prime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the situation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will the Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive? Nobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done. And, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what les Boches are playing for.",0
"He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be rolling. You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence my husband, you know. It’s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.",0
"Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends arriving.” A mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker. “How did you know this address?” I asked as I followed Poirot out into the hall. “Oh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson followed when she left the other flat.” “A la bonne heure, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last. Now for a little surprise for Japp.” Softly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat’s head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing “Miaow.” The Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another man, jumped in spite of himself. “Oh, it’s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!” he exclaimed, as Poirot’s head followed that of the cat.",0
"That’s just the kind of secret he would have a wife and four children. “Have you told this to any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.” I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance. “I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now that you’ve blinking well torn it!” I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in. The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands.",0
"“So, having pardon the expression rather made a mess of things, don’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?” “And the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the chef of Lord Yardly has prepared?” “Oh, what’s dinner!” I said impatiently. Poirot held up his hands in horror. “Mon Dieu! It is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference.” “There’s another reason why we should get back to London as soon as possible,” I continued. “What is that, my friend?” “The other diamond,” I said, lowering my voice. “Miss Marvell’s.” “Eh bien, what of it?” “Don’t you see?” His unusual obtuseness annoyed me.",0
"“You assert that positively?” “Yes.” “No little disputes, eh?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of opinion now and then.” “Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for Paris, that person, without doubt, would be lying?” I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know everything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question. “We we did have an argument,” he admitted. “Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this phrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’” “I may have done,” muttered the other.",0
"Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift.",0
"Maltravers? You did not know, I see, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.” “You mean my story suggested to him oh, but that is awful!” “Do not distress yourself it would have been one way or another. Well, I must get on the telephone to London.” Poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back thoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was not till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off no longer, but must break the news to the young widow.",0
"I fished about until I found some old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over my bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth. The whole effect pleased me very much. “Anna the Adventuress,” I said aloud, nodding at my reflection. “Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, ‘The House in Kensington’!” Girls are foolish things. In the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored. Mrs.",0
"“It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Grünberg at Marlow and that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s business was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate. No the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt to put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town by no possible means could he have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town.",0
"She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far.",0
"London! The place for things to happen. “It’s awfully kind of you,” I said. “Might I really? Just while I’m looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?” “Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something suitable.” I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of “something suitable” and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. “That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?” “Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming” “My wife will be delighted to welcome you.",0
"Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them. Rolf nodded to us as we entered. “We’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it’s almost unbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can’t think.” A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit.",0
"But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can I have written him fully but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!” Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction. Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.",0
"He’s leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I see,” I said thoughtfully. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.” I turned the matter over in my mind. “Well,” I said at last, “it’s awkward but it’s safe enough. We’d better do nothing for the present.” Suzanne looked at me with a little smile. “You don’t like doing nothing, do you, Anne?” “Not very much,” I replied honestly. The one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see what time Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I found that it would arrive at 5.",0
"We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and worry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth order. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and above-board, eh bien, méfiez vous! It is, how do you say it? cooked! The great criminal is simple but very few criminals are great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably betray themselves. Ah, mon ami, I would that some day I could meet a really great criminal one who commits his crime, and then does nothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.” But I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me. “Poirot! Mrs.",0
"” The letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold characteristic hand: “Villa Geneviève Merlinville-sur-Mer France “Dear Sir, “I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I will give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have heard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be discreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account of a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life.",0
"What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real. Just at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would not have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. With a short laugh he released me. “What’s your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet.",0
"""Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish.",0
"We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention to anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study. “I have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my friend,” he deigned to remark. “Now, behold!” Going straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the envelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly hope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care he cut open the envelope, laying it out flat.",0
"Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.” She shook her head vigorously. “What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile. “A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too. Italian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.” “I shan’t. I like you did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.",0
"“I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.",0
"A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace.",0
"“She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter.",0
"Nevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the English papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details. Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole matter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance. The remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot’s point of view struck me at once. “Poirot,” I said, “I congratulate you.",0
"It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts. From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.",0
"One to be carried out if my interview there was unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That is, if I had the nerve to go through with it. Things that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily tackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect, I walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby. Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the Daily Budget. He owned other papers several of them, but the Daily Budget was his special child. It was as the owner of the Daily Budget that he was known to every householder in the United Kingdom.",0
"All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one. Très bien, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as the Olympia is in, but some one must travel on the Olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery.",0
"“Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it and the wonder, I shall not forget no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “Mon ami,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well.",0
"“How did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?” Poirot smiled placidly at him. “Ah, mon ami, after your wire, it was a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable.",0
"A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler. Lady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward uncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little man was equal to the occasion. “All my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss Marvell’s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure.",0
"""Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying.",0
"But he proceeded diplomatically: “Yes, the ‘Colonel’ has always been a generous paymaster. I attribute much of his success to that and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat. A great brain, undoubtedly a great brain! And an apostle of the maxim, ‘If you want a thing done safely, do not do it yourself!’ Here are we, every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not one of us has anything on him.” He paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with him, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before. “Not one of us,” he mused.",0
"""Why?” “To find a possible witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love.",0
"But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.” “Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “Mon ami, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to the facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason not like Giraud but like Hercule Poirot.” “But are you sure?” “My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile.",0
"He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?” His eyes challenged us. “But I Hercule Poirot tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within here!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within.",0
"I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do.",0
"Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball.",0
"Together they drag him into the shed as we know, the event had occurred just outside and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no resemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French type. That is sufficient. “I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot from the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The identification must rest solely on Madame Renauld’s evidence. Jack Renauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must be got out of the way.",0
"And then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris, was sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and, without revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of the crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at Madame Beroldy’s instigation. The crime had been planned between them.",0
"It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch.",0
"All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly.",0
"Maman made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.",0
"My friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful face upon me. “Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier? His system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “Quelle idée! You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.",0
"“I thought you were my secretary,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. Thursday night. We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds? At last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems that she’s a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs. Blair’s cabin, she must have been reading aloud all her special articles for years to come.",0
"There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending over him. “Did you hit him again?” I called breathlessly. “There was no need,” he replied grimly. “I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands. Rayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation.",0
"“Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively. We pulled up in front of the station. Here surely he would leave us. I turned with outstretched hand but no. “I’ll come and see you off. It’s just eight o’clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.” He gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train.",0
"He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he digs and then ” “Yes?” “And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.… Now, Hastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of two crimes. The first crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to investigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged Hercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to solve that will be difficult since the criminal in his wisdom, has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by M.",0
"He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.” “That is all you have to tell me?” “Yes.” “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?” “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.",0
"“To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.” We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests: “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?” “Yes somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think” “That you will need it? It is quite possible.",0
"“You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile.",0
"I loved it loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there always always. Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home.",0
"” The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt? I wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s reply was prompt: “Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.",0
"Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained.",0
"“There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated.",0
"“What terrible voice? Who is it, and what’s the trouble?” “It was the telephone, doctor. I answered it and a voice spoke. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor help. They’ve killed me!’ Then it sort of tailed away. ‘Who’s speaking?’ I said. ‘Who’s speaking?’ Then I got a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘Foscatine’ something like that ‘Regent’s Court.’” The doctor uttered an exclamation. “Count Foscatini. He has a flat in Regent’s Court. I must go at once. What can have happened?” “A patient of yours?” asked Poirot. “I attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian, but he speaks English perfectly.",0
"Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels.",0
"” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills.",0
"You may laugh if you like, but I’m not going to be this blasted old Men-her-Ra’s next victim. He’ll get me if I stop here.” The young man wiped the perspiration from his brow. Poirot turned away. Over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile: “Remember, he got one of his victims in New York.” “Oh, hell!” said Mr. Harper forcibly. “That young man is nervous,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “He is on the edge, but absolutely on the edge.” I glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me nothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were taken round the excavations.",0
"‘The secret! Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself.",0
"""You don’t think?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make.",0
"You never saw such a woman! Forty, if she’s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular slab-faced woman.” “Won’t she hold your hand?” “I devoutly hope not!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “That would be the last straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan’t give you the skin after the base way you’ve deserted me.” He squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for me in the hall. She was to come down to see me off. “Let’s start at once,” I said hastily, and motioned to the man to get a taxi.",0
"I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out.",0
"Well, what is it?” “When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece of paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead man. The doctor didn’t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some figures.” “Let’s see it.” Lord Nasby stretched out a careless hand. “I think not,” I said, smiling. “It’s my find, you see.” “I’m right. You are a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it. No scruples about not handing it over to the police?” “I went there to do so this morning.",0
"“Do you know, I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?” “You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.” “But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?” “Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did yes but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.” “What?” “Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away.",0
"” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.",0
"The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all. What do you think, M. le docteur?” “I can only say that it is most abnormal.” “It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed after he was dead.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M.",0
"As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency.” “By the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French window of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a good way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot fix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as the gardeners cease work at that time.” “And Mr.",0
"“Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.",0
"The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew. We returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee line for the Anchor Inn. “Here we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,” he explained. “You notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I meant it. But no you observed Mrs. Maltravers’ face when she caught sight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he eh bien, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here on Tuesday night the day before Mr. Maltravers died.",0
"How should I not know you?” “Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.” “You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!” said my friend grandiloquently. “It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.” “We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge. “The injury is serious, then?” I asked. “What injury?” “The bullet wound.” “Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.” “As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed.",0
"At the sight of her son, standing between the two myrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified. “Jack,” she faltered. “Jack, what is this?” He looked up at her, his face set. “They have arrested me, mother.” “What?” She uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait.",0
"""Well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of auburn” “Always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!” murmured Poirot. “But continue.” “Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and well, that’s all, I think,” I concluded lamely. “And her husband?” “Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow nothing startling.” “Dark or fair?” “I don’t know betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of face.” Poirot nodded. “Yes, there are hundreds of these average men and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.",0
"“Let us in, moosior.” “You have our friends safe and sound?” “Yes, we’ve got the birds all right. But they hadn’t got the goods with them.” “I see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with Hastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat.” “For the Lord’s sake, have you gone completely balmy?” “The cat,” declaimed Poirot, “was worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp. To speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I know, considered polite in England.",0
"Moth balls again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt strongly of them. But, then I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking. I explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea. After that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry out a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was watching the doctor examine the body.",0
"He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.",0
"But at last I see clearly.” “You know everything?” “I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.” “And you know the murderer?” “I know one murderer.” “What do you mean?” “We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but two. The first I have solved, the second eh bien, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.",0
"There was clearly nothing to be done until I could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long soothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental over him. In her way which of course is quite different from me and Harry she is really fond of Clarence. “I do wish he was here, Anne,” she gulped. “It’s such a long time since I’ve seen him.” “Have some face cream,” I said soothingly. Suzanne rubbed a little on the tip of her charming nose. “I shall want some more face cream soon too,” she remarked, “and you can only get this kind in Paris.” She sighed.",0
"It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young men with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks. Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things.",0
"It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M.",0
"“They were there when I went down to dinner.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case.” “Who locked up the jewel-case?” “I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.” She held it up as she spoke. The inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders. “The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the jewel-case?” “I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.” “You didn’t lock the drawer?” “No, I never do.",0
"“Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station.” “Oh, no, thank you,” I said hastily. “Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered.” To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!” “What has he done now?” I inquired with some curiosity. “He’s got hold of a secretary for me.",0
"The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed.",0
"Poirot threw me a withering glance. “What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!” he exclaimed sarcastically. “Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf a loaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to bake!” I endeavoured to distract his mind. “Anything interesting come by the post?” Poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air. “I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not exist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were banal to the last degree.",0
"Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely uninteresting. They talked for hours of themselves and their children and of the difficulties of getting good milk for the children and of what they said to the Dairy when the milk wasn’t good. Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of getting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at the Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office had said to them. They never seemed to read the papers or to care about what went on in the world. They disliked travelling everything was so different to England.",0
"Ah, but it was magnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry. So successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from Flat II at that time.” “Except Hercule Poirot, I suppose?” I said sarcastically.",0
"“Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty.",0
"“I am investigating the death of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?” She bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can er throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned to her. “Marthe, dear ” But the girl shook her head. “No, maman, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.",0
"The Star of the East was missing! “That settles it,” I breathed. “These were no ordinary thieves. This one stone was all they wanted.” “But how did the fellow get in?” “Through this door.” “But it’s always locked.” I shook my head. “It’s not locked now. See.” I pulled it open as I spoke. As I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It was a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had been torn from a Chinaman’s robe. “In his haste it caught in the door,” I explained. “Come, hurry. He cannot have gone far as yet.” But in vain we hunted and searched.",0
"The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “Mon Dieu! no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! Eh bien, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.",0
"""But it could not deceive M. Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “You mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable proof. Madame Renauld’s story was false a fabrication from beginning to end. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband yet she lied to shield his murderer. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for herself, usually for the man she loves, always for her children. That is the last the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.” Giraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily. “That is my case,” said Giraud. “What have you to say to it?” “Only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.",0
"He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities. Your name?” “Gabriel Stonor.” “How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?” “About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met him through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering good boss he was too.” “Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?” “Yes, a good bit.",0
"Foscatini sits down, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind Graves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to the service telephone dinner for three! It comes, he lays the table, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to get rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a resolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos, the rice soufflé is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion.",0
"In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “Ma foi! but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.",0
"""And pray, what are they?” “One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last autumn.” “Poirot, you are joking!” “I am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not forget my little commission.” But the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about eleven o’clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read it out: “‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’” “Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!” I stared at him.",0
"Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard which every one would perceive, bien entendu I much prefer that we should voyage together.",0
"“To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.” I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp. “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.” Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply: “Be exact, my friend.",0
"How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully.",0
"This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000. “On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found to contain knobs of sugar! “Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not know. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields was all a fantasy.",0
"I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always something! And I mean to find it.” But Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short discoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched it delicately with his finger. “And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question. Giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor cared.",0
"""I see they did not come by post, these letters.” “No; they were left by hand by a Chinaman. That is what frightens me.” “Why?” “Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought the stone three years ago.” “I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be” “‘The Western Star,’” finished Miss Marvell. “That’s so. At the time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information. Gregory says he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing.",0
"""You may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it, and yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the market when Mrs. Robinson arrived.” “That shows that there must be something wrong about it.” “Mrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious, is it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?” “She was a delightful creature!” “Évidemment! since she renders you incapable of replying to my question. Describe her to me, then.",0
"What had happened to his usually keen wits? “They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.” “Tiens!” cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration. “But your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.” I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.",0
"We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there.",0
"But I shall be able to tell better when I’ve heard the whole story. Now, then, take a deep breath and start again. You went to Florence” “But I didn’t go to Florence. That is just it.” “Well, where did you go, then?” “I went home to Marlow.” “What the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?” “I wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting” “Your wife? But I didn’t know you were married?” “No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived you in this matter.” “How long have you been married?” “Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I became your secretary.",0
"But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M.",0
"""What is that?” “Jack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the golf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once, when they started to dig the bunker.” Giraud laughed out loud. “But it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found! Until it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been unable to enter into his inheritance.” I saw a quick flash of green in Poirot’s eyes as he rose to his feet. “Then why bury it?” he asked softly. “Reflect, Giraud.",0
"A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.” I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied. “So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly.",0
"Then he went on towards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight ‘chink’ which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short search, discovered the ring! That is Kellett’s story. It’s only fair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word of a man like Kellett can’t be relied upon in the slightest. It’s within the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him.” Poirot shook his head. “Very improbable, mon ami. He had no means of disposing of the body. It would have been found by now.",0
"Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here and here ” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have been careful to obliterate them but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?” “Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable.",0
"They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any price, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs.",0
"He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you must have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room her boudoir,” he explained.",0
"Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.",0
"Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one.",0
"It was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves against the wall. I heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. Then he flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear: “Allez.” We sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his arms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless.",0
"“Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.” After bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me. “Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?” “Well, I suppose Ascanio is right somebody impersonated him.” “Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn.",0
"le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Eh bien, speaking frankly in confidence, c’est entendu can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M.",0
"Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe.",0
"But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily.",0
"Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and revised most of Papa’s Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors, Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote ages. I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject, probably not, and in any case he would not have been interested. The opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest degree. I think it was really a sign of his greatness. In the same way, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life.",0
"But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that.",0
"Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them.",0
"“Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not not where” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying. I felt my bona fides was now quite established. “And perhaps I might get it cheap in the circumstances.” A master touch that, I thought. “Well, it’s possible. There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now servants and all that, you know.",0
"Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes.",0
"Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon a young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was employed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing at the same time as the papers.",0
"The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",0
"Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew.",0
"as practically the middle of the day “and I thought that under the circumstances” He tapped the telegram again. “What is that thing?” I asked. “It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been murdered in your house.” That aroused me in earnest. “What colossal cheek,” I exclaimed. “Why in my house? Who murdered her?” “They don’t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once, Sir Eustace?” “You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?” “The police” “What on earth have I to do with the police?” “Well, it was your house.” “That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.",0
"See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they were. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.",0
"Une poignee de main, alors.” I felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down the beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to join them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end.",0
"And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people.",0
"“Well?” I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on all the vital facts. Poirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “Mon pauvre ami! But it is that you have not the gift! The important detail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.” “How?” “Let me take your four points. “One: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could not know beforehand that Mr.",0
"“At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.” Pagett retired. “By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair’s?” “Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur hats, I think.” “That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They are hats of a kind though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them. I dare say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What else was there?” “Some rolls of films and some baskets a lot of baskets” “There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.",0
"I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.",0
"He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over. There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I shrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to materialize from nowhere and took command. I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination.",0
"“Ah, quelle idée! Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Eh bien, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris, and tell me what you make of it!” “I see,” I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot’s remarks bore in upon me. “That letter was written to Jack Renauld not to his father. He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.” Poirot nodded. “Précisement! We can return to this point later.",0
"In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him.",0
"“But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you why was I not told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child ” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs.",0
"“What says the master detective, eh?” asked Hawker, clapping him on the back. “Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.” “You think not?” “What could there be?” “Well, for example, there is the window.” “The window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in that way. I noticed it specially.” “And why were you able to notice it?” The doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain. “It is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd, that. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.” “Well, what of it?” “Very black,” repeated Poirot.",0
"He likes out of-the-way parts of the world.” “No one else goes with you?” Jack flushed. “You mean ?” “A girl who loves you very dearly who has been willing to lay down her life for you.” “How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened, could I go to her and oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?” “Les femmes they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.” “Yes, but I’ve been such a damned fool!” “So have all of us, at one time and another,” observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack’s face had hardened. “There’s something else.",0
"Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.” “Thank you,” I said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “Les Anglais!” he murmured. “No method absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. “Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told me, did you not?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “True, I forgot.” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot.",0
"We’re partners I wouldn’t offer you a penny because I liked you, or because you’re a friendless girl what I want is a thrill, and I’m prepared to pay for it. We’re going into this together regardless of expense. To begin with you’ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we’ll plan out our campaign.” We argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn’t like it. I wanted to do the thing on my own. “That’s settled,” said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching herself with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted with my own eloquence.",0
"” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime.",0
"He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her.",0
"Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her.",0
"” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure.",0
"You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons would be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made.",0
"” He looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair. “I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.” “And to-day?” “To-day I do not know what to think.” Poirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again. “I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.” “Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard.",0
"I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps.",0
"At last he called me: “Come, Anne, it’s time to go.” I got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I knew that dawn was not far off. “We’ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat” Harry began, when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand. “Hush! What’s that?” I listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the wilderness. Presently I heard it too the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.",0
"“You permit that I see whether it matches?” With a cry she started backwards, white to the lips. “It is false I swear it. I know nothing of the crime of either crime. Any one who says I do lies! Ah! mon Dieu, what shall I do?” “Calm yourself, madame,” said Giraud coldly. “No one has accused you as yet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.” “Anything you wish, monsieur.” “Look at the dead man.",0
"I have said nothing all these years, I have been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but now matters are different. I want my price and it will be a big, I might almost say a staggering price.” “Extraordinary,” said the Count. “And doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you everywhere?” His eyes roamed gently round the disordered room. Nadina laughed softly. “You need suppose nothing of the sort. I am not a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will dream of looking for them.",0
"He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me.",0
"Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence, and admitted that the “Russians” were a pure invention on her part. The real murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had committed the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had consented also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime.",0
"At last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with a grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet us. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I’m sorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans.” Poirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush, stayed its course. “Not another death?” he breathed. “Yes.” “Sir Guy Willard?” I cried. “No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.” “And the cause?” demanded Poirot. “Tetanus.” I blanched.",0
"""Pas du tout,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that you, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.” “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung. “Si, si, mon ami, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.",0
"” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? Eh bien, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a cause célèbre unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after ” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind.",0
"It contained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.  (From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Johannesburg,  March 7th. Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at once that we should go off to Pretoria.",0
"“M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you.",0
"""Was there no science then in Ancient Egypt?” asked Poirot softly. He did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment. “No, no, do not answer me, but tell me this. What do the native workmen think?” “I guess,” said Dr. Ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads, natives aren’t going to be far behind. I’ll admit that they’re getting what you might call scared but they’ve no cause to be.” “I wonder,” said Poirot non-committally. Sir Guy leant forward. “Surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in oh, but the thing’s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you think that.",0
"Do you think I want to put frocks on you? I’m a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I’m not going to let you go, do you hear? You’re my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose you. I’m never sure of you. You’re coming with me now to-night and damn everybody.” He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe. “I can’t do without you any longer, Anne. I can’t indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let’s go.” “My toothbrush?” I demurred. “You can buy one. I know I’m a lunatic, but for God’s sake, come!” He stalked off at a furious pace.",0
"""Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here I don’t want to rub it in in any way but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me.",0
"What about food?” “A little starvation will do no harm. The ‘Colonel’ will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely tied up?” The Dutchman laughed. “What do you think?” They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I beat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time the Kafir stirred and moved.",0
"I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.” “Beira,” I said meditatively. “Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to me.” We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at each other. “Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut. I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours.",0
"She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine for all the world as though she’d been running a race and yet Pagett told me that he’d seen her off to Durban last night! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body. And she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, “Secretaries I have had.” No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once. No.",0
"“Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the end his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he scrawled those four desperate words.” But my friend shook his head energetically. “You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?” “Well?” I said puzzled. “Mon Dieu, mon ami, but use your little grey cells! Is it not obvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it carefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last words, and blotted the sheet.",0
"It was clear to me that I must have some kind of standing. I couldn’t go on avoiding explanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay ready to my hand, though I didn’t think of it for some time. The Daily Budget! My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn. He was marked down as “The Man in the Brown Suit” through no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be against him.",0
"His accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now, for, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have been cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.” “Perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?” “Then why did he not do so? He merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing more. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the truth.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the clock, “I suppose we’d better start for the station.",0
"They looked a pair of extremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh and true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive. It was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some clever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and catchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause. Evidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success. Suddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the air. I suggested leaving to Poirot. “Go by all means, mon ami. I amuse myself, and will stay to the end.",0
"I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly.",0
"A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.” “And the Countess?” I inquired with a smile. “Ah! je m’en fiche! Her case was certainly not interesting.” “Why so sure of that?” “Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot wait always remember that, Hastings.” Eleven o’clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover. Before starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed maliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast.",0
"“You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely.",0
"“When shall we start?” “The hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing is likely to occur before then.” At twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot’s manipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed into the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar. “Now we have but to wait,” said Poirot contentedly, closing his eyes. To me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to sleep.",0
"He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that.",0
"Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance. “Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the Anzora to Buenos Ayres. “Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday. “Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are ‘Yes, yes but for God’s sake go now.…’” Poirot paused. “There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do not get new light on the matter.” I endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said.",0
"“You seem to have met your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.” There was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to enter the room. His face lit at the sight of us. “You’re safe, Anne. I was afraid” He turned to Sir Eustace. “I’ve been after you for a long time, Pedler and at last I’ve got you.” “Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,” declared Sir Eustace airily. “These young people have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things.",0
"But, anyway, the valet has most to do with the gentlemen’s rooms.” “I see. Thank you.” Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head. “Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the valet.” I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents. In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same.",0
"There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts, takes him to Merlinville.",0
"""Comment?” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things.",0
"I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud: “. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god.",0
"But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.” I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly. “A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye” He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed.",0
"I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend. “Bien!” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves.",0
"A bad night but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.” “You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health.",0
"Before me, on the rough wooden table, is the letter that Suzanne wrote me. Dear Babes in the Wood Dear Lunatics in Love, I’m not surprised not at all. All the time we’ve been talking Paris and frocks I felt that it wasn’t a bit real that you’d vanish into the blue some day to be married over the tongs in the good old gipsy fashion. But you are a couple of lunatics! This idea of renouncing a vast fortune is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to argue the matter, but I have persuaded him to leave the argument to time. He can administer the estate for Harry and none better.",0
"Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn’t rattle, and plugged it up again.” Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: “I always did hate that blinking giraffe,” he said. “It must have been instinct.” We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue.",0
"Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the result. The minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return. “Curious,” I remarked, at length. “I wonder when they will come back.” Poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said thoughtfully: “They will not come back.” “Why?” “Because, my friend, something has happened.” “What sort of thing? How do you know?” I asked curiously. Poirot smiled. “A few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs. He was much agitated.",0
"To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder me and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend. Sir Eustace’s attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are not in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had a genuinely kindly feeling towards me. Then why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says “because he’s a damned scoundrel,” and seems to think that settles the matter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her, and she put it down to a “fear complex.” Suzanne goes in rather for psycho-analysis.",0
"How they meant to manage the body business originally, I do not know possibly an art student’s skeleton and a fire or something of the kind, but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their hands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the garden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and suddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M. Renauld calls his wife.",0
"You’ve scored over him handsomely.” “That poor Giraud,” said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest. “Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had la mauvaise chance once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for instance. To say the least, it was misleading.” “To tell you the truth, Poirot,” I said slowly, “even now I don’t quite see whose hair was it?” “Madame Renauld’s of course. That is where la mauvaise chance came in. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered.",0
"” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t don’t,” I said fiercely.",0
"“How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered. “But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.",0
"” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M.",0
"She arrived punctually a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour. “My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,” she began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.” “If you please, mademoiselle.” “I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire.",0
"Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the the body?” “Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure? It would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it. Still M. Bex, might I trouble you?” “Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.” “Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested Giraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s body.",0
"Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War.",0
"For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me.",0
"“Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England’s Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention.",0
"I hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he negatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners he was sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he could not have failed to observe them. I do not know what put the idea into my head possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones but I asked suddenly: “Young M. Renauld he did not leave by that train, did he?” “Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour, it would not be amusing, that!” I stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.",0
"“I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’” “Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real.",0
"""Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the body, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I’ve never had a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It’ll last me all my life?” I turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s ghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women were. Now I knew.",0
"The rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out.",0
"“Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?” “Of course I remember.” “I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.” “Was that what you meant?” “Of course.” I hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained. He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: “When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted me. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing.",0
"I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well ” I felt flustered. “I I assumed it.” “Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, mon petit does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No.",0
"Was it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for my benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately “pumped.” For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in? What possible connection could he have with the affair? “Who is Colonel Race?” I asked. “That’s rather a question,” said Suzanne. “He’s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this trip.",0
"He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. Eh bien! I must start again!” Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “Pauvre femme,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door.",0
"He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was Greg’s wedding present to me.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet who knows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.” I complied. “Voyons!” said Poirot, turning the leaves. “When is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in three days’ time. Eh bien, madame, you seek my advice I give it to you. This belle histoire may be a hoax but it may not! Therefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.",0
"“More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that the man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the affair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.” He stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me of being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the thought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of inspecting a miniature revolution at first hand. “No trains are running from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he continued. “But I can arrange to send you over by private car.",0
"He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain. He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles. After a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames.",0
"What kept her there the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas en route to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the Anzora had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain.",0
"The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.” The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher. The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below. “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.” I craned my neck over the staircase. “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper.",0
"You go along and get on with your work.” The chambermaid went unwillingly. “Going to search her?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine. “Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key. Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her. The inspector’s face grew graver. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room.",0
"” Poirot paused, and then added softly: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.” “Mrs. Robinson!” I gasped. “Well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended Poirot. “Also, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, mon ami, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below armed with that excellent revolver of yours, bien entendu!” “Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm.",0
"Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel my passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do. You’ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps.” At that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped forward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction. “Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black.” A few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited the fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn.",0
"""Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?” “Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.” “Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I ” I hesitated. “I want to meet your sister.” We both laughed. “That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy we’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey, especially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed first thing is quite true. I’m not your kind. And that brings trouble I know that well enough.…” Her face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out of it.",0
"""Yes?” “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.” “And the chauffeur?” “The chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.” “So,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the Prime Minister in France, and O’Murphy in London.",0
"Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot so and I say: the Prime Minister is there! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.” And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener.",0
"Also I wanted to ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received?” Lady Yardly shook her head regretfully. “I’m afraid I don’t. It is stupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them seriously.” “You’ll stay the night?” said Lord Yardly. “Oh, milord, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at the inn.” “That’s all right.” Lord Yardly had his cue. “We’ll send down for them. No, no no trouble, I assure you.",0
"""I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said.",0
"The man in the corner raised a meek voice. “Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?” The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough. “Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don’t be offended. You’ve asked questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.” I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall. “You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?” “Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened.",0
"He was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange beard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself. I was in the hands of the enemy. It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.” How often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It’s all very well on the screen you have the comfortable knowledge that there’s bound to be an Episode IV.",0
"Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down like that.",0
"He was tramping along the road to Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village, ‘dark-complexioned gent, with a big moustache, one of them city toffs,’ is his description of the man. “Kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just before he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down the road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge.",0
"The Flemmings took in the Daily Budget, and the Daily Budget was having a day after its own heart. EXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT. WOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station.",0
"The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.” “Pardon, how was it paid?” “In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.” “Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?” “In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with the man.” “And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?” “I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.” Poirot looked at him and shook his head.",0
"“That was a very interesting story you told us last night,” I said, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always interested in diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.” “And what happened to him eventually, I mean. Does any one know?” Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions.",0
"You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What beau temps, is it not? Good day, milord.” And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands. “Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?” “No, mon ami, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.” “How did you get the diamond.” “From Mr. Rolf.” “Rolf?” “Mais oui! The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in Society Gossip, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike bah! they did not exist.",0
"“And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the haute noblesse of the criminal world!” I laughed. “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?” The landlady interrupted us. “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.",0
"Well, I must wish you good night, Monsieur Poirot, unless” He hesitated. “I perceive the thought in your mind,” said Poirot, smiling. “I shall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get hold of a taxi.” Taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon bowling along in the direction of Regent’s Park. Regent’s Court was a new block of flats, situated just off St. John’s Wood Road. They had only recently been built, and contained the latest service devices. There was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell impatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply. “Flat II.",0
"“I? Never! What a game!” He became excited. “Figure to yourself, each hole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged mathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is only one pleasing thing the how do you call them? tee boxes! They, at least, are symmetrical.” I could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to Poirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no malice. Then he asked: “But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?” “Yes, he was a keen golfer.",0
"""And I don’t know that I’m so comfortably married either,” continued Suzanne in a melancholy voice. “I’ve been having the most dreadful cables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once. At last I didn’t answer them, and now I haven’t heard for over a fortnight.” I’m afraid I didn’t take Suzanne’s matrimonial troubles very seriously. She will be able to get round Clarence all right when the times comes. I turned the conversation to the subject of the diamonds. Suzanne looked at me with a dropped jaw. “I must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect Colonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds.",0
"The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios. His name was Ned perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue.",0
"I will rejoin you later.” It was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders.",0
"""I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.” “Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, n’est-ce pas? What it is to be young! O jeunesse, jeunesse!” And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.",0
"“Assuring you once more that the matter is urgent, “Yours faithfully “P. T. RENAULD.” Below the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “For God’s sake, come!” I handed the letter back with quickened pulses. “At last!” I said. “Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.” “Yes, indeed,” said Poirot meditatively. “You will go of course,” I continued. Poirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his mind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave. “See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty of time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion.",0
"""What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.",0
"Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably.",0
"I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution.",0
"Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true.",0
"You know Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a house there!” But with an incoherent muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled. That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett.",0
"There will be no great danger in Jo’burg.” The women immediately looked at him in the “What a brave hero you are” manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as Race but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it all their own way. “I suppose you’ll be there,” I said coldly. “Very possibly. We might travel together.” “I’m not sure that I shan’t stay on at the Falls a bit,” I answered non-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo’burg? He’s got his eye on Anne, I believe. “What are your plans, Miss Anne?” “That depends,” she replied demurely, copying me.",0
"You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” “I shall manage,” I said airily. “Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o’clock train to-morrow, Wednesday, morning,” Pagett continued.",0
"“And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary.",0
"So we are forced to the second that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “Bien! Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but ” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love.” I shook my head perplexed. “Mais, oui, you know perfectly.",0
"It ran as follows: “The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came.” The second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the third was more explicit: “You have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will be taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is written.” “The first letter I treated as a joke,” explained Miss Marvell. “When I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came yesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might be more serious than I had imagined.",0
"Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband’s financial débâcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that the young soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that was last night!’ she observes.",0
"“Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables” “Oh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed. “Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters and er guides.” “Exactly,” I hastened to reply.",0
"""For the Lord’s sake, tell us, then!” Poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate, placed them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat effect, and then beamed affectionately on us both. “Come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the question which I asked myself. ‘If I were this man, where should I hide?’ Hastings, what do you say?” “Well,” I said, “I’m rather inclined to think I’d not do a bolt at all. I’d stay in London in the heart of things, travel by tubes and buses; ten to one I’d never be recognized.",0
"” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture and in connection with some case. I rather fancy ” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!” We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation.",0
"She had got in with a bad lot, he told me and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story.",0
"However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. “Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld. They both addressed Colonel Race. “I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?” I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time. Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so on. Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject.",0
"He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with empressement. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible.",0
"” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “Ça commence!” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “Mon ami, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I ” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing sergent de ville. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.",0
"At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find! I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking.",0
"“I shut my eyes and think.” Japp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.” “And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?” “Certainly. That’s in the bargain.” “Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. “Like robbing a child!” I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room. “Eh bien!” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?” He shook his finger at me.",0
"“Why?” “Monsieur has not heard the news, though?” “What news?” “That there has been another murder there last night!” “What?” Leaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could. Another murder and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise. “What has happened?” “Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?” She crossed herself.",0
"“Épatant!” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first water.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?” His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it. “I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to see.",0
"Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.” “O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?” “Yes, he is an Irishman.” “From what part of Ireland?” “County Clare, I believe.” “Tiens! But proceed, milord.” “The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual.",0
"The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story. “You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly.",0
") Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.",0
My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship.,0
"“When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” “When I began to work the right way from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a mind like mine!” The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received.",0
"""Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I’m an actress. No not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six tumbling.” “I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled. “Haven’t you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I understand.” “I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now ” “We?” “My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in.",0
"The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.",0
"Then I saw.… “You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening?” “But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the 11:40.” My brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant anxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime.",0
"I may as well tell you in confidence, Sir Eustace that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by the secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady. Where and how did you come to engage her?” “She was lent to me,” I replied coldly, “by your own Government.” He collapsed utterly. (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) As soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne. She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off en route.",0
"It was right up on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages and villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. “Mrs. Raffini?” I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me. A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. “So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said.",0
"Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs.",0
"Have you ever seen him before?” Drawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face, Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity. Then she shook her head. “I do not know him.” It seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head. “You are letting her go?” I asked in a low voice. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her head.” “I do not need teaching my business,” said Giraud dryly. “She is under surveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.",0
"After a moment or two, I said rather doubtfully: “As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.” “Blackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character and habits.” “Mrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,” I argued. “We have already seen that Madame Renauld’s testimony cannot be relied upon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.” “Still, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.” “None whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?” “The letter, Poirot.",0
"Owing to the fact that an itinerary of the great man’s daily proceedings had just been published, I knew exactly where to find him at this moment. It was his hour for dictating to his secretary in his own house. I did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to come and ask for him would be at once admitted to the august presence. But I had attended to that side of the matter. In the card-tray in the hall of the Flemmings’ house I had observed the card of the Marquis of Loamsley, England’s most famous sporting peer. I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs, and pencilled upon it the words: “Please give Miss Beddingfeld a few moments of your time.",0
"""Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate ” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it.",0
"He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl.",0
"I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement.",0
"I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up.",0
"Secondly, the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly, as he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of Lowen.” Japp nodded. “I don’t say you’re not right. But all the same, you won’t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird’s evidence. What seems odd to me is that Lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",0
"I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands.",0
"” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly.",0
"Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall. I looked round me and then caught my breath with a gasp.",0
"They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of about forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four. Count Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man paused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted that, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed immediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on.",0
"“All goes well? But do not tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in your lake, because I shall not believe you.” “We haven’t found the body, but we did find his clothes the identical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to that?” “Any other clothes missing from the house?” “No, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his wardrobe is intact. There’s more. We’ve arrested Lowen. One of the maids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares that she saw Lowen coming towards the study through the rose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten minutes before he left the house.",0
"I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the “scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to let presumably was still to let.",0
"It’s mainly owing to him, and to his large subscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a say in the designing of it.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. Then he remarked: “It was not a very good choice they made of a spot to bury the body? When the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been discovered.” “Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that proves that they were strangers to the place. It’s an excellent piece of indirect evidence.” “Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body there unless unless they wanted it to be discovered.",0
"He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.” “No question of his having been shot, eh?” “My dear sir!” “I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!” “You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr.",0
"About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold. “Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered. “Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy.” Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.",0
"For the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with M. Renauld père, and pass to the next chronological event.” “May 23rd,” I read, “M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don’t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.” “We agree, mon ami at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M.",0
"But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock something would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time.",0
"""Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain Hastings.” Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. “Sent for you, did he?” “You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?” interposed M. Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about.",0
"What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him. On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent Bridge players and one decent-looking woman Mrs. Clarence Blair.",0
"” The doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the examining magistrate. “A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.” “And so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “Could it possibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among themselves.” Giraud shook his head. “The man is a Frenchman I would take my oath of that ” But at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression.",0
"It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never read the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all did, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.",0
"It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow. We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed. Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper.",0
"You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “Eh bien, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d hounds to the hounds.",0
"“What the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly. “I want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.” “There’s no doctor here.” The man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in adroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated Frenchman. “What you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You must come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.” “My dear sir” The door was opened again, the man, clad in a dressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with an uneasy glance round. “I will call the police.” Poirot prepared to descend the steps. “No, don’t do that for Heaven’s sake!” The man dashed after him.",0
"“You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room.",0
"“It seems strange to you, mon ami, that a man should plan his own death? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you he did not intend to die.” I shook my head, bewildered. “But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told you, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a different angle. “Georges Conneau flies from justice to Canada.",0
"That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes.…” His voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start.” “You’ve oceans of time.” “Perhaps perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.” “At all events,” I said, rising, “I will come and see you off.” “You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.” He was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded emphatically. “I mean it, mon ami. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it is not the English custom.",0
"She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much.",0
"Schneider to-day.’ And a bit more of the same. Young Bleibner lit out for Cairo right away.” “Was he in perfectly good health at the time?” “The old man?” “No, the young one.” “I believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But it couldn’t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.” “One thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?” “So far as we know, he has not.” “Are you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?” “No, sir, I am not. I’m for New York as soon as I can square up things here.",0
"""What?” “Imitation, mon ami.” The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!” “Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm. “Where?” “We must tell the Opalsens at once.” “I think not.” “But that poor woman” “Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.” “But the thief may escape with them!” “As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs.",0
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to the sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish, hiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre décors. In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It was the Manager.",0
"” A slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied constrainedly: “I’m afraid that’s impossible.” “You have it with you hein?” Poirot was watching her narrowly. The girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward, unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely set in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly. Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss. “Épatant!” he murmured.",0
"“Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.",0
"“I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping that is the great thing.",0
"""It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, mon ami?” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! Sapristi! But it is miracles you ask from me. No say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “Dear M.",0
"“What was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?” “We’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large transaction having been just carried through. There was also a small fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim’s jewels were kept in the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem.” “Altogether a good haul,” said Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!” “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!” “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.” “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.” “Mon Dieu! but how you enrage yourself for nothing, mon ami!” “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door.",0
"He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “Eh ma foi! and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle. “You would have had Maître Grosíer’s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on.” “He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he worried me horribly. You see, I couldn’t very well take him into my confidence.",0
"Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man, with slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand. “Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished speaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?” Poirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.",0
"I would be a prospective tenant. I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers.",0
"Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back.",0
"“In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!” He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a how do you call it? ‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.” I laughed.",0
"” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s me Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it.",0
"""Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?” “No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.” “There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?” “I would not even attempt to do such a thing.” “You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle?” “That is exactly how I look upon it.” “It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"What could one do with a man like that? “Of course, if it’s so dreadful that you’d be ashamed to speak of it to me” I began spitefully. At last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed. “Dreadful? Ashamed? I don’t understand you.” “Then tell me.” In three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett’s secret! It was not in the least what I expected. I walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me. I tore it open.",0
"“There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace made his money!” “Suspecting him again?” “Suzanne, I’ve got into that state that I can’t help suspecting somebody! I don’t really suspect him but, after all, he is Pagett’s employer, and he did own the Mill House.",0
"That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly ” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot.",0
"It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The mal de mer it is horrible suffering!” “Oh!” I said, rather taken aback. The first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and closed his eyes. “Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to study it?” Poirot shook his head impatiently. “But no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the stomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer. You breathe in and out slowly, so turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath.” I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.",0
"“It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I observed sarcastically. He considered for a minute. “Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed. It was a curious way of putting it. “Very well,” I said for the third time.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the more it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody else is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements and positively rejoicing in the storm.",0
"Pagett is staying behind here you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia which is very annoying, because I want to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural.",0
"Of course I am a poor man, and my uncle was a rich one in other words, he paid the piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on.",0
"I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say ‘Go!’” “Go!” I said. With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning. “Well, mon ami?” he demanded of me breathlessly. “Forty-six seconds,” I replied. “You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.",0
"By common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that the Count’s mannerisms had dropped from him, could doubt that it was his native language. He had, indeed, started life as a quick-change music-hall artiste in London. “You had a great success to-night,” he remarked. “I congratulate you.” “All the same,” said the woman, “I am disturbed. My position is not what it was. The suspicions aroused during the War have never died down. I am continually watched and spied upon.” “But no charge of espionage was ever brought against you?” “Our chief lays his plans too carefully for that.” “Long life to the ‘Colonel,’” said the Count, smiling.",0
"“It is queer, isn’t it? You don’t think that that the place is haunted?” “Never heard of a haunted flat,” declared Parker decisively. “N-o.” Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. “But there were several things about it all that struck me as well, queer.” “For instance” I suggested. “Ah,” said Parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused! Unburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries.” I laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle thrust upon me.",0
"Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?” “Oh!” I said, bewildered. “Exactly,” said Poirot, beaming. “We start again.” He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience.",0
"The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed to die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully I crept down the stairs.",0
"“I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds.",0
"At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly. With an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at my friend. “Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about this. It’s from Hoffberg. He thinks he’s found a customer for the diamond an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They’re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if this goes through” Words failed him. Lady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her hand.",0
"His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with Mr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the house where?” Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg. He frowned.",0
"They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my er experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself.",0
"Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age. Aha! a note from Japp.” “Yes?” pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case. “He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted to have been of service to him.” “How does he thank you?” I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp. “He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.",0
"It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly.",0
"“Pardon, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.",0
"“Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You in company with a friend visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th” The Italian made an angry gesture. “I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court” “Précisément and I have a little idea that you have sworn falsely.” “You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.” “Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you but with publicity.",0
"Us had signed one” “What time of day was that?” Baker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker. “Why, to be sure, I’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven. Don’t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen.” “And afterwards?” “’Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. ‘I’ve made a mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. I’ll trouble you to sign again,’ and us did. And afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each.",0
"“You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to find one soon, or it’s a washout.” “One more question, permettez Lady Yardly, which plan does she approve?” “Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel.",0
"Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection. “Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.",0
"We will dismiss the thin air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore” “Yes, but we know” “You may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since it seemed incredible, it was incredible. Two possibilities remain: it was hidden on board also rather difficult or it was thrown overboard.” “With a cork on it, do you mean?” “Without a cork.” I stared. “But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been sold in New York.",0
"""Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?” The man looked up at him and started. “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours. The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.” “What about the jewel-case?” I asked. “It was found in a corridor of the hotel.",0
"""But why? What are you waiting for?” “For the Olympia. She is due on her return trip from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.” “To a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, mon ami, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I wait eh bien to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is perfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly gifted by the good God the Inspector McNeil, for instance it would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself.",0
"In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter. “I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried. Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I most disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was decidedly pretty.… “There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx.",0
"""Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes.",0
"It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you ” “I know I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still ” I began, and stopped. “Still as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing.",0
"” Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket. “It is now a quarter to nine.” “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully. “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur it may come in useful. Now for the details the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?” “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.",0
"“But what is there in him that attracts you so? I don’t see that there’s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good looks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.” I poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes. “Just because you’re comfortably married and getting fat, you’ve forgotten that there’s any such thing as romance,” I ended. “Oh, I’m not getting fat, Anne. All the worry I’ve had about you lately must have worn me to a shred.” “You look particularly well nourished,” I said coldly. “I should say you must have put on about half a stone.",0
"His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do. I don’t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise. There’s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you’re a sensible young woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him” “I won’t do anything of the kind.",0
"Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me.",0
"“It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute.",0
"” I shuddered. Then a thought struck me. “You say you didn’t know I was there. What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he did not seem to notice. “How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?” I asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. “And what are you doing in this part of the world, anyway?” “I live here,” he said simply. “On this island?” “Yes, I came here after the War.",0
"You can guess, I dare say. But I’ll tell you this I’ll clear my name, or die in the attempt, and I’ll choke the life out of the damned scoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.” “We must be fair,” I said. “He didn’t actually push me over.” “He’d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge.",0
"""Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren’t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?” I demanded irritably. “I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.” Trust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it! “Well?” “I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir Eustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I thought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked about him. He slunk up the stairs by the saloon. I followed him.",0
"""Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock.",0
"""What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question.",0
"No, Anne, don’t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down here. Joking apart, I think you’ve made a very important discovery. Up till now, we’ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we know he hasn’t.” “Exactly,” I said. “We must keep an eye on him.” “As well as everybody else,” she said ruefully. “Well, that’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. That and finance. No, don’t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you’ve got to listen to horse sense over this.",0
"Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.” “Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?” “So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.” “Well, let us pass from that.” “Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?” “I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.",0
"“And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er the Madonna er Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So picturesque on the banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered.",0
"Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself.",0
"And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.",0
"""Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together?” “I don’t quite understand you?” “I will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?” The doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment. “You’re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you’ve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk?” “Absolute nonsense,” muttered Willard angrily. Poirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his green cat’s eyes. “So you do not believe it, monsieur le docteur?” “No, sir, I do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “I am a scientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.",0
"Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour slightly to my annoyance. I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon: “It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a garde-malad.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had occurred.",0
"“The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.",0
"” Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily. “It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he remarked lugubriously. I don’t see why it should have and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily. Again I believe he is right.",0
"“Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not last night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.",0
I felt my temper stirred. “Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.” “Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his pocket. A lot of other people may have had too only they didn’t happen to be killed.” I rallied my forces. “You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?” “Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.” “And no money.,0
"What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute.",0
"How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town.",0
"But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act but I could not rest easy in my mind.",0
"The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American. Throughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.",0
"You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction.",0
"Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.” I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question.",0
"""Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden.",0
"""What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body. I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.” “Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.” “I beg your pardon, my friend one can always be mistaken. Regard a great actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs.",0
"What frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us some one he recognized.” “You didn’t see any one?” “No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.” “Nothing unusual in that,” said the inspector dryly. “But he wasn’t a doctor.” “What?” “He wasn’t a doctor,” I repeated. “How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?” “It’s difficult to say, exactly. I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies.",0
"""You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired.",0
"In an upper room of the Mill House the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday, strangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not been identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.” Nobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited the following facts. Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House.",0
"Only one thing had been taken ‘the Western Star.’” We stared at each other the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal. Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?” “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf. “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?” “Certainly.” In about five minutes Poirot reappeared. “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.” “Who to?” “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine.",0
"Giraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said: “That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the interrogatory, M. le juge.” “Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your quarrel?” “I decline to state.” M. Hautet sat up in his chair. “M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered. “What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But another voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I will inform you, if you like, M.",0
"“What is it?” “The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?” “No, I didn’t.” “You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore false to all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I asked, not particularly interested in Poirot’s principles.",0
"And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.",0
"Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks alias the Rev. Edward Chichester alias Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: “I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me.",0
"But the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher would take that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms, makes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen containing his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be thoroughly welcome to his money.",0
"He has only just recovered.” “Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw ruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.” Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past.",0
"“Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.” There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks. “You know?” she gasped. “How?” I smiled. “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters” “Miss Marvell? She has been here?” “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same.",0
"""Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that.",0
"When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep.",0
"“I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I.",0
"The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death ” Poirot interrupted with a quick question.",0
"We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud. Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them.",0
"""You are sure of that?” “I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?” “Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?” Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated apologetically.",0
"Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?” “Oh, I don’t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I think.” “Thank you.” Poirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “With your permission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told us all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your subconscious self.",0
"On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely. It was rather a knotty problem. “We’ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,” I said. “And it’s not too late for morning tea,” said Suzanne. “We’ll have it in the lounge.” The Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated “eleven-o’clock tea.",0
"""But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.",0
"In the pitch darkness of the night, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned reluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police. Lady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a woman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story. “I was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a man sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with such force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him disappearing through the side door.",0
"Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal paymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run no risk of the hangman’s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their affair.” “Then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?” Poirot made a gesture of anger.",0
"He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir larger.",0
"I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this time!) I murmured: “Kilmorden Castle?” “On the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?” “How much is it?” “First class, eighty-seven pounds” I interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly the amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket. “First class,” I said. I was now definitely committed to the adventure.  (Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.) It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace. I am a man who likes a quiet life.",0
"” We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face blanched noticeably. “You,” she gasped. “I thought you were on the sea on your way to East Africa?” “I got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the young man. “My old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money.",0
"It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran: “In time.” Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression. Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival.",0
"Witnessed by the two servants, Denise and Françoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it back. “Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice ” “The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago. Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his amorous intrigues.” “Yes,” said M.",0
"""Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?” “Several times, I believe.” “He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him?” “Never.” “Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there?” “No.” “Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?” “Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there was a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.",0
"“We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “My dearest one:” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid.",0
"""There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! Eh bien! it comes to this are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him.",0
"Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but ma foi! I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing.",0
"Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur.",0
"I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.",0
"There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No and there ought to have been. Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon.",0
"There’s a sort of deft professional callousness that this man hadn’t got. Besides, a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.” “He did that?” “Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time except that I felt there was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.” “H’m,” said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and paper. “In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.” “Doesn’t sound likely to me,” said the inspector.",0
"""And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue a psychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice.",0
"Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah.",0
"And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on her it would be very surprising! Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, Célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily. “If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie!” she declared heatedly. “I never so much as saw them.” “Search her!” screamed the other. “You will find it is as I say.” “You’re a liar do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon her.",0
"” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion.",0
"But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head.",0
"We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?” “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.” “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.",0
"""Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.",0
"” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled. I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was. “That man? Oh, that’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary. Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before.",0
"The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible but nothing has been discovered!” At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.” The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew. “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C.",0
"I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so.",0
"” I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home orphans without consulting me first. “We will send her a wire from the station,” continued the lawyer. My few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat sadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a “Mary” hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out but doesn’t! A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim.",0
"Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell. He merely called to Marchaud: “You have got the other there?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Bring her in then.” “The other” was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with vehemence. “I object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to do with all this?” “Madame,” said Giraud brutally, “I am investigating not one murder, but two murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.” “How dare you?” she cried. “How dare you insult me by such a wild accusation! It is infamous.” “Infamous, is it? What about this?” Stooping, he again detached the hair, and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He advanced towards her.",0
"Whatever grudge there might have been would have been on Mr. Davenheim’s side.” “Well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the study?” “No. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man’s clothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual, he would have done better to speak the truth.” “And the fourth point?” “I grant you that. If Kellett’s story is true, Lowen is undeniably implicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.” “Then I did appreciate one vital fact?” “Perhaps but you have entirely overlooked the two most important points, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter.",0
"""He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal.",0
"By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle, which left Cape Town in two days’ time. I had just time to journey down and catch the same boat. “I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board.",0
"The house and furniture had been sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts. As yet, I had not been successful in finding a post. Not that I really wanted one! I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to be proved in practice. It was early in January the 8th, to be exact. I was returning from an unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a secretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman who would work twelve hours a day for £25 a year.",0
"Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so.",0
"I myself had been the first sufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head muffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions. His eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece. “Yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “Once more shall I be myself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers! Figure to yourself, mon ami, that I have a little paragraph to myself in Society Gossip.",0
"Renauld’s youth and upbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?” “All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.” “What is it, my friend?” “Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!” “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot placidly, “that is just what he did do!” In a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition.",0
"The detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion. “You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about the case. Let’s hear your views.” “One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M. Giraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there nothing it reminds you of?” “Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so, though.” “You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember but I shall do so.",0
"I took her hands in both of mine. My eyes said the rest. Poirot cleared his throat. “Mes enfants,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “Très bien, mon enfant,” said Poirot.",0
"“This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk. “Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.” Poirot laughed. “The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘Tiens! The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back.",0
"Poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words: “Key of Roll Top Desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys. “An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is also a young lady of method and order.” Baker came in answer to the bell. “Will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?” Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs.",0
"… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad.",0
"There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love.” “Eh eh! The sentimentality,” warned Poirot. “Where one hates one also loves,” I quoted or misquoted. “At any rate he finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old wrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave.",0
"But what a lot of things have happened since then especially for you, mon ami!” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning.",0
"Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station.",0
"He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale.",0
"""I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves that sort of thing.” “If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.” “I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.” “Ah, that reminds me what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a secretary?” And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly.",0
"“You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?” “I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad. “Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate. “After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly realized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last.",0
"But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily. “Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person you are.” Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. “I must report myself to my chief,” I said demurely. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office middle compartment dictating at an incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.” “This enthusiasm for work is something new,” I commented. “H’m!” said Colonel Race.",0
"You remember the De Beer diamonds?” “Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I had nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case was hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.” “A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked it under the ‘Colonel’s’ orders, of course. And it was then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time.",0
"Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective.",0
"Immediately, with an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang from her chair towards him. “There now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do. It was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I’ve a feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.” “Calm yourself, I pray of you, madame.” Poirot patted her hand soothingly. “Reassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot will aid you!” Mr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector.",0
"I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain.",0
"“Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?” “Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!” “And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?” “Certainly they did.",0
"""And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall.",0
"""If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly.",0
"But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day! Impossible to please him!” The sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity. “And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.” “One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “Quelle idée,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the salon. It is cool there on this hot morning.",0
"What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?” “I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.” “By threats eh? You seriously advance that supposition?” “Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter’s marriage.” “You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the whip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.",0
"Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen? Would he have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so providentially upon the scene?” “Then you think he may be entirely innocent?” “It looks like it, but, if so, we’ve got to find out what he was doing in Marlow. If he’s got a reasonable explanation of that, we’re on the right tack.” He got up. “It’s past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before dawn I’ll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at Livingstone. I’ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away until the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira train there.",0
"“That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot.",0
"""That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.",0
"“I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed.",0
"I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. “All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?” It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it.",0
"Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “Précisément and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.",0
"They passed to Europe” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood.",0
"In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order.",0
"We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike.",0
"My original idea was to stay a couple of days or so at the Falls which I’ve never seen, though this is my third visit to Africa and then go on to Jo’burg and study the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I pose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all I hear, Jo’burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit in about a week’s time. I don’t want to study conditions in the midst of a raging revolution.” Race smiled in a rather superior manner. “I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace.",0
"In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have £50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams.",0
"Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P.",0
"“You think so? Eh bien, I agree with you,” said Poirot. He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “Mon Dieu! But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, mon ami. At last I am on the right track. I am still in the dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.",0
"""But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.” “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door.",0
"I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings.",0
"It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right especially with the help of this.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella.",0
"My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.",0
"""Good Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I’d give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself just for once. You’re so confoundedly conceited!” “Do not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there are times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties of greatness!” The little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that I was forced to laugh. Tuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicions or certainties.",0
"Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?” I leaned back, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction. Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “I think that you should write for the Kinema, mon ami,” he remarked at last. “You mean ?” “It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me there but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.” “I admit that I haven’t gone into all the details, but ” “You have gone further you have ignored them magnificently.",0
"And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. Maman will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “Mon ami,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she is beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned.",0
"“In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we get what?” “Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.” “Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.” “I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed. “You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll test his alibi?” “Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.” “You think he has an alibi?” “That is just what worries me.",0
"There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls! This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness.",0
"It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them something in the nature of joss-stick that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?” I shook my head. “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.” “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.” We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery.",0
"Poirot. I just love jewellery. Ed knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me something new. You are interested in precious stones?” “I have had a good deal to do with them one time and another, madame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world.” He went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with bated breath. “There now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “If it isn’t just like a play! You know, I’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them.",0
"“I must go up to her at once.” “But no, I tell you. It is better not.” “But Marthe and I ” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s arm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was weeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs.",0
"Monsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a stout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his charming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in which Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although doing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The Beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with. But unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of Romance.",0
"""You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply.",0
"We must investigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.” In about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn. Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged. “I have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us here,” he explained. “You can understand, monsieur le capitaine, that I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers’ state of mind immediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not wish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.",0
"John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds. “But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute. Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart. He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago.",0
"Even to Pagett. I happened to hear that he or rather Mrs. Pagett had brought a sixth child into the world the other day. England will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the child a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness to act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post card straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face! Bless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you have made in not marrying me. Yours ever, Eustace Pedler. Harry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not see eye to eye.",0
"Renauld will don the tramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave, unnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him. “You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella. Every moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon as he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression that the assassins left that way.",0
"Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room must have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn up, and scattered on the floor. This morning ” But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell. Françoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove of course! What else? With a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her.",0
"True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment. “On Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light. Behind a portière in Mr. Davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that safe had been broken into and rifled.",0
"The girl’s clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she’s ferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house. She was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a deduction quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather that she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have these intuitions I’ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess but to call it a deduction is absurd. How she ever got on the staff of the Daily Budget is more than I can imagine.",0
"""How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed.",0
"""Psychoanalysis, what?” said Black, with visible alarm. “Oh, no,” said Poirot reassuringly. “You see, it is like this, I give you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the first one you think of. Shall we begin?” “All right,” said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy. “Note down the words, please, Hastings,” said Poirot. Then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him. “We will commence. Day.” There was a moment’s pause, and then Black replied: “Night.” As Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.",0
"An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend. His eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to the uttermost. “I have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.” Major Norman moved hastily to the door. “I’ll order the car.” “There is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has fallen.” “Do you mean you are going to walk, sir?” “No, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea by boat.” “To cross the sea?” “Yes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And the beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return to England.",0
"In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case. I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker’s special hobby.",0
"""How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?” “I should say so maybe.” “He was clean-shaven, you say?” “Yes, miss not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.” “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it was. However did you know?” “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.” “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?” “Just the ordinary kind, miss.",0
"“Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again.",0
"” The case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb of Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomb a belief which, as Poirot pointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought. “Poirot,” I said, “a change of air would do you good.” “You think so, mon ami?” “I am sure of it.” “Eh eh?” said my friend, smiling. “It is all arranged, then?” “You will come?” “Where do you propose to take me?” “Brighton.",0
"” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds. All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client. Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking, with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child. Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once. “You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice.",0
"’ Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched. Wisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be dangerous? he retires gracefully with an enormous fortune!” “H’m!” said the Count doubtfully. “It is rather upsetting for all of us. We are at a loose end, as it were.” “But we are being paid off on a most generous scale!” Something, some undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her sharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity.",0
"Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.” And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar.",0
"But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “Maman,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth.",0
"It seems that all along she’s been on the track of “The Man in the Brown Suit.” Apparently she didn’t spot him on the Kilmorden_ in fact, she hardly had the chance, but she’s now very busy cabling home: “How I journeyed out with the Murderer,” and inventing highly fictitious stories of “What he said to me,” etc. I know how these things are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me. And of course one of Nasby’s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won’t recognize himself.",0
"My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation.",0
"""Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?” “No, not one.” “Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to tetanus?” “Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.” “Then we have four deaths all totally dissimilar, one heart failure, one blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.",0
"Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne.” A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him covered with the revolver. “So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up.",0
"Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more ” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M.",0
"According to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour to-day and would be almost on time, though he was extremely doubtful whether it would ever get through to Johannesburg. The line had been blown up, so he solemnly assured me. It sounded cheerful! The train drew in just ten minutes late. Everybody tumbled out on the platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no difficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his usual nervous start at seeing me somewhat accentuated this time. “Dear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.",0
"” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.",0
"” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M.",0
"I see everything now.” “If that is indeed the truth, I congratulate you, mon ami. For as a rule you are not famous for seeing eh, is it not so?” I felt a little annoyed. “Come now, don’t rub it in. You’ve been so confoundedly mysterious all along with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might fail to see what you were driving at.” Poirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then he looked up. “And since you see everything now, mon ami, what exactly is it that you see?” “Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld.",0
"Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared the woman. “Cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.” Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms. “Two?” said Poirot sharply. “Yes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil one and sure enough, so he did do.",0
"He persuaded me to come over to his side.” Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. “Rats always leaving a sinking ship,” observed Sir Eustace. “I don’t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they’re in the big giraffe’s stomach.",0
"Jewels, ready money, bearer bonds all so conveniently arranged for whom? Well, the good Monsieur Davenheim was of those who ‘look after Number One’ as your saying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged for himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery! How simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put away in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track.",0
"A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way. “There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming genially. “Eh bien, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.” “Bella Duveen.",0
"After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh. Their employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh’s orders. They remembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs, they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised.",0
"There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.” “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?” “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.” “And the real Prime Minister?” “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs.",0
"“There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble. There is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives have been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents which throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import them. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean ‘detonators,’ cauliflower, ‘rifles,’ other vegetables stand for various explosives.” “That’s very interesting,” I commended.",0
"""Impossible!” “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.",0
"And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this I added to my report.",0
"” Then she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter.",0
"” This was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly. “A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah ” I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me. “This is out of the ordinary, mon ami. Read for yourself.",0
"Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I could not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to him, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do.",0
"He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite.",0
"By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a desperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted that I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions and failed!” “What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle.",0
"He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself it’s something about the eyes.” “I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.",0
"""Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.” “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?” “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.” “You would be doing the Government a great service a very great service. You would not find them er ungrateful.” “Meaning, you want me to be the postman?” “Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is bona fide. Everything would be eminently satisfactory.” “Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.",0
"Tried the front way in, but that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn’t taking any. I guess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in one wouldn’t cut ice with him! It’s a real piece of luck happening on you this way. Come on, show me all the sights.” “But look here wait a minute I can’t. Nobody’s allowed in. They’re awfully strict.” “Aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?” I was loath to relinquish my position of importance. “Why are you so keen?” I asked weakly. “And what is it you want to see.",0
"Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy. “But it is misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. “Aqua calda certainly ought to be cold water not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair.",0
"I’ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts. They’re beauties too, Anne and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me.",0
"""If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.” “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same who accompanied him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?” Lord Estair smiled.",0
"Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that all alone. You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.” “Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy.",0
"But I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so. “Tiens! A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this charming young lady?” I had to confess that I did not know. “Still more romantic! The first rencontre in the train from Paris, the second here. Journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the saying?” “Don’t be an ass, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!” “It’s all very well to rag me.",0
"But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr.",0
"Also, by this ” And, leaning forward, he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see. It was a woman’s long black hair similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. Eh bien, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud.",0
"Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?” “But how on earth could you know all that?” “I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the little grey cells! They told me. Thus, and in no other way, could there have been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. Poirot listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious.",0
"“Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered.",0
"But I would give a considerable sum of money for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of whisky with him when he arrives to-morrow? I put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs. The curio-shops in Jo’burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying a window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the shop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race. I can’t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on his accompanying me back to the hotel.",0
"Count Foscatini. There’s been an accident there, I understand.” The man stared at him. “First I’ve heard of it. Mr. Graves that’s Count Foscatini’s man went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.” “Is the Count alone in the flat?” “No, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.” “What are they like?” I asked eagerly. We were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on which Flat II was situated. “I didn’t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were foreign gentlemen.” He pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing. No. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell.",0
"“Mon Dieu! But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when ” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.” “You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then ” “Eh bien?” “Well, we are hunting together again, and ” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, mon ami, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil.",0
"I have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point.” The Daily Newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events. Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed.",0
"It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House.",0
"” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil.",0
"I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door.",0
"We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.",0
"She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious whirl and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me.",0
"Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment I had a two-berth one to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the train would start. But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well.",0
"He looked at me. “You’ve made a mistake, I think,” he said, smiling. “Oh, no,” I said. “I’m sure I haven’t.” “You’ve given me the wrong roll. This is an unexposed one.” I walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is good for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be! But nobody relishes the process. And then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices, I came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of one of the company’s boats, and it was labelled “Kenilworth Castle.” A wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went in.",0
"""Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony.",0
"” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.",0
"Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise !” he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. “Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and ” “You will not have to send far, M. le juge.” The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window.",0
"” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him.",0
"“Oh, do tell us!” Race smiled. “Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so it was reported, had returned from that part of South America bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some of them of considerable size.",0
"He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch.",0
"In feature, little to take hold of, a man difficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of account. He bowed over the dancer’s hand with exaggerated courtliness. “Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.” So much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind her. Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina’s smile. “Compatriots though we are, we will not speak Russian, I think,” she observed. “Since we neither of us know a word of the language, it might be as well,” agreed her guest.",0
"The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. “What?” I cried, startled. Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the street. Pagett had followed him. “And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!” “What?” “Yes, Sir Eustace. And that’s not all. I’ve been making inquiries about her” “Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?” “He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop” I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly. “Nothing,” I said. “Go on.",0
"He came out furious from the interview his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me.",0
"I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity ” “Well, then ” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice ” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life.",0
"In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin.",0
"A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. “Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.",0
"“Voilà! Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The sergent de ville saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me.",0
"It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling.",0
"I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?” I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs.",0
"“What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M.",0
"I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight. It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that’s extra beautiful. I’m not very good at expressing these things, but I knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment, the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsly.",0
"Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn. “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate very delicate.” “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.” He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. “My dear Pedler! The common post!” It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’ Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents.",0
"He is the sort of man who never notices legs himself or, if he does, would die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way, you’d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for me.” “Surely you will not go in fancy dress?” said Pagett, in tones of horror. I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained.",0
"I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited.",0
"Then a voice behind me made me start: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m just going down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I said hastily. “But there’s no need to trouble you. I” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.” I was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said coldly. We all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. “I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he observed.",0
"“If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started” “My dear fellow,” I interrupted brutally, “that was a bilious attack. You’re always having bilious attacks.” Pagett winced slightly. “It wasn’t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time “For God’s sake, don’t go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don’t want to hear them.” “Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!” “Ah!” I said. “You’ve been talking to Rayburn.” He did not deny it.",0
"""I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The ‘Colonel’ is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.” “I am not afraid of him,” she laughed. “There is only one man I have ever feared and he is dead.” The man looked at her curiously. “Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,” he remarked lightly. “What do you mean?” cried the dancer sharply. The Count looked slightly surprised. “I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,” he explained. “A foolish joke.” She gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war.",0
"There was no reply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang again and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no sign of life rewarded us. “This is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. He turned to the lift attendant. “Is there any pass-key to this door?” “There is one in the porter’s office downstairs.” “Get it, then, and, look here, I think you’d better send for the police.” Poirot approved with a nod of the head. The man returned shortly; with him came the manager. “Will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?” “Certainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying.",0
"“You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and what is more send his son there?” “It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.” Poirot shook his head.",0
"Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was going this afternoon.” To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so! “Enough of this,” he said harshly, rising. “What are you going to do with me?” I asked, still endeavouring to appear composed. “Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you.” For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me.",0
"There’s safety in a crowd.” Poirot turned inquiringly to Japp. “I don’t agree. Get clear away at once that’s the only chance. I would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I’d have a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I’d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began!” We both looked at Poirot. “What do you say, monsieur?” For a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted across his face.",0
"And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate.",0
"What did you mean by that?” The two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said: “You have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied Conference?” My friend nodded. “For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow Thursday evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity.",0
"Perhaps these are the missing ones or perhaps” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but what was his name? Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.",0
"When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.",0
"“Paris!” “Suzanne,” I said, “very soon you’ll have had enough of South Africa and adventure.” “I should like a really nice hat,” admitted Suzanne wistfully. “Shall I come with you to meet Guy Pagett to-morrow?” “I prefer to go alone. He’d be shyer speaking before two of us.” So it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel on the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol that refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit.",0
"But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.",0
"‘Implicated in the most thrilling mystery please send me a thousand pounds at once Suzanne.’” I took the form from her, and pointed out that she could eliminate a “the,” an “a,” and possibly, if she didn’t care about being polite, a “please.” Suzanne, however, appears to be perfectly reckless in money matters. Instead of attending to my economical suggestions, she added three words more: “enjoying myself hugely.” Suzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the hotel about eleven o’clock to fetch her. I was left to my own devices.",0
"’ That will intrigue him, the good Japp! His eyes will open wide wide! He will not comprehend in the slightest until to-morrow, or the next day!” I remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend’s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank. Before we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and Japp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was Poirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of my friend.",0
"My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to the lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite window.",0
"Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle_ that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the devil Carton hid them if he did hide them, I don’t know.",0
"I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped. To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.",0
"By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death ‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.” “That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.” “I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.",0
"Seeing as he was in a great to-do and with all that quite the gentleman I brought up ’is card.” She handed me the bit of pasteboard. “Mr. Roger Havering,” I read. Poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently pulled forth “Who’s Who.” Poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly. “Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb.” “H’m!” I said. “I rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at the Frivolity only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember she married some young man about town just before the War.",0
"“I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I I excuse me” He bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly.",0
"But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack.",0
"” Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture. We lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to present itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed maliciously: “Eh bien! And your indiscretions! You recount them not?” I felt myself blushing. “Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance.",0
"“Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers for which I shall be hauled over the coals and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town. It’s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as he was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.” I paused for breath. “You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I spoke.” “What? Pagett?” I cried, in lively astonishment.",0
"“All this is very well in its way, but we must get to business. Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all.",0
"""Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror.",0
"I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method” “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted.",0
"""Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment. “Madame Daubreuil from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur.",0
"That’s what makes it so wonderful.” “Wonderful is the word! It’s a blinking miracle. But there must be a catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?” “No premium!” “No prem oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned Parker. “But we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued Mrs. Robinson. “Ah!” Parker brisked up. “I knew there was a catch!” “For fifty pounds. And it’s beautifully furnished!” “I give it up,” said Parker. “The present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy.” Mrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker appeared between her dainty brows.",0
"Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory.",0
"” The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her. In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner. “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.",0
"It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look at the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will realize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives. He knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over, vengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me to the real Mrs. Robinson that delightful and truthful creature! What will they think when they find their flat has been broken into! We must hurry back.",0
"I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air. “Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “Parbleu! to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me.",0
"My idea was to go at once to the Magnificent, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly. In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them. I gave way unwillingly.",0
"I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it.",0
"“What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her.",0
"” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair.",0
"” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were never traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die down, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. The trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and beauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to make of it a cause célèbre. People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm.",0
"Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.",0
"That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.",0
"“Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.” “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.” “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail.",0
"Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience.",0
"As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put me on to a very good thing, and well, I have money to burn, as the saying goes. I think a week-end at the Grand Metropolitan would do us all the good in the world.” “Thank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.” I did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.",0
"Davenheim would be absent posting a letter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!” “He might have seized his opportunity,” I suggested. “And the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s tools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with a penknife, bien entendu!” “Well, what about Number Two?” “You say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better of it is more likely to be the other way about.",0
"So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear. We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M.",0
"There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race and his people. You didn’t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race.",0
"le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as ?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions.",0
"” Poirot nodded. “Then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in the kitchen. You permit that I mount there?” “Oh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you up and introduce you; but I’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s of any use. They’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and they’ll be all lumped together.” Poirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II. “The order was given from the à la carte menu for three,” he explained.",0
"There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! “My God, Poirot!” I cried. “Look at her hand, her right hand. It’s all red!” Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. “Blood,” she cried hysterically. “Yes, it’s blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he’s come back!” Her voice died away in a gurgle. “Lights,” said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic.",0
"“He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, jeune homme?” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said. I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him.",0
"On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil! ve confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions.",0
"But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared. The police are looking for her.” “Was she in with her daughter, do you think?” “We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.” “Has Jack Renauld been told?” “Not yet.” “It will be a terrible shock to him.” “Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.",0
"In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me I know what happens in a case of that kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters of law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms.",0
"“And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s have your deductions, Hastings.” “‘Obvious, my dear Watson,’” I quoted lightly. “She went to the wrong flat.” “Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” cried Mrs. Robinson admiringly. I rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities. The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities. “A curious story,” he said thoughtfully.",0
"Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack ma foi! they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his train. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall.",0
"You say no one else was near enough to see what happened?” “I had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can’t be sure and, anyway, they wouldn’t be as near as I was.” The inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure. The deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been found in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel.",0
"I was on the staff of the Daily Budget, and I had a private word of congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that it was he best so for the present. We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail.",0
"She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “Please there’s a dear.” I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me.",0
"‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was perfect, the indulgent tone, the soupçon of sad mockery. At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great woman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!” Poirot lost himself in contemplation. “One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?” “You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be unrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track.",0
"It was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out. We came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in our tour. I found him studying the centre table with close attention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany table. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but the three dessert plates were untouched. There were three coffee-cups with remains of coffee in them two black, one with milk.",0
"” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot.",0
"""Mon ami, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one measuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all important clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping having nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told you so. No” as I was about to interpose a question “we will say no more. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems straightforward enough and yet and yet, mon ami, I am not satisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two hours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in.",0
"There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here.",0
"""I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already serious.” “A little fasting will improve my figure,” I said, with a sigh. We were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it with amazement: “Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.” I don’t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne. There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young woman she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She has an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don’t see why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the middle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no train, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel’s wings and flown there.",0
"“Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay.",0
"“Good. Wait awhile.” About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat. “C’est ça. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.” “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily. Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift. “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us.",0
"Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about something. “He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost. I thought he was taken ill.” On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the upstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as that of “Mrs. de Castina.",0
"The time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough to leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let me go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long moody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by himself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple meal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was sinking. Hairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been able to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my knees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation.",0
"Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert. “A wonderful place,” I said aloud, “and a wonderful work. I can feel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel the charm?” I got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was quickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude couch, his face horribly convulsed.",0
"“But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.” “Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.” Mr. Chichester did not reply. “Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally. “To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.",0
"And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark Anzora sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.",0
"When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening.",0
"“The Chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “The Chinaman the side door.” Lord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart beating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry. There, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace, evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I swooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord Yardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.",0
"For instance, if the object of the murderers was revenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him. Poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air. “Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably some distance away, since they wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.",0
"I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I sprang up. Harry was on the stoep outside. “Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.” I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing.",0
"A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again.",0
"Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face. He was thoroughly taken aback. What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room.",0
"As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed.",0
"“Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.",0
"I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the middle of the cabin. A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it under the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other hand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it was supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from her trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be suspected of harbouring a fugitive.",0
"The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the crime passionnel is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.” “But what about the crime passionnel? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head.",0
"She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will.",0
"She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that it is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand, Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could. All this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne’s full approval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a psychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards).",0
"""Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?” I told her something about Papa’s life work. “So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t a mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls?” “I may,” I said cautiously. “I’ve got other plans as well.” “What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning. Didn’t you sleep well? I can’t keep awake on board a boat. Ten hours’ sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!” She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten.",0
"Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! Un moment, s’il vous plaît.” I joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly startled, came running up to the hedge at his call. “A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?” “Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.” Despite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid. “Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast.",0
"But why did you go to Marlow?” “It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances yes, I still feel natural under the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I cried desperately. For the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me. “I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I fail to see your concern in the matter.” He was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt desperate.",0
"As to your question, I’m sure I don’t know.” “You could find out?” asked Poirot with curious persistence. “Oh, certainly if you really want to know.” “Merci, mon ami. I should be obliged if you would make a point of it.” Japp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have forgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and murmuring, “Poor old fellow! War’s been too much for him!” gently withdrew from the room. As Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper, and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend’s voice aroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk and alert.",0
"The Riviera was all right, of course, because one met all one’s friends there. I listened and contained myself with difficulty. Most of these women were rich. The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to wander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London and talked about milkmen and servants! I think now, looking back, that I was perhaps a shade intolerant. But they were stupid stupid even at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily inadequate and muddled housekeeping accounts. My affairs did not progress very fast.",0
"The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing.",0
"You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man or with himself in a figurative sense might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.” “But not you, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at me. “He couldn’t baffle you, eh, Monsieur Poirot?” Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.",0
"""Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.” “And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired.",0
"The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.” Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?” “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.” “And the Conference is to be held?” “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.",0
"Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked men, the ‘secret,’ the papers!” Poirot smiled a little. “Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably. But reflect now on something very curious.",0
"“This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried.",0
"But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections.",0
"I can alter my appearance a little wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window.",0
"M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil the dagger! Jack Renauld had three souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans.",0
"It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still roll. Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.",0
"Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on.",0
"We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your father? A very interesting man on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them.",0
"“I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking ” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening.",0
"Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead. A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime.",0
"Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports.",0
"… She had loved him! Could she let her hand be the one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but she was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her. However that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day. Madame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was acquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau was never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her. Taking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life. I have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here.",0
"Because, after all, honeymoons don’t last forever you’re not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a little wild-cat Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but one day you will suddenly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane, sumptuous furs, Paris frocks, the largest thing in motors and the latest thing in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses! Oh, yes, you will! But have your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and let it be a long one.",0
"The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient greffier sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I I told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed.",0
"I can’t help feeling responsible for his death. It will haunt me for ever!” “No, no,” I said soothingly. “Of course it’s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,” resumed Jack, “but I’d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and realized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so honestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself.",0
"I turned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an interest in his story. “Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me.",0
"He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly. I, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm. “I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late if you go yourself.” Poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two. “Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram.” At that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the Flying Corps. “This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France.",0
"Are you better tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it’s all about?” “I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.” “Why not?” I said, chagrined. He smiled nastily. “If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.” “Don’t you think I could keep a secret?” “I don’t think I know.” He rose to his feet. “At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events of this evening.” “I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently. “How dare you?” I cried angrily.",0
"She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost it’s what she must have thought me at first all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.",0
"When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after me! I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since. He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.",0
"""I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.” He looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up flushed and excited. “God help me, so you are,” he muttered, and went abruptly out. My recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most serious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be actually broken. A careful examination, however, convinced him that it was not so, and although it was very painful I was recovering the use of it quite quickly. It was a strange time.",0
"“I was.” As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. “You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?” “M. Poirot has gone to Paris,” I replied coldly. “And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.” “Bah! The English police!” Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. “They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better.",0
"The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice.",0
"Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All seemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will. Here it is.” Poirot ran through the document. “So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor who is he, by the way?” “M. Renauld’s secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once or twice for a week-end.” “And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise. Simply drawn up, but perfectly legal.",0
"You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her.",0
"Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room.",0
"“Allow me to introduce Captain Lucien Bex, a dear friend from England,” Poirot gestured. The commissary and I exchanged nods before Bex redirected his attention to Poirot. “It has been quite some time, my old friend. Last I saw you was in Ostend back in 1909. I heard you had left the Force?” Poirot confirmed, “Indeed, I now operate a private business in London.” Bex inquired, “You mentioned having information that could be of help to us?” Poirot responded, “It is possible you are already aware. Did you know the victim had summoned me?” Bex was taken aback, “No, by whose request?” Poirot explained, “The deceased. He had foreseen an attempt on his life. Regrettably, he reached out to me too late.” The commissary interjected, “Sacri tonnerre!”",1
"I struck up a conversation with Mr. Chichester, hoping to glean some information. He mentioned his time in Africa, but I couldn't help but notice his lack of sunburn. As he fumbled with a piece of paper, claiming it was part of a sermon, my suspicions grew. Later, during a conversation about Italy, Mr. Pagett seemed uneasy and quickly excused himself. Sir Eustace joked about his secretary possibly committing a dark deed in Florence. Despite his respectable appearance, the idea lingered in the air. As the group dispersed, Mr. Chichester's clumsy action caught my attention once again. Colonel Race then approached me, commenting on my elusive nature at the previous night's dance. We discussed plans for the evening, hinting at a dance together.",1
"Speeding away from London in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, Havering explained the situation to Captain Hastings. Hunter’s Lodge, where the tragedy occurred, was a small shooting-box in the Derbyshire moors. Havering's real home was near Newmarket, renting a flat in town during the season. The lodge was managed by a housekeeper, with servants brought down during the shooting season. Havering's uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace, had lived with them for three years. The uncle had suggested a trip to Derbyshire, but was found murdered the night before. Japp from Scotland Yard was on the case, meeting Havering and Hastings at the small grey stone building on the moors. Japp had questions for Havering before heading back to the village.",1
"""We never considered that possibility."" ""Like I mentioned,"" M. Hautet continued, ""initially the case appeared straightforward, but the presence of the masked intruders and the mysterious letter from M. Renauld have added layers of complexity. It seems we are now dealing with a completely separate set of circumstances, seemingly unrelated. In regards to the letter addressed to you, is it plausible that it had any connection to this 'Bella' and her menacing intentions?"" Poirot dismissed the idea with a shake of his head. ""Highly unlikely. A man of M. Renauld's caliber, someone who has experienced life's dangers in far-flung corners of the world, would not seek protection from a woman."" The examining magistrate vigorously nodded in agreement.",1
"As Giraud laid his hat on the table and prepared to deliver his lecture on detective work, Poirot settled in to listen attentively. Giraud confidently outlined his case against Jack Renauld, detailing the motives and means that led to his arrest. But Poirot, with a glint of mischief in his eye, interjected with a crucial detail that Giraud had overlooked. The two men engaged in a battle of wits, each trying to outsmart the other with their theories and deductions. As they walked towards the sea to review the case, Poirot guided Hastings towards the truth with his characteristic cryptic remarks. It was a challenging and exhilarating intellectual exercise, where every detail mattered, and every clue led them closer to unraveling the mystery.",1
"As the clock struck midnight, I found myself driving back to town, leaving my wife and uncle behind. Upon my return, a telegram was placed in my hand. It read: ""Uncle Harrington murdered last night. Bring a skilled detective. Hurry, Zoe."" With uncertainty clouding my mind, I made my way to Elmer's Dale, a desolate place surrounded by moors. The Scotland Yard inspector, Japp, greeted me with a grin, ready to share his findings. The housekeeper recounted the events of the night before, detailing the arrival of a mysterious man with a black beard. Mrs. Havering, a striking figure in her flame-colored attire, was eager to cooperate, her vivacious personality shining through the tragedy. The puzzle was set, and I was determined to unravel it.",1
"I observed the paleness of her face beneath the makeup, and detected the fear in her trembling voice. It was then that the pieces fell into place, revealing why Poirot was on her trail and the depths of her apprehension. Moreover, it was in that instant that the truth about my own feelings became clear. ""Yes,"" I responded softly. ""Is he after me?"" she questioned in a hushed tone. After a brief pause from me, she sank to the floor beside the large armchair, overcome with intense, sorrowful sobs. I lowered myself beside her, enfolding her in my embrace and tenderly brushing the hair away from her tear-streaked face. ""Please don't weep, my dear, don't weep. You're safe here. I'll protect you. Please don't cry, my love. Everything is known.""",1
"“Always stay vigilant for danger,” Mr. Rayburn warned me, his voice filled with urgency. “And remember, if you ever find yourself in their grasp, honesty may be your only salvation.”His words sent a shiver down my spine. “Your caution is unsettling, Mr. Rayburn,” I admitted, my heart racing with unease. “But why go to such lengths to protect me?”Mr. Rayburn fell silent, his expression grave. After a moment, he spoke softly, almost as if to himself: “This may be the final favor I can offer. Once ashore, I will be safe, but reaching land is not guaranteed.”“What do you mean?” I exclaimed, my mind reeling with the implications. “Are you suggesting that my knowledge of your identity as 'The Man in the Brown Suit' puts us both in jeopardy?”",1
"The doorbell rang, prompting Jeanne to answer it. She returned holding a card. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer lazily reached for the card, but upon reading the name “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a spark of interest ignited in her eyes. “I will see him. Jeanne, fetch the maize peignoir quickly. And when the Count arrives, you may leave.” “Of course, Madame.” Jeanne brought the peignoir, a delicate blend of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, smiling to herself as she sat down, tapping a slow rhythm on the dressing-table with one long white hand. The Count wasted no time in taking advantage of the invitation extended to him - a man of average height, slender, graceful, pallid, and remarkably fatigued.",1
"""She lowered her gaze, seemingly filled with shame, and whispered in a trembling voice: “You can't, you can't... not if you knew.” Then, with sudden determination, she looked me straight in the eye and demanded: “What do you know?” “I know you visited Mr. Renauld that evening. He offered you a check which you tore up in a fit of rage. After that, you left the premises.” I hesitated. “What happened next?” “I'm not sure if you were expecting Jack Renauld to arrive that night, or if you simply lingered in the hopes of seeing him, but linger you did. Perhaps you were feeling lost and wandered aimlessly, but regardless, just before midnight, you were still in the vicinity and spotted a figure on the golf course.” Once more, I fell silent.""",1
"""It would greatly annoy me if anyone dared to make a fool of you."" ""Understood. But I feel obliged to inform you "" ""I am well aware of everything. You are my adversary! So be it. It doesn't bother me in the slightest."" ""As long as it's all fair and transparent, I have no objections."" ""You possess the quintessential English love for 'fair-play!' Now that your moral concerns have been met, let us leave without delay. Time is of the essence. Our time in England has been brief yet adequate. I have uncovered what I sought to discover."" The tone was nonchalant, yet I detected a hidden threat in the statement. ""However "" I started, then fell silent. ""Nevertheless, as you wish! Undoubtedly, you are content with the role you are performing.""",1
"As Ned greeted Harry and the dripping female, he provided them with food, hot coffee, and dry clothes. Meanwhile, he discreetly inquired about Sir Eustace's party at the hotel. Anne firmly refused to go to Beira, fearing for her safety now that her enemies knew she was alive. Instead, she planned to join Suzanne and wait for further instructions. The diamonds were to be stored in the Bank under the name of Parker. To avoid deception, any genuine messages from Harry would have the word 'and' crossed out, and wires signed 'Andy.' Despite the chaos, Anne jokingly asked Harry about marrying someone else, to which he threatened to wring the other man's neck. Anne teased Harry about his unpredictability, highlighting their playful banter.",1
"I was relieved to receive a telegram informing me that Anne was safe in Kimberley with Suzanne Blair. Anne had always been a resilient woman, much like a terrier with a knack for turning up smiling. The news of her safety brought me comfort, but I couldn't help but wonder why she had chosen to leave the hotel in the middle of the night to get to Kimberley. Did she sprout wings and fly there? It seemed unlikely, but with Anne, anything was possible. Her mysterious ways always left me guessing, a common theme in my life. As a crime novelist, I was accustomed to uncovering secrets and solving mysteries, but with Anne, the answers never came easy. It was a puzzle I may never solve, adding to the intrigue of our complicated relationship.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, with everyone fast asleep. As we stood beneath Mrs. Renauld's open window, a cry for help shattered the stillness. A light flickered in a nearby room as a struggle ensued. Poirot sprang into action, scaling a tree with feline agility. I followed, watching as Cinderella, the acrobat, swung effortlessly towards the danger. In a daring rescue, she averted a tragedy just in time. The scene unfolded, revealing the sinister truth behind the murder of M. Renauld and the attempted murder of his wife. The pieces fell into place, leading us to the unexpected culprit, Marthe Daubreuil. Through a series of clever deductions, the mystery was unraveled, exposing the cold-blooded motives of a calculating killer.",1
"There was no hint as to the identity of the thief who had stolen the million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds from the London and Scottish Bank on board the Olympia. Miss Esmée Farquhar, engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway, sought the help of Hercule Poirot to unravel the mystery. Ridgeway, visibly distressed, recounted the events leading up to the theft. The bonds, sealed in his presence by the joint general managers of the bank, vanished from his locked portmanteau on the voyage to New York. Poirot, intrigued by the case, agreed to assist and suggested lunch at the 'Cheshire Cheese' to discuss the matter further. The young couple, along with Captain Hastings, joined Poirot for lunch, eager to uncover the truth behind the disappearance.",1
"""The revolver found at Ealing was not the murder weapon used on Mr. Pace,"" Poirot stated confidently. ""Roger Havering, with the help of his wife, carefully orchestrated a plan to mislead the police and divert attention away from Derbyshire. Mrs. Havering shot Mr. Pace after dinner, reloaded the revolver, and cunningly placed it back in its original spot. Their plan was meticulously executed, leading to the unfortunate passing of Mr. Pace and the Havering couple in the Air Mail crash to Paris. Despite Japp's efforts, justice was not served in the end, as the murderers got away with Mr. Pace's fortune. The world of crime is full of twists and turns, my friend,"" Poirot mused, as we pondered the dark realities of deception and greed.",1
"Jack barely caught his train in Paris after rushing from the library to retrieve his forgotten bag. Out of breath and angry, his face flushed with color, he narrowly made it in time. A dispute that left him fuming was overheard, but the details were lost in the chaos of yelling voices. Poirot, unruffled by the commotion, chose to wait in the cool salon for the return of the examining magistrate. Meanwhile, I decided to investigate on my own and stumbled upon Cinderella, who was unexpectedly nosing around the crime scene. Her morbid curiosity about the murder at the Villa Geneviève both intrigued and repulsed me. I couldn't help but wonder what the world was coming to, with women like her seeking thrills from such gruesome events.",1
"Poirot and I sat on the grassy knoll, overlooking the sea, reviewing the case. The bathers' cries reached us faintly, the sea pale blue in the calm. Poirot encouraged me to arrange my ideas methodically. Madame Daubreuil's connection with the Beroldy Case was key. I had a sudden epiphany about Georges Conneau. Poirot embraced me warmly, impressed. I theorized that Conneau, driven by old grievances, had killed Renauld. Madame Daubreuil was involved, and Jack Renauld had been manipulated. Poirot appreciated the story but pointed out the lack of realism in my reconstruction. I defended my theory, suggesting Conneau had obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil. Poirot disagreed, questioning the plausibility of my supposition.",1
"Poirot was perplexed as he tried to unravel the mystery surrounding M. Renauld's murder. The commissary and magistrate were discussing the conflicting testimonies of Françoise and Denise, while Poirot examined a worn letter found in the pocket of the dead man's overcoat. The letter, written in English, contained threats from a woman named Bella, indicating a love triangle that may have led to the crime. Poirot noted that the stab in the back was likely done by a man, adding a new layer of complexity to the case. The magistrate suggested reaching out to authorities in Santiago to uncover more about M. Renauld's past. As they delved deeper into the investigation, Poirot remained focused on finding the true motive behind the murder.",1
"Mrs. Renauld descended the stairs, supported by Léonie, her head bandaged. The French girl pleaded with her to return to bed, fearing for her well-being. Mrs. Renauld, however, pushed forward, disowning Jack and accusing him of his father's death. Jack, shocked and confused, was helped to the Villa Marguerite where he was attended to by a doctor. Poirot and I, hungry and tired, secured rooms at the Hôtel des Bains for the night. There, we met Miss Robinson, who had a mysterious task for Poirot. Despite her insistence on joining us, we set out on a night mission to the Villa Geneviève. On our way back, we checked on Jack's condition at the Villa Marguerite, where we encountered Madame Daubreuil and observed Jack's troubled sleep.",1
"Poirot listened intently as Marthe revealed a shocking revelation. She described a confrontation between M. Renauld and a tramp in the garden, hinting that they might be the same person. Poirot pondered over the implications of her story, considering the possibility that Jack Renauld might have murdered his own father for money. As they made their way back to the Villa, Poirot's mind raced with new suspicions and clues. Suddenly, a car pulled up outside with Giraud, Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes. Poirot hastily searched through Jack Renauld's belongings, finding a crucial piece of evidence hidden among ties and handkerchiefs. With a triumphant cry, he pocketed the item and hurriedly left the room before Giraud could interfere.",1
"There was a sudden rap at the door, and before I could even utter a word of acknowledgement, it swung open. I was taken aback by the unexpected visitor. My mind raced with images of Mr. Pagett wielding a gun, or my missionary acquaintance armed with a sandbag. However, what stood before me was a night stewardess, her face displaying curiosity and an air of respectability. ""Excuse me, miss, I thought I heard you call out,"" she remarked. ""No,"" I replied firmly. ""I did not."" ""I apologize for the intrusion."" ""It's quite alright,"" I reassured her. ""I couldn't sleep. A wash seemed like a good idea."" The words felt unfamiliar, as if self-care was a rare occurrence for me. ""I'm sorry, miss,"" the stewardess repeated, her tone apologetic.",1
"""Given the timing of the crime, suspicion cannot be cast on him. His annoyance at the unexpected visit from Bella is evident, but he quickly gets rid of her. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, rectifying his past mistake. The night is cold as he buries the dead man, leaving clues against himself. His plan unravels when justice catches up to him. The unraveling of the case has been both perplexing and baffling. Poirot's brilliance shines through as he outwits his rivals. Madame Renauld's silent suffering reveals her strength as she protects her son's secret. The lead piping was used to disguise the victim's identity, a clue that led Poirot in the right direction. Now, the focus shifts to finding out who truly killed M. Renauld.""",1
"I caught my breath at the sight before me, a hunger for the unknown swelling inside. The Kilmorden drew closer, like a dream. Another figure appeared, familiar yet distant after the events of the previous night. His warning of danger lingered, leaving me unsettled. As we parted ways, his footsteps echoing, I knew our paths would not cross again. The next hours were a blur of bureaucracy and relief, until I found myself at the Mount Nelson, surrounded by sunshine and flowers. Suzanne's indifference contrasted with my excitement, but I reveled in the beauty around me. This is not a story of South Africa, with no promise of local color. My inability to provide italics of authenticity is clear, but the essence of the tale remains.",1
"Blair was obsessed with capturing unique photographs as we journeyed higher and higher up the mountain. She insisted on snapping shots of the train's front from the back, claiming it would look dangerously thrilling against the mountain backdrop. Anne Beddingfeld expressed relief at traveling during daylight, marveling at the magnificent scenery. Colonel Race informed her that they only had three trains a week to Rhodesia, leading to a discussion about their plans at the Falls and Johannesburg. Race's assurance about the safety of Jo'burg prompted a skeptical response from Sir Eustace, who suspected Race had ulterior motives involving Anne. The dynamic between the characters hinted at underlying tensions and unspoken desires.",1
"I had informed the stewardess of my cold and insensitivity to smells. She appeared distressed, but I stood my ground. The evening dragged on, and I retired to bed, ready for any emergency. Vague thoughts crossed my mind, but I was certain that something would happen at one o’clock. The cabin was filled with silence as my fellow passengers settled in for the night. Suddenly, my door burst open, and a panicked man stumbled inside, pleading for help. With only seconds to spare, I swiftly concealed him behind my trunk and washed basin, transforming my appearance into that of a lady preparing for bed. When the door opened again, I was surprised to find a night stewardess standing there, looking for the source of the earlier noise.",1
"In the hallway, Giraud stood facing his captive. ""Good afternoon, M. Giraud,"" Poirot greeted. Giraud pointed towards Jack. ""He tried to escape, but I caught him. He's being held for his father's murder."" Poirot turned to Jack, who stood against the wall, pale and silent. ""What do you have to say for yourself?"" Jack remained silent. I was shocked. I had hoped for a denial, but Jack's silence was damning. Poirot questioned Giraud's reasons for the arrest. As they entered the salon, Giraud boasted about his detective skills. Poirot listened attentively, then pointed out a flaw in Giraud's theory. Intrigued, I followed Poirot out of the room. As they emerged, Mrs. Renauld appeared on the stairs, shocked to see her son in custody.",1
"With a cry of terror piercing the night, the girl vanished through the window, her wrists like steel. Poirot, impatient, brushed Françoise aside and hurried down the passage to the other maids. The door was locked from the inside, but a heavy fall was heard. Eventually, Cinderella opened the door to reveal Mrs. Renauld gasping for breath on the bed. She had been nearly strangled. Poirot examined a silk rope ladder - a means of escape. Meanwhile, a figure lay dead on the ground, revealed to be the beautiful Marthe Daubreuil. Confused memories flooded my mind as Poirot reprimanded Françoise for not disclosing Mrs. Renauld's change of room. The chaos culminated in Poirot demanding the doctor for Mrs. Renauld and then the police.",1
"""Dear Hastings, I am in need of a new residence and have set my sights on Montagu Mansions. There is an air of intrigue surrounding that place, mark my words."" Luckily, luck was on our side. Apartment No. 8, located on the fourth floor, was available for rent at the price of ten guineas per week. Without hesitation, Poirot secured it for a month. As we stepped back onto the bustling street, he dismissed my objections with a wave of his hand: ""I am doing well financially, my friend. Why not treat myself to a little luxury? And speaking of which, Hastings, do you happen to possess a revolver?"" ""I believe I do, somewhere,"" I replied, feeling a shiver of excitement. ""Do you anticipate"" ""Needing it? It is a distinct possibility.""",1
"I heard the sound of running feet in the passage. Suddenly, a man burst into my cabin, pleading for help. With quick thinking, I hid him behind my cabin trunk and wash-basin, disguising myself as a lady preparing to wash. A night stewardess interrupted, warning of a drunk man causing trouble. After bandaging the wounded man's stab wound, he refused my help coldly. I felt a sense of danger from him, especially when he refused to thank me for saving his life. The next morning, I discovered someone had searched my cabin. Determined to uncover the truth, I kept a close eye on Sir Eustace Pedler, Mr. Pagett, and the Rev. Edward Chichester. The mysterious events on the ship continued, raising suspicions about the people around me.",1
"I recited the numbers as they appeared before me. “1 71 22.” “Look,” Suzanne pointed out, “it’s similar, but not quite. It’s still one o’clock, and the 22nd, but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” Our eyes locked, thrilled by our revelation and consumed by anticipation as if we had unraveled the entire enigma. Then reality hit me hard. “But, Suzanne, nothing significant occurred here at one o’clock on the 22nd.” Her expression mirrored disappointment. “No, nothing did.” Another thought crossed my mind. “This isn’t the cabin you originally reserved, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you were initially assigned?” “No, the purser switched me to it.” “I wonder if it was pre-booked before departure for someone who never showed up.”",1
"Poirot and Hastings were deep in discussion, trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the murder of Mr. Renauld. As they debated various theories, Poirot suddenly paused and looked at Hastings with a glint in his eye. ""I have it,"" he exclaimed. ""The answer lies not in the open door, but in the closed window."" Hastings was taken aback by this revelation. ""The window?"" he asked, puzzled. ""Yes, the window,"" Poirot replied, his mind racing with possibilities. ""It is clear to me now that the murderer did not leave through the door, but through the window. That is where we will find our answers."" With a newfound determination, Poirot and Hastings set out to investigate the window, knowing that it held the key to solving the case.",1
"""It is him, over there."" He gestured to a man stepping out of the shadows. To my shock, it was the Prime Minister himself. Eager to unravel the mystery, I pressed Poirot for answers as we drove back to London. The story unfolded - the Prime Minister had been kidnapped on his way to London, not smuggled back as I had assumed. The details of the abduction were revealed, involving a clever plan orchestrated by Captain Daniels. The Prime Minister's double was convincingly portrayed, shielded from anyone who knew him well. As we crossed into France, the deception unraveled, leading to the Prime Minister's disappearance. The man who played the part of the Prime Minister discarded his disguise, leaving behind a trail of confusion.",1
"""It's undeniable that the letters arrived via post, yet there's a peculiar scent lingering on them, reminiscent of joss-sticks that immediately evoked the East in my mind. What could be the significance of it all?"" I pondered. My companion shook his head in bewilderment. ""That is precisely what we need to uncover. Do you still have the letters in your possession? Perhaps the postmarks hold a clue."" His response was disheartening. ""Regrettably, I disposed of them. You see, back then I perceived it as a mere jest. Is it conceivable that a Chinese syndicate is genuinely pursuing the diamonds? It sounds preposterous."" Despite our efforts, we found ourselves at an impasse, unable to progress any further in unraveling the enigma.",1
"Arriving at the scene of the crime, I wasted no time in inspecting the room where the tragedy had occurred. The room was plain, with white walls and a bare floor stained around the edges. Despite my thorough search, I found nothing of interest except for a peculiar discovery hidden in a cupboard under one of the windows. A roll of Kodak films, smelling strongly of moth balls, was nestled in the corner. This unexpected find provided a crucial clue to the murder mystery, leading me to believe that the films had been dropped by the mysterious ""doctor"" during a struggle with the woman. Determined to unravel the truth, I left the house with the films in hand, eager to have them developed and delve deeper into the investigation.",1
"""She triumphantly pulled it out from the pocket of her sweater. The sudden tilt of the boat caused her to lose her balance, and in her attempt to steady herself by grabbing the rail, the roll of films slipped over the side. Mrs. Blair exclaimed, 'Oh!' in a comical display of dismay. Peering over the edge, she asked, 'Do you think they've gone overboard?' 'No, you might have been lucky enough to accidentally hit an unfortunate steward on the deck below.' Unnoticed, a young boy standing a few steps behind us blew a loud blast on a bugle. 'Lunch time!' Mrs. Blair announced with excitement. 'I haven't eaten since breakfast, except for two cups of beef-tea. Are you joining me for lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?' 'Well,' I hesitated.""",1
"We stood face to face, locked in a fierce gaze of animosity. It was the first time I truly observed his features - the closely cropped dark hair, the angular jawline, the scar on his tan cheek, and his piercing light grey eyes that held a hint of reckless disdain. There was an undeniable air of danger that surrounded him. ""You haven't even said thank you for me saving your sorry life,"" I taunted with feigned sweetness, delivering a blow that made him visibly recoil. I sensed his deep aversion to acknowledging his debt to me, but I relished in his discomfort. The desire to inflict pain upon him consumed me like never before. ""I wish you weren't around to save me in the first place!"" he exclaimed with explosive frustration.",1
"As Lord Yardly and I stood in the dimly lit room, a sudden darkness enveloped us. The sound of a door slamming echoed through the silence, followed by a chilling scream that sent shivers down our spines. ""Maude!"" Lord Yardly exclaimed, his voice filled with fear. Panic set in as we fumbled in the dark, attempting to reach the source of the disturbance. Finally, we located the door and flung it open. The scene before us was horrifying - Lady Yardly lay motionless on the cold floor, a red mark marring her pale throat where her necklace had been violently torn away. Unsure if she was alive or dead, we hovered over her, waiting for any sign of life. Slowly, her eyes fluttered open, revealing the fear and pain hidden within.",1
"“May I inquire as to your identity?” Poirot asked, taking a step closer and nodding respectfully. “I do hope that your husband won’t catch a cold. I couldn’t help but notice that he was wearing slippers and a rather warm dressing-gown.” “Who are you and what do you want?” demanded the woman, her voice filled with suspicion. “It is unfortunate that we have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, madame,” Poirot replied apologetically. “Especially considering that one of our party has traveled all the way from New York just to see you.” Suddenly, the curtains were drawn back and the figure of the Italian man emerged. To my dismay, I saw that he was holding my gun, which Poirot must have accidentally left behind in the taxi.",1
"It was well past midnight when I stood on the deck, gazing at the luminous wake left by the boat. The outline of Africa loomed in the distance, drawing closer as we sped through the black sea. In that moment, I found myself engulfed in a sense of solitude within a magnificent universe. Enveloped by an eerie calm, I lingered there, oblivious to the passage of time, lost in reverie. Abruptly, a strange feeling of imminent peril washed over me. Though there was no sound, a sudden instinct made me whirl around. A shadowy figure had stealthily approached from behind. Before I could react, it pounced. With a firm grip on my neck, it silenced any potential outcry. Despite my frantic struggles, I knew the odds were against me.",1
"That was an undeniable fact. An estate. Perhaps the origin of a noble bloodline. (Lost heir? Title contender?) Or maybe a charming dilapidated building. (Hidden riches?) Indeed, I was leaning towards the notion of hidden treasure. Enigmas always accompany hidden treasure. One step to the east, seven steps to the west, excavate one yard, descend twenty-two stairs. That type of concept. I could develop that later. The priority was to reach Kilmorden Castle promptly. I embarked on a calculated expedition from my quarters and came back loaded with research materials. _Who’s Who_, Whitaker, a Geographical Dictionary, a Compilation of Scottish Ancestral Dwellings, and a Publication on the British Isles. Moments slipped away.",1
"""You never encountered a woman like her before! She must be at least forty, with pince-nez perched on her nose, sensible boots, and an air of brisk efficiency that could be the end of me. A woman with a face as expressionless as a slab of marble."" ""Do you think she will cling to your arm?"" ""I sincerely hope not!"" Sir Eustace exclaimed. ""That would be unbearable. Farewell, enchanting eyes. If I happen to shoot a lion, I will not be giving you its skin after how you have abandoned me."" He gave my hand a firm squeeze and we went our separate ways. Suzanne was already waiting for me in the entrance hall. She had come to see me off. ""Let's not waste any time,"" I hurriedly suggested, signaling to the doorman to hail a taxi.",1
"His whole demeanor shifted when he chuckled. His face took on a youthful, joyful, almost unrecognizable appearance. I savored my soup, gently reminding him that he had yet to offer me his counsel. ""Ah, indeed, what I meant to suggest was this: If I were in your shoes, I would lay low here until you have fully recuperated. Your foes will assume you perished. They will not be surprised by the absence of your body. It would have been shattered against the cliffs and swept away by the current."" A chill ran down my spine. ""Once you have regained your strength, you can discreetly travel to Beira and secure passage on a ship bound for England."" ""That sounds dreadfully dull,"" I scoffed. ""That remark betrays a lack of wisdom.""",1
"It remains uncertain how long the girl has been in that place, but it is quite evident that she is not Anne. There is a certain level of discretion when it comes to meddling in the affairs of others. If I were in his shoes, I would not hesitate to remove Race from the island if he dared to pry into my personal matters. The decision has been made, I will depart for Jo'burg tomorrow. Race is adamant that I do so. The situation there is deteriorating, according to reports, so it is best to leave before it escalates further. I am prepared to face the possibility of being shot by a striker. Initially, Mrs. Blair was supposed to accompany me, yet she had a change of heart at the last moment and opted to remain at the Falls.",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had captivated Paris, gracefully acknowledged the applause and disappeared backstage. Her dressing room was filled with bouquets and luxurious garments, as Jeanne, her dresser, chattered on. A knock at the door interrupted them. The mysterious Count Sergius Paulovitch had arrived, a man of elegance and weariness. Switching to English, they discussed the 'Colonel,' a criminal mastermind planning his retirement. Nadina revealed her plan to travel to London incognito, arousing the Count's curiosity. He mentioned a fortune teller's prophecy about the 'Colonel's' downfall involving a woman, sparking Nadina's interest. They speculated on the 'Colonel's' future and the mysteries that lay ahead.",1
"""I consider it my personal property,"" he stated confidently. However, I viewed the responsibility as the one area where a secretary truly proved their worth. ""Let's book an additional cabin,"" I suggested quickly. The task appeared straightforward, yet Pagett thrived on creating enigmas. The following day, he approached me with the countenance of a Renaissance plotter. ""You instructed me to reserve Cabin 17 as an office, correct?"" ""Yes, what about it? Is the stationery trunk blocking the entrance?"" ""The doorways are identical in all cabins,"" Pagett responded gravely. ""But trust me, Sir Eustace, there's something unsettling about that particular cabin."" Thoughts of The Upper Berth by F. Marion Crawford crossed my mind.",1
"""No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, do you happen to have it on you? I would quite like to take a look at it."" I had brought along the paper as Exhibit A, and I passed it to her. She examined it closely, her brow furrowed. “There’s a dot after the number 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 as well?” “There's a gap,” I observed. “Indeed, there is a gap, but” Suddenly, she stood up and leaned over the paper, bringing it as close to the light as possible. There was a barely contained thrill in her demeanor. “Anne, that’s not a dot! It’s a defect in the paper! A defect in the paper, do you understand? Therefore, you must disregard it and focus solely on the spaces, the spaces!” I rose to my feet and stood beside her.",1
"As I attempted to exit through the hall door, I quickly realized it was not an option. With no other choice, I cautiously made my way up to the attic, tightly securing my restraints before laying back down on the cold floor. I stayed still, anticipating the possibility of being discovered. Thankfully, no one came to investigate. After what seemed like an eternity, I cautiously descended the staircase, only to find the Kafir standing watch by the door, his gentle humming filling the air. Feeling trapped, I retreated back to the attic once more. It was evident that the Kafir was determined to keep a close eye on me throughout the night. I waited in silence as the noises of morning preparations echoed through the house.",1
"I am completely agitated. The dreadful breakfast I had was accompanied by dreadful company. Slow Dutch waitresses served me subpar fish after making me wait. The ordeal of waking up at 5 a.m. to see a doctor upon arrival at the port is exhausting. But now, a serious issue has arisen. I presented Milray’s sealed letter to the Prime Minister, only to find a blank sheet inside. Pagett, a constant source of annoyance, seems pleased by my predicament. Despite my reluctance, I had to entertain his theory about Rayburn. The situation is escalating, and I am eager to leave for Rhodesia. I have made it clear to Pagett that he will not be joining me on this journey. My reputation as an English Member of Parliament is at stake.",1
"I had embarked from Southampton on the 17th, carrying a precious paper that bore the numbers 17, 1, and 22. My deduction was that 17 referred to Cabin 17 and 1 to one o'clock. As tomorrow was the 22nd, I was convinced that something significant would occur at 1 a.m. My evening was restless as I awaited the appointed hour. When it came, I heard the hurried footsteps of a man outside my cabin. Without hesitation, I concealed him from pursuers, all while maintaining the appearance of a lady washing her neck. The unexpected arrival of a stewardess provided a moment of tension, but the drunk intruder in my cabin turned out to have been stabbed. Despite his defiance, I tended to his wound, demanding no gratitude in return.",1
"There it would be impracticable and impossible so the Prime Minister vanishes. The police of this country rush across the Channel, and no one bothers to investigate the details of the first attack. To maintain the illusion that the abduction occurred in France, Daniels is silenced and rendered unconscious in a convincing manner.” “And the individual who has portrayed the role of the Prime Minister?” “Gets rid of his disguise. He and the fake chauffeur might be detained as suspicious individuals, but nobody will think to suspect their true involvement in the plot, and they will eventually be set free due to lack of proof.” “And the genuine Prime Minister?” “He and O’Murphy were taken directly to the residence of ‘Mrs.",1
"We raced to Cape Town as soon as possible. Suzanne greeted me there, and together we dismantled the giraffe. Colonel Race suggested we move into Sir Lawrence Eardsley's villa at Muizenberg. Plans were made for me to return to England with Suzanne, getting married in London with the trousseau from Paris. Suzanne loved planning, but the future felt unreal. The night before we sailed, Harry appeared, urging me to run away with him to Rhodesia. I followed him, feeling like a lunatic in love. It's been two years since then, living on the island. Suzanne wrote a letter, calling us lunatics. Another letter arrived from Bolivia, offering me a diary to use as I please. I may now be Lady Eardsley, but the past still haunts me.",1
"He needed to fake his death, escape to a different country with his wife, and change his identity. To make sure his wife had control of the money, he altered his will. A rough tramp intruded into their garden, leading to an unexpected opportunity for the couple. They quickly devised a plan to shift the blame onto the tramp's body, dressing it in the man's clothes and stabbing it with an aeroplane dagger. The husband would then bury the body, ensuring it was found later to divert suspicion. In the meantime, he would disguise himself as the tramp and quietly leave town. However, their carefully laid out plan faced unexpected challenges when a girl named Bella showed up at their door, threatening to unravel everything.",1
"I found myself staring ahead, a sense of confusion settling in. Norman and I were a formidable pair, capable of handling any challenge. Surprisingly, our journey continued northward, bypassing London altogether. This unexpected detour left me bewildered. Gradually, as the car decelerated, the familiar sights of Hendon Aerodrome came into view. Poirot's plan became clear to me in an instant - we were to fly to France. While bold, the idea seemed impractical at first glance. Sending a telegram would undoubtedly be faster. Time was of the essence, and Poirot would have to forego the personal accolades of saving the Prime Minister. As we came to a stop, Major Norman exited the vehicle, replaced by an undercover officer.",1
"I meekly agreed to his request for company, though apprehensive of the consequences. Before his departure, I inquired about his name, to which he casually replied, ""Harry Rayburn."" The sudden onset of seasickness during the journey left me incapacitated and indifferent to my original mission. However, a kind gesture from Mrs. Flemming led to a change in plans, as I decided to embark on a new adventure in South Africa. With a generous parting gift in hand, I set out on my journey, eventually finding some solace on deck and observing the intriguing passengers around me. The arrival in Madeira brought a glimmer of hope, as the scent of violets lifted my spirits and made me consider enduring the remainder of the voyage.",1
"Just as he approached him, the man glanced quickly up and down the street, then took a small item from his pocket and tossed it over the fence before continuing on to the station. The 'chink' of the object hitting the ground piqued the interest of a man in the ditch, who found a ring. Kellett claims this story, but Lowen denies it vehemently. There is a possibility that he encountered Davenheim in the lane, but Poirot finds it highly unlikely. Japp agrees, noting that Lowen's actions seem odd. Poirot suggests that the ring could have been planted near the scene. Japp mentions a lime kiln nearby that could have been used to dispose of the body. Poirot contemplates the situation, leaving Japp and the narrator puzzled.",1
"Mrs. Davenheim is described as a pleasant but not very bright woman, and it is mentioned that Mr. Davenheim had many financial rivals who may bear ill will towards him. A gardener saw a figure near the rose-garden, and there is speculation about suicide or foul play. Poirot examines a photograph of the missing man and finds the case to be quite obscure. Japp later reveals that Mr. Davenheim's clothes were found near the lake, and Lowen, a suspect, was seen near the study around the time of the disappearance. A pawned ring belonging to Mr. Davenheim further complicates the case. The narrative ends with the introduction of Billy Kellett, who provides a strange account of his activities on the day of the disappearance.",1

Nadina, accustomed to praise and admiration, made her way to the dressing-room where Jeanne, her loyal dresser, awaited her. Amidst the bouquets and luxurious garments, a visitor arrived - Count Sergius Paulovitch. Switching to English, they engaged in a cryptic conversation about the enigmatic 'Colonel' and his impending retirement. Nadina hinted at a mysterious plan involving a trip to London, leaving the Count intrigued and curious. As they exchanged knowing glances, the future seemed uncertain and filled with intrigue.",1
"""Clearly, Giraud has missed the mark entirely. If Jack Renauld is truly guilty, it is despite Giraud's misguided arguments, not because of them. The most damning evidence against him is a secret that only I am aware of.""""What is it?"" I inquired, feeling intrigued.""If you were to engage your intellect, and analyze the case with the same clarity that I possess, you would also uncover it, my dear friend.""Poirot's response irritated me, as usual. Without pausing, he continued, ""Let us stroll towards the shoreline. We will perch on that small hill there, with a view of the beach, and reexamine the case. I will share all my insights with you, but I would rather you arrive at the truth independently, without my guidance.""",1

That’s a big building near Knightsbridge, right?” Parker inquired, surprised. Mrs. Robinson nodded, a worried expression creeping onto her face. “Could it be haunted?” Parker dismissed the idea, declaring he had never heard of a haunted flat. “There were a few odd things, though,” Mrs. Robinson admitted. She went on to explain how they found the flat, despite being told it was already taken. After signing the agreement, they were set to move in the following day. “What a strange story,” Poirot pondered, intrigued by the inexplicable cheapness of the flat.",1

My focus naturally gravitated towards Chichester, leading me to reluctantly consider the fate of Sir Eustace and Mr..",1
"There were no clues to her identity or whereabouts. Mrs. Havering hired Mrs. Middleton as a housekeeper through Selbourne's Agency. However, Mrs. Middleton had no record with the Agency. Poirot suspected foul play and instructed to find out what vehicle took her to Hunter's Lodge, but no leads were found. It was later revealed that Mrs. Havering and her husband were the masterminds behind Mr. Pace's murder and the missing Liberty Bonds. Despite their crimes, justice caught up with them in a tragic accident. Miss Farquhar sought Poirot's help in solving the case of the stolen bonds, involving her fiancé, Mr. Ridgeway. The bonds disappeared mysteriously on board the Olympia, and Poirot agreed to investigate further.",1
"""I was preparing for a lengthy journey, unsure when I would return. It was important for me to see her one last time, to make sure she knew my feelings were unwavering."" Poirot maintained unbreakable eye contact as he questioned Renauld's actions. After a significant pause, Renauld finally responded, confirming that he did see her. ""What happened next?"" Poirot pressed. ""I missed the final train, so I trekked to St. Beauvais and managed to secure a car from a nearby garage to transport me back to Cherbourg."" ""St. Beauvais? That's quite a distance to walk, M. Renauld."" ""I needed the time to think."" Poirot nodded in understanding as Renauld made his exit, grabbing his hat and cane before disappearing into the night.",1
"Lady Yardly was ushered into the room, her dark, flashing eyes betraying her concern. She acknowledged that she, too, had received mysterious letters regarding the diamond, with a hint of Eastern influence. Unfortunately, the letters had been destroyed, leaving them with no further clues. Lady Yardly decided to leave, entrusting Captain Hastings with the information to relay to Poirot. When Poirot returned, he seemed intrigued by the developments and decided to involve Lord Yardly in the investigation. Despite some initial reservations, Poirot was determined to solve the case and protect the family diamond. Lord Yardly, a cheerful and somewhat simple man, was puzzled by the situation, seeking answers from Poirot.",1
"""But all my efforts would have been futile if I had attended. The same goes for those who claim to be 'experts.' Look at the handwriting analysis in the Cavendish Case. One lawyer’s interrogation reveals similarities, while the defense presents evidence of differences. It’s all very technical. And the outcome? Simply confirming what we already suspected. The writing closely resembled that of John Cavendish. And now the mind is left pondering 'Why?' Was it truly his handwriting? Or was someone trying to mislead us? I have unraveled that mystery, my friend, and I have done so accurately."" With that, Poirot, having effectively silenced me, if not entirely convinced, reclined in his chair with an air of contentment.",1
"""In the event that you are stopped during your journey, I will furnish you with two distinct permits. One will be authorized by the Union Government, while the other will identify you as a British tourist uninvolved with the Union in any capacity."" ""A permit for each side, is that the idea?"" ""Precisely."" The task did not interest me as I am familiar with the potential consequences in such scenarios. Confusion inevitably arises, leading to errors. Handing the incorrect permit to the wrong individual could result in my prompt execution by an insurrectionist or a law enforcement officer. I observed the latter patrolling the streets, donning bowler hats, smoking pipes, and casually carrying rifles under their arms.",1
"I couldn't believe my luck when I saw my target casually sipping beef tea by the rail. I approached him with a friendly smile, hoping to smooth things over after the cabin mix-up. Mr. Chichester, however, was not so forgiving. As we exchanged words, I couldn't help but notice that his skin was surprisingly fair for someone who claimed to have spent two years in the depths of Africa. His reaction to a dropped paper only deepened my suspicions. It was clear that Mr. Chichester was not to be trusted. Later, during a conversation about Italy, the strange behavior of Mr. Pagett only added to my growing list of suspects. The more I observed, the more I realized that any one of them could be hiding something sinister.",1
"“No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” Poirot calmly pointed out. The inspector was taken aback by his confidence. Poirot then demonstrated his deductions swiftly, proving that the chambermaid couldn't have hidden the necklace. The inspector, satisfied, continued his search and found the necklace hidden in the maid's bed. Mrs. Opalsen was relieved to have it back, even though Poirot suspected it was an imitation. He decided to keep this information to himself, knowing that the true thief had not been caught. Poirot and his companion left the room, but Poirot's mind was already working on the next steps to solve the case.",1
"His cohorts may have incapacitated him with a cloth and chloroform, but I fail to see what their goal was. He is unlikely to be of any help to them now, as he will be closely monitored until the situation with the Prime Minister is resolved. It's possible that he intended to mislead the police? However, he claims that something was placed over his nose and mouth, and he recalls nothing beyond that. This does not lead the investigation astray; it sounds remarkably truthful. Let's head to the station. France may reveal more clues. Although I have my doubts. It's astonishing that the Prime Minister hasn't been found in such a confined area. If the military and police of two nations haven't located him, how can I?",1
"As we drove around in the afternoon, a flat tire caused a delay. By the time I returned to the Grand Metropolitan, it was already past 8 o'clock. The first thing I saw was Poirot, looking even smaller than usual, standing between the Opalsens with a look of contentment. ""My dear Hastings!"" he exclaimed, rushing over to greet me. ""Give me a hug, my friend; everything has gone perfectly!"" Fortunately, the hug was only a gesture, something one can never be certain of with Poirot. ""Are you saying"" I started. ""Absolutely marvelous, I must say!"" Mrs. Opalsen chimed in, her chubby face beaming. ""I told you, Ed, that if anyone could recover my pearls, it would be him."" ""You certainly did, my love, you certainly did.""",1
"Then, his expression brightening, he hurried over to the desk. Within moments, he was sifting through the deceased man's checkbook. After a moment, he gestured with excitement. The final stub was left untouched. ""Courage!"" exclaimed Poirot, giving him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. ""Undoubtedly, Madame Renauld will have valuable insight into this enigmatic individual known as Duveen."" The police commissioner's demeanor lightened. ""You're right. Let's move forward."" As we prepared to exit the room, Poirot offhandedly mentioned: ""This is where M. Renauld entertained his visitor last evening, correct?"" ""Yes, but how could you possibly know that?"" ""By this. I discovered it on the rear of the leather armchair.""",1
"We drove past the town and reached a fork in the road. A peasant directed us to the Villa Geneviève, but as we looked for it, a girl caught our attention. She was a vision of beauty, with a golden head and anxious eyes. Poirot and I were intrigued by her presence. Suddenly, we were stopped by a sergent de ville who delivered the shocking news of Mr. Renauld's murder. Poirot sprang into action, seeking answers from the authorities. The commissary welcomed us and Poirot revealed that the victim had foreseen his own demise. As we entered the Villa, the examining magistrate was ready to begin his investigations. The crime had occurred in the early hours of the morning, and the mystery was waiting to be unraveled.",1
"I hadn’t meant to disturb him by advertising my presence. But suddenly I heard a light footfall behind me, and his voice broke the silence: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned around. “I want to apologize. I behaved like a boor last night.” “It was a peculiar night,” I replied. “You may not know, but you are in danger,” he warned. “They are ruthless. Your only chance is to persuade them they’re mistaken. Be careful, always be on the lookout for danger. If you fall into their hands, tell the whole truth.” “Why warn me?” I asked. “It may be the last thing I can do for you,” he said. “Goodbye,” he said as he left, his footsteps echoing along the deck. I was left alone, wondering about the danger that lay ahead.",1
"I never expected to find myself in such a situation. As a crime novelist, I had always imagined myself writing about thrilling events, not actually experiencing them. But here I was, faced with a wounded man in my cabin on the Kilmorden Castle. The night had taken a turn I had never anticipated. It all started with a number - 17. Little did I know that this seemingly innocuous number would lead me down a path of danger and intrigue. The man before me, wounded and defiant, was a puzzle waiting to be solved. And I, with my histrionic talents and quick thinking, was determined to unravel the mystery that lay before me. It was a night I would never forget, a night that would forever change the course of my life.",1
"Madame Beroldy was the kind of woman who could captivate any man. Her beauty and mysterious aura drew people in, including the wealthy American, Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. But behind closed doors, a dark and twisted plot was unfolding. One fateful night, the Beroldys' home was breached by masked intruders, leading to a gruesome discovery. Madame Beroldy was found bound and gagged, while her husband lay lifeless with a knife through his heart. The investigation pointed towards Madame Beroldy and her alleged lover, Georges Conneau. Despite her royal blood claims and elaborate stories, the truth eventually came to light when a confession letter from Conneau surfaced, revealing the shocking extent of their deadly plan.",1
"Poirot and I had arrived at Marsdon Manor to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had recently insured his life for a large sum of money. The circumstances surrounding his death seemed suspicious, especially considering his financial troubles. We spoke to Dr. Bernard, the only doctor in the area, who confirmed that Mr. Maltravers had died from an internal hemorrhage. However, the doctor's vague responses raised some doubts in Poirot's mind. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was distraught and beautiful, and she shared that her husband had insured his life because he believed he would die soon. Poirot noticed a discrepancy in the case, but before we could investigate further, a tall young man approached us.",1
"""And once again, there was nothing to be found. No balcony in sight."" ""Even if there was,"" the inspector remarked impatiently, ""I fail to see how that would be of any use to us, given that the maid claims she never left the room."" ""Of course,"" Poirot responded calmly, unfazed. ""If Mademoiselle is certain she did not exit the room."" Before he could continue, the chambermaid and the police searcher reappeared. ""Nothing,"" the searcher stated bluntly. ""Well, I should hope not,"" the chambermaid declared indignantly. ""And that French woman should be ashamed for tarnishing an innocent girl's reputation!"" ""There, there, my dear; it's all right,"" the inspector reassured, as he opened the door. ""No one suspects you.""",1
"""I’m certain Colonel Race finds you quite captivating, Anne. Just a few glances from those mischievous eyes of yours, and the trap is set. Everyone seems to get engaged on a cruise. There’s simply nothing else to occupy oneself.” “Marriage is not on my agenda.” “Is that so?” Suzanne questioned. “Why ever not? I find marriage delightful, even with Clarence!” I dismissed her casual attitude. “What concerns me,” I stated firmly, “is Colonel Race's involvement in all of this. He is definitely part of the puzzle.” “Do you truly believe it was mere coincidence, his recounting that tale?” “Absolutely not,” I asserted. “He was observing us all intently. You recall, some of the diamonds were recovered, but not all.""",1
"Marthe Daubreuil had a plan, but it was thwarted by a struggle with Madame Renauld. Although Marthe tried to make it look like suicide, she was checkmated by another woman with strong hands. Poirot suspected Marthe from the start, based on her anxious eyes. Madame Renauld's son, Jack, was kept in the dark about his father's past until Poirot revealed the truth. Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother. Poirot advised him to be honest with his love interest, Bella, and to ask for her forgiveness. In the end, Poirot received a visit from a film star, Mary Marvell, who was being threatened over a valuable diamond. Poirot advised her to keep the diamond safe until the threat had passed.",1
"“I can’t definitively determine the time of death based on the medical evidence, but it’s clear the victim has been deceased for more than twelve hours. Can you recall when was the last time you saw the murder weapon?” “Around ten o’clock yesterday morning,” I replied. “In that case, the crime likely occurred shortly after that.” “But there were witnesses passing by this shed all day,” I pointed out. Giraud chuckled sarcastically. “You are quite the detective! Who said the murder took place in this shed?” I hesitated, feeling flustered. “I just assumed.” “Oh, what a brilliant deduction! Tell me, do you believe a man stabbed in the heart would fall so neatly with his feet together and arms at his side? No.”",1
"""Poirot's comments on the underexposed interiors were unnecessary, showing his jealousy of my position on the case. His request for clothing details seemed ridiculous, but I complied. When Poirot advised Japp to arrest the housekeeper, it was too late. Mrs. Middleton had vanished, leaving behind only ordinary clothes. Mrs. Havering hired her from Selbourne's Agency, but they had no record of her. The mystery deepened as we realized she must have had a connection to the murder. Poirot instructed us to find out what vehicle took her to Hunter's Lodge. The local garage had no record of her using their services. Mrs. Havering had given her money for transportation, but none of the available options were used.""",1
"A large settee covered in chintz sat against the wall, while the window seats were also draped in the same faded chintz. Poirot, lighting a cigarette, discussed their plan. He believed the clue they sought was in the room, hidden among the documents in the desk. Despite not expecting to find the will, Poirot suspected a seemingly innocent paper held the key. After calling for Mrs. Baker, they learned about the will-signing and the mysterious workmen from Plymouth. Poirot deduced that a second will had been made, with a hiding spot created by the workmen. In Plymouth, they confirmed the details and discovered the hidden cavity behind a brick in the fireplace. With excitement, Poirot reached into the cavity.",1
"As various individuals attempted to make small talk in the casual setting of a boat, I couldn't help but notice how Mrs. Blair skillfully rebuffed their advances. It was clear that she had chosen the strong, silent man as her companion for the journey, and he seemed to appreciate the position. The next day, to my surprise, Mrs. Blair interrupted my solitude after a stroll with her companion. ""Feeling better today?"" she inquired. I expressed my gratitude for her concern, admitting that I was starting to feel more human. ""You looked quite unwell yesterday. Colonel Race and I were almost looking forward to a sea burial, but you've thwarted our plans,"" she remarked with a teasing smile. I chuckled in response.",1
"I never knew Ned's full name, if he even had one. When Harry arrived, soaking wet and dragging a dripping woman, Ned provided food and coffee, drying our clothes as we wrapped ourselves in bright Manchester blankets. Hidden in the hut, Ned went to find Sir Eustace's party, while I refused to go to Beira. Instead, I would join Suzanne and focus on my safety. The diamonds were to be deposited in Kimberley under the name Parker, with a code for messages. Ned signed off as ""Andy,"" ensuring genuine communication. My peace was short-lived, as Mrs. Blair barged in, worried about Anne's disappearance. Ignoring her dream, I asked about Race's whereabouts, refusing to take on all the worries of female companionship.",1
"Poirot handed back the worn English letter with a grave face. The magistrate assumed that M. Renauld was involved with an Englishwoman named Bella, leading to jealousy and threats. The case seemed simple at first, with a woman as the likely culprit due to the stabbing, but Poirot pointed out that the digging of the grave was a man's work. The masked men and the mysterious letter further complicated the investigation. The magistrate suggested looking into M. Renauld's past in Santiago for clues to his murder. Poirot agreed, praising the idea. The magistrate also mentioned involving M. Renauld's wife in the investigation and confirmed that there were no other letters from Bella among M. Renauld's belongings.",1
"""I specifically chose No. 17, and the purser told me I could have it."" ""I apologize,"" I stated icily. ""But No. 17 has already been assigned to me."" ""I cannot accept that."" The steward interjected. ""The other cabin is just as good, if not better."" ""I insist on having No. 17."" ""What is going on here?"" a new voice demanded. ""Steward, move my belongings here. This is my cabin."" It was the man I had lunch with, Rev. Edward Chichester. ""I apologize,"" I replied. ""It is assigned to Sir Eustace Pedler,"" Mr. Pagett explained. Tensions were rising. ""I regret having to disagree,"" Chichester said with a meek smile that failed to conceal his determination to have his way. Meek men are always stubborn, in my experience.",1
"“Never have I loved you like this!” Her lips softly grazed my cheek before finding mine, showering me with kisses filled with a passion that seemed unreal. The intensity of the moment, the sheer astonishment of it, will be etched in my memory forever. A noise from the doorway interrupted us, causing us to glance up. Poirot stood there, watching us intently. Without a second thought, I sprang towards him and restrained his arms. ""Hurry,"" I whispered to the woman. ""Leave now. Run as fast as you can. I'll handle him."" With a swift glance in my direction, she dashed out of the room. I held Poirot firmly, not letting him budge. ""My friend,"" remarked Poirot calmly, ""you are quite skilled at this type of thing.""",1
"A man with a history of hunting lions in large numbers possesses an unfair advantage over his peers. It struck me that it was about time I shared a lion-related anecdote as well, albeit of a livelier nature. ""Speaking of which,"" I interjected, ""I recall a rather thrilling story I was told. A companion of mine was on a hunting expedition in East Africa. One evening, he exited his tent for a particular purpose and was taken aback by a faint growl. Upon a sudden turn, he found himself face to face with a lion ready to pounce. His firearm was left inside the tent. Acting swiftly, he dodged, causing the lion to leap over him. Irritated by the miss, the lion emitted a growl and readied itself for another leap.""",1
"As it turns out, the choice is clear. Cinderella is the perfect fit. Cinderella, as you recall, married the Prince. Now, I may not be royalty, but "" She cut me off. ""Cinderella gave him a fair warning, I'm certain! Remember, she couldn't guarantee a transformation into a princess. At the end of the day, she was just a lowly scullery maid."" ""Now it's the Prince's chance to speak up,"" I interjected. ""And do you know what he did?"" ""No?"" ""‘Hell!’ exclaimed the Prince before kissing her!"" I mimicked the gesture. I found myself by the window in Poirot’s quarters, casually observing the street below. ""How odd,"" I muttered quietly. ""What's odd, my friend?"" inquired Poirot calmly, settled comfortably in his chair.",1
"""Giraud is in agreement with me, are you not, sir?"" Regardless of Giraud's true beliefs, he assumed the position without any visible reaction. Coolly and almost contemptuously, he responded: ""Indeed, I concur."" The crowd murmured in surprise and interest once more. ""But how absurd!"" exclaimed M. Hautet. ""To stab a man after he's already dead! Savage! Unprecedented! Perhaps driven by an insatiable hatred."" ""No, Judge,"" Poirot interjected. ""I suspect it was carried out with complete premeditation to make an impact."" ""What kind of impact?"" ""The kind of impact it almost achieved,"" replied Poirot enigmatically. M. Bex pondered for a moment. ""So, how did the man meet his end?"" ""He was not killed. He perished.""",1
"He handed me a cup of tea, unsweetened and ice cold, precisely at 6 o'clock. I drank it and quickly succumbed to exhaustion, drifting off into a deep sleep. When I awoke, I found myself just outside of Bulawayo, confronted by a grotesque wooden giraffe with elongated legs and neck. Despite these minor setbacks, everything had been proceeding smoothly until a new disaster struck. The incident occurred on the evening of our arrival at the Falls. I was giving dictation to Miss Pettigrew in my private sitting area when Mrs. Blair barged in unannounced, dressed inappropriately. ""Where is Anne?"" she demanded, as if I held the answers. An absurd inquiry, considering I had no control over the girl's whereabouts.",1
"I never considered myself to be particularly attractive. My features were far from the ideal standards of beauty - no straight Grecian nose or rosebud mouth for me. The only compliment I ever received was from a curate who compared my eyes to ""imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood"", but I always suspected he had a quote ready for every occasion. Personally, I would have preferred Irish blue eyes over my dark green ones with yellow flecks. However, green does have a certain allure for women of intrigue. Wrapping myself in a black garment, I left my arms and shoulders exposed. Tucking my hair behind my ears, I applied a generous amount of powder to my face, giving my skin an unnaturally pale complexion.",1
"I quickly ascended the stairs, my mind heavy with the weight of the tragedy. The room where the body was discovered was eerily silent, the only echo of the past being the muddy footprints left behind by the intruders. The police had already combed through the room, leaving nothing of interest in their wake. As I examined the plain white walls and bare floor, a glimmer of hope emerged when my pencil rolled under a window-seat cupboard. Retrieving it, my hand brushed against a forgotten roll of Kodak films. The fresh red paper hinted at a recent deposit, leading me to wonder who had dropped it - the woman or the man? The familiar scent of moth balls lingered on the films, igniting my suspicions once again.",1
"She was standing there with her eyes cast down, a faint enigmatic smile on her lips, filling me with a sense of fear, like one might feel towards a beautiful but deadly snake. Poirot, always polite, inquired about M. Stonor and Mrs. Renauld, to which Madame Daubreuil responded calmly. As we made our way to the Villa Geneviève, Poirot kept a watchful eye on the lighted window. Suddenly, a cry for help shattered the silence, prompting Poirot to take swift action. With Cinderella's acrobatic skills, a dangerous rescue mission unfolded. The tension mounted as the true identity of the murderer was revealed, leaving us all in shock. The night was filled with chaos and danger, but in the end, justice prevailed.",1
"""His face, once flushed with shock, turned deathly pale. 'An aeroplane wire paper cutter? That's what killed my father?' 'Yes, it seems so,' replied the detective. 'Sharp and easy to handle.' The tool had been removed from the body, but M. Renauld requested to see it. The commissary was sent to retrieve it. Meanwhile, Poirot noticed a pair of candlesticks out of place. Suddenly, the commissary burst in, alarmed. 'The dagger is gone!' 'Gone?' exclaimed the magistrate. 'Vanished. The glass jar is empty!' Everyone turned to the witness, who admitted to visiting the shed that morning with a young English lady. The magistrate scolded him for the irregularity, but softened at the mention of youth and beauty.""",1
"He embraced me tightly, whispering ""Black-haired enchantress"" as he planted kisses on my head, eyes, and lips. ""Time to get down to business,"" he declared, setting me free. ""Fetch the cans of paraffin."" Obeying his command, I watched as he busied himself in the cabin. Soon enough, he appeared on the hut's roof, carrying something in his arms. After a short while, he returned to me. ""Head to the boat. We need to transport it to the other side of the island."" Grabbing the paraffin, he instructed me to vanish. ""They're approaching,"" I warned quietly, noticing a blur emerging from the far shore. He hurried down to me. ""Just in the nick of time. Where the devil is the boat?"" Both vessels had been set adrift.",1
"With a stroke of brilliance, I gave it a swift kick, followed by two punches, leaving a dent on the crown and attaching a bizarre ornament reminiscent of a cubist's interpretation of a jazz vegetable. The outcome was undeniably stylish. The vegetable ornament was promptly removed, and I set out to reverse the rest of my modifications. The ""Mary"" hat reverted back to its original state, now sporting a worn-out look that only added to its dismal charm. I decided to fully embrace the image of an orphan as best as I could. As I prepared to face Mrs. Flemming, I was slightly anxious about her reaction, but I hoped my appearance would serve as a disarming distraction. Mr. Flemming appeared to share my unease.",1
"""A clandestine rendezvous for instructions!"" ""Do not hiss in my direction, Pagett,"" I remarked, taking a step back, ""and please regulate your breath. Your suggestion is preposterous. What reason would they have for arranging a covert meeting in the dead of night? If they had anything to discuss, they could easily converse over a cup of tea in a nonchalant and ordinary manner."" Despite my arguments, it was clear that Pagett remained unconvinced. ""Something definitely occurred last night, Sir Eustace,"" he insisted, ""otherwise why would Rayburn viciously attack me."" ""You are positive it was Rayburn?"" Pagett seemed entirely certain of that detail. It was the one aspect of his account that lacked ambiguity.",1
"""In the first scene, there were clear impressions left by the suspect's heavy boots, but in the second scene, not a single mark! It's clear that someone deliberately tried to cover their tracks by smoothing out the bed with a rake.""""Where would they have found a rake?""""The same place they found the shovel and gardening gloves,"" Poirot replied impatiently. ""That shouldn't be hard to figure out.""""But why do you think they exited that way? Isn't it more likely they came in through the window and left through the door?""""Of course, that's a possibility. But my gut tells me they made their escape through the window.""""I disagree with you.""""Perhaps you're right, my friend. But my instincts tell me otherwise.""",1
"“What do you suggest we do with this pile of rubbish? Toss it into the river?” he inquired nonchalantly. “If that’s your preference,” I replied calmly. “I must say, Miss Beddingfeld, I do appreciate your unabashed, ruthless instincts. But we shall allow him to recuperate at his own pace. His injuries are not severe.” “You appear to balk at the idea of a second murder,” I remarked sweetly. “A second murder?” He appeared genuinely confused. “The woman in Marlow,” I reminded him, studying his reaction intently. A dark, brooding look clouded his face. It was as though he had forgotten I was there. “I may have been responsible for her death,” he confessed. “At times, I wonder if I had intended to harm her.",1
"As our people meticulously search through every inch of France, so do the French authorities. I have a sinking feeling that time is running out."" The tall detective grimly added, ""That is, if he's still breathing."" Japp's expression darkened. ""Yes, but there's something telling me he's still holding on."" Poirot concurred, ""Indeed, he's alive. But will we locate him in time? I, like all of you, never imagined he could remain hidden for so long."" The sound of the whistle signaled our departure into the Pullman car. Reluctantly, the train pulled away from the station. The journey was filled with tension as the Scotland Yard detectives huddled together, studying maps of Northern France with intense focus.",1
"I quickly realized that the girl was more interested in the crime scene than I had anticipated. Her fascination with the gruesome details was unsettling, but I couldn't deny the thrill of showing her around. As we approached the shed, I hesitated, knowing what we were about to see would be disturbing. But she was eager to continue, her curiosity outweighing any sense of caution. Inside, I revealed the victim's body, the sight of which caused her to recoil in horror. It was clear she had underestimated the impact of the scene. I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction as she struggled to come to terms with the reality of the crime. In the end, she learned that some things are better left unseen.",1
"And the moral of the story is that a criminal's lack of originality will be their downfall. They will repeat the same crime in the same way, leading to their inevitable capture. This lack of creativity in criminal behavior is a key clue for detectives like Hercule Poirot. The small details, like a wristwatch gaining two hours or footprints in a flower-bed, can reveal the true identity of the criminal behind the acts. When Gabriel Stonor, the well-travelled secretary, enters the scene, his connections and insights shed new light on the case. His lack of knowledge about certain names and incidents, like Duveen and Bella, only adds to the mystery at hand. The truth is out there, waiting to be uncovered.",1
"As Anne Beddingfeld stood on the boat deck, the breathtaking sight of Table Mountain in the distance took her by surprise. The morning sunlight gilded the sleeping town below, casting a spell of beauty that she couldn't help but admire. The fluffy white clouds hovering above the mountain added to the magic of the moment. It was a scene that filled her with a sense of longing and wonder, a moment of pure, unadulterated romance that she had been yearning for since leaving Little Hampsly. The Kilmorden glided closer and closer, the whole experience feeling like a dream. But Anne, ever the dreamer, couldn't resist the urge to soak in every detail, to imprint the memory of this moment forever in her mind.",1
"I woke up from a nightmare, a horrifying one where she was in grave danger. Alarmed, I rushed to her room to check on her safety. To my dismay, she was nowhere to be found, and her bed appeared untouched. She gazed at me with concern. ""What do you suggest, Sir Eustace?"" Tempted to respond with a dismissive remark, I instead furrowed my brow thoughtfully. ""Just go to bed, and try not to fret unnecessarily. A capable young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is more than capable of looking after herself."" I inquired, ""What is Race's opinion on this matter?"" It was time to challenge Race's authority and allow him to experience both the benefits and drawbacks of female company. ""I've searched everywhere for him.",1
"I motioned for her to take a seat on the couch and urged her to share her troubles. She divulged every detail to me, taking care to not leave anything out. After I had listened intently, she let out a heavy breath. Surprisingly, she didn't react the way I had anticipated. Instead of scolding or criticizing, she simply chuckled and remarked, ""You know, Anne, you're quite an extraordinary young woman. Have you never felt any doubts?"" Perplexed, I inquired, ""Doubts?"" She repeated, ""Yes, doubts, doubts, doubts! Venturing out on your own with barely a penny to your name. What will you do if you end up in a foreign land with no money left?"" ""There's no use worrying about that until it happens,"" I replied.",1
"“Poirot, we need your help urgently,” Lord Estair said, his face grave. “The Prime Minister has disappeared, kidnapped on his way to France for an important conference. We must act quickly.” Poirot's brow furrowed as he listened to the details of the case. The Prime Minister's car had been ambushed, shots fired, and the driver, O’Murphy, had taken a detour off the main road, only to disappear later. The Secretary, Daniels, was found bound and gagged, but alive. There were too many unanswered questions, too many variables to consider. Poirot pondered over the situation, weighing the facts carefully. “This is a dark and complex case,” he muttered to himself. “We must proceed with caution and method.”",1
"Harry Rayburn sat quietly between the rough wooden walls of the small room, his presence casting a shadow over the scene. Anne, still weak and bruised, looked up at him with tears streaming down her face. She longed to hold on to this moment, to die with his hand in hers. Rayburn's eyes held a new tenderness as he offered her a cup of milk, speaking softly and reassuringly. Despite the pain and confusion, Anne found solace in his presence, feeling safe and protected for the first time since the nightmare began. She clung to him, desperate for his comfort and the hope he brought with him. Rayburn stayed by her side, a silent guardian in the darkness of the room, promising to keep her safe from harm.",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer, had captivated the audience in Paris with her performance. Her black eyes sparkled with pride as she graciously accepted the Manager's praise. After the show, in her dressing room filled with bouquets and luxurious garments, she received a surprise visitor - Count Sergius Paulovitch. A sense of intrigue filled the room as they conversed in English, revealing a shared history of espionage and suspicion. The Count mentioned the retirement of the elusive 'Colonel,' a criminal mastermind who had always managed to evade capture. Nadina, however, had a plan of her own. She declared her intention to travel to London incognito, leaving behind a trail of mystery and anticipation.",1
"Poirot was about to call the police, but the man begged him not to. Poirot pushed the man down the steps and they hurried inside and locked the door. Poirot led them into a room, instructing the Italian to hide behind a curtain. Just in time, a woman burst into the room looking for her husband. Poirot reassured her and introduced himself. The Italian emerged brandishing a revolver, causing the woman to panic. Poirot calmed her down and she revealed the secret hiding place of incriminating evidence. Poirot let her go and assured her escape, before the Italian attempted to shoot her, only to find the gun unloaded. Poirot scolded him for carrying a loaded weapon and assured the safety of all involved.",1
"Revised text excerpt: ""If she was able to eavesdrop on that, there is no reason she wouldn't have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were careless enough to discuss their plans while seated on the bench. Recall how effortlessly you caught Marthe conversing with Jack Renauld from that very location."" ""But what reason could Marthe possibly have for killing Mr. Renauld?"" I countered. ""What reason? Greed! M. Renauld was a multi-millionaire, and upon his demise (or so she and Jack thought) half of that immense fortune would go to his son. Let's imagine the scenario from Marthe Daubreuil's perspective. ""Marthe Daubreuil listens in on the conversation between Renauld and his wife.""",1
"""My father passed away when I was just six years old. A few years later, my mother also left this world. The only family I had left was my Uncle Andrew, who had returned from Australia and bought Crabtree Manor, a small farmhouse, in his home county. Despite his kind treatment of me, he had very traditional views on the upbringing of women, valuing practical skills over book knowledge. I, however, rebelled against his wishes, determined to pursue my education. When my uncle passed away, his will revealed a challenge for me - to prove my intelligence within a year to inherit his fortune. I enlisted the help of Hercule Poirot to solve this puzzle, believing it to be a test of wits left by my uncle.""",1
"I inspected the paper that he had lost, a plain half-sheet with some figures and words scribbled in pencil. The scent of moth balls lingered as I carefully folded it and placed it in my bag. Walking home slowly, I pondered over the strange feeling I had during the Tube incident. At the inquest, it was confirmed that the deceased was L. B. Carton, who had checked in at the Russell Hotel. The jury speculated wildly about what could have alarmed him, even suggesting a fear of cats. As the coroner questioned me, I maintained that it was an accident caused by a moment of panic. The case took a surprising turn when a woman was found murdered in a lonely house in Marlow, bringing new mysteries to light.",1
"“And yet,” whispered the magistrate, “it seemed so promising at the start, such a simple and beautiful case.” His eyes briefly met Mrs. Renauld's, causing a sudden blush to spread across his face. “Ah, indeed,” he cleared his throat, shuffling through the documents scattered on the desk. “Now, where were we? Ah, yes, the murder weapon. I'm afraid this may be difficult for you, M. Renauld. I believe it was a gift from you to your mother. Quite tragic, very distressing.” Jack Renauld leaned in closer, his complexion turning from flushed to a ghostly pallor. “Are you suggesting that my father was killed with a mere aeroplane wire paper cutter? It can't be! Such a trivial object!” “Unfortunately, M.",1
"""Furthermore, there is additional evidence that, prior to his demise, he was engaged in a romantic entanglement with a French woman, known as Madame Daubreuil, who resides in the neighboring Villa. Can you believe that this is the same man who, as you claim, had no interest in women's company?"" The secretary's gaze sharpened. ""Wait a minute, Judge. You're on the wrong track. I was acquainted with Paul Renauld. What you are suggesting is simply not possible. There must be some other explanation."" The judge shrugged. ""Then what alternative explanation do you propose?"" ""On what basis do you conclude it was a romantic relationship?"" ""Madame Daubreuil would frequently visit him here in the evenings.""",1
"I recall the man who had pretended to be Sir Eustace. He was sly, but charming in his own way. Colonel Race was determined to see justice served, though I had my doubts. The man had a network of spies and a well-planned escape route. Despite my lukewarm response, the conversation shifted to Harry's innocence. Colonel Race revealed Harry's true identity, leaving me stunned. Harry confessed his deception, fearing my reaction. As I processed his story, discrepancies emerged. He explained the tragic fate of his friend Lucas and the reasons for his deception. Harry's true motives were finally laid bare, leaving me conflicted. I couldn't help but feel a pang of regret that the truth had come to light.",1
"M. Hautet bid us farewell, laughing heartily and enchanted with himself. Poirot, on the other hand, called him an old imbecile, showing his disdain. Just as we were leaving the building, we ran into Giraud, looking pleased with himself. Poirot hinted that the end of the case was near, but Giraud was dismissive. Poirot then challenged Giraud to a bet, claiming he would find the real murderer before him. Despite Giraud's initial reluctance, he finally agreed. As we walked, Poirot's determination was evident, causing me to doubt my ability to protect Bella. Suddenly, Gabriel Stonor joined us, expressing his belief in Jack Renauld's innocence. Stonor's words gave me hope in the midst of uncertainty.",1
""" Poirot took a seat once more, fixing his gaze on me, his contemplative demeanor more pronounced than before. “So, Hastings, are you absolutely convinced that Madame Daubreuil is responsible for M. Renauld’s death?” “Yes.” “But why?” The question caught me off guard with its suddenness. “Why?” I hesitated. “Why? Well, because…” My voice trailed off. Poirot gave a knowing look. “You see, you hit a roadblock immediately. Why would Madame Daubreuil (for clarity’s sake, let’s refer to her as such) want to kill M. Renauld? We can’t seem to find a single reason. She gains nothing from his death; whether as a lover or a blackmailer, she has nothing to gain. A murder without a motive is inconceivable.",1
"Madame Beroldy was a mysterious woman who seemed to have ensnared the hearts of many, including the wealthy Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. However, tragedy struck when Madame Beroldy's husband was found murdered in their apartment. The investigation led to a trial where Madame Beroldy was accused of the crime. Despite the evidence against her, Madame Beroldy's eloquence and charm won the jury over, resulting in her acquittal. Georges Conneau, her lover, was suspected of the crime but never found. The case remained a mystery, with Madame Beroldy eventually leaving Paris with her child to start a new life. The details of the case were carefully examined, revealing the true nature of the characters involved.",1
"My father passed away when I was a child. A few years later, my mother also died. I was left with only my Uncle Andrew, who took me in and treated me like his own daughter. He strongly believed in practical skills over book knowledge and was against women receiving education. Despite his wishes, I pursued my studies and won a scholarship. When my uncle passed away, I discovered that he had left a challenging will, giving me a year to prove my intelligence. I sought the help of Monsieur Poirot to unravel the mystery hidden within Crabtree Manor. We were welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. Baker, who had worked for my uncle. The next morning, our investigation began in earnest in the late Mr. Marsh's study.",1
"""I am the product of my father's legacy. Would anyone accept me if they knew the truth?"" ""You are indeed your father's son. My colleague Hastings can attest to my belief in the power of genetics."" ""Alright, then."" ""Wait. I know of a remarkable woman, one filled with bravery and resilience, capable of immense love and selflessness."" The young man's gaze lifted. His expression softened. ""My mother!"" ""Yes. You carry both your mother's and father's traits within you. Go now to Mademoiselle Bella. Confide in her completely. Hold nothing back and await her response!"" Jack hesitated. ""Approach her not as a boy, but as a man burdened by the past and the present, yet hopeful for a bright future ahead.""",1
"A dreadful act, undoubtedly, and I must admit to feeling a tinge of guilt in disclosing this to you, but the trials of finding a suitable apartment are well known."" I reassured her that I was fully cognizant of how the quest for living space often brings out the worst in people, and that the ruthless law of survival of the fittest always held true. ""And so we ascended, and can you imagine, the apartment was still available. The maid gave us a tour, we met the landlady, and the deal was struck on the spot. Immediate occupancy and fifty pounds for the furnishings. The contract was signed the following day, and we are scheduled to move in tomorrow!"" Mrs. Robinson concluded with a note of triumph.",1
"Bella's unexpected visit threw off his plans. He quickly got rid of her to proceed with his dark deeds. Binding and silencing Madame Renauld, he corrected past mistakes, leaving subtle clues behind. Disguised in an overcoat, he carried out the sinister act under the cover of darkness. The meticulous arrangement of the crime scene pointed directly at him. The final twist of fate came when he met his own demise. Despite the complex web of lies, Poirot unraveled the truth behind the elaborate scheme. The clever manipulation of evidence by the real culprits posed a challenge, but Poirot's keen insight prevailed. The intricate dance of deception and betrayal left a trail of devastation in its wake.",1
"I found myself at the mercy of my captor, an experience reminiscent of the dramatic scenes from “The Perils of Pamela.” The thrilling adventures I had once fantasized about were now unfolding before my eyes, but reality was proving to be far less entertaining. The words of Rayburn echoed in my mind, urging me to tell the truth. But would anyone believe the outlandish tale of how I ended up in this predicament? As I pondered my next move, my captor's menacing grin sent a shiver down my spine. I attempted to maintain a facade of confidence, mentioning my supposed whereabouts to buy some time. However, as the harsh reality of my situation set in, I knew that I was in for a long and arduous night.",1
"""But who could have done it?"" I asked, looking around the room for any clues. Poirot remained silent, a thoughtful look on his face. It was clear that he was deep in contemplation, trying to piece together the puzzle that lay before us. Suddenly, he spoke up. ""It must be someone close to the victim,"" he said, his eyes narrowing. I nodded, realizing the gravity of the situation. We were dealing with a cunning criminal, one who had managed to cover their tracks with precision. As we delved deeper into the case, I couldn't shake the feeling that the answer was right in front of us, waiting to be uncovered. The truth was out there, lurking in the shadows, and it was up to us to bring it to light.",1
"""I feel the need to go to Rhodesia after hearing your story, Colonel Race,"" Mrs. Blair stated. ""It's quite a dreadful journey though, five days in the train."" ""You should accompany me in my private car,"" I offered graciously, to which Mrs. Blair expressed her gratitude. In a sentimental tone, I mentioned South Africa and its treasures. Mrs. Blair and Miss Beddingfeld were captivated by the mention of diamonds. Colonel Race then recounted a fascinating story about a diamond robbery involving Sir Laurence Eardsley and his son. The tale stirred my new secretary, Rayburn, who appeared visibly moved. Anne Beddingfeld's curiosity about Rayburn was evident, prompting me to share a brief explanation.",1
"""Indeed, my dear friend, I am at a loss. My mind is clouded by the darkness of this situation,"" Poirot murmured, his hands deftly arranging his belongings in a small suitcase. ""I pray that we will be able to act in time, but the shadows grow deeper."" I watched as the Ministers departed, closing the door behind them. Turning to Poirot, I inquired urgently, ""What is your assessment of the situation?"" His response was measured, ""I am unable to draw a conclusion at this moment. My thoughts elude me."" Reflecting on the events, I suggested, ""Why resort to kidnapping when a simple blow to the head would suffice?"" Poirot corrected gently, ""Forgive me, my friend, but that was not quite my suggestion.""",1
"""She should have known better than to put it in writing, but I refrained from pointing that out. You carried out her instructions, visited the antique store, were led through the concealed passage from the rear chamber, and suddenly found yourself at the mercy of your foes!” Harry shot me a glance. I caught his meaning and subtly moved closer to Sir Eustace. “Indeed,” Sir Eustace murmured, “it seems luck is not on your side! Let me think, this marks, the third confrontation.” “You're correct,” Harry acknowledged. “This marks the third confrontation. Twice you have outsmarted me - have you not heard that luck changes on the third attempt? Now it's my turn - protect him, Anne.” I was prepared.""",1
"I trembled at the sight of Rayburn, the man with the scar who had just saved me from a dangerous attacker on the ship. As he turned to me with concern, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of relief that he was there to protect me. His presence was both comforting and intimidating, a stark contrast to the chaos that had just unfolded. My heart raced as I watched him deal with the fallen enemy, his actions swift and decisive. In that moment, I knew that I was in the presence of someone who would stop at nothing to keep me safe. And as we stood there on the deck, surrounded by darkness and uncertainty, I felt a sense of gratitude towards Rayburn, the unlikely hero who had come to my rescue.",1
"""Poirot was the one to reveal the shocking truth to Jack Renauld, causing a tumultuous reaction. With his mother's support, Jack faced the reality of his father's criminal past. Poirot assured Jack that the truth would remain hidden from the world. Eventually, Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and secretary. Poirot encouraged Jack to seek out the woman who loved him unconditionally, despite his father's history. Meanwhile, Captain Hastings contemplated joining the Renaulds on their new adventure. As Poirot and Hastings watched Miss Mary Marvell from the window, they realized she was simply being followed by adoring fans and not involved in any criminal drama.""",1
"""Shall we start?"" asked Poirot. ""Yes,"" Black replied nervously. Poirot took out his watch and placed it on the table. ""Let's begin. Day."" ""Night,"" Black responded. Poirot continued, ""Name."" ""Place."" ""Bernard."" ""Shaw."" ""Tuesday."" ""Dinner."" ""Journey."" ""Ship."" ""Country."" ""Uganda."" ""Story."" ""Lions."" ""Rook Rifle."" ""Farm."" ""Shot."" ""Suicide."" ""Elephant."" ""Tusks."" ""Money."" ""Lawyers."" Poirot explained his analysis to Hastings. He then spoke to Black, who confirmed a story about a suicide with a rook rifle on a farm. Poirot later broke the news to the widow, who was in denial. After dinner, a scream was heard, causing fear in the household. The door inexplicably opened, adding to the eerie atmosphere.",1
"”The heavy thud echoed from inside the room. Without hesitation, the key twisted in the lock and the door creaked open. Cinderella, visibly shaken, motioned for us to enter. “Is she unharmed?” Poirot inquired urgently. “Yes, I arrived just in time. She was barely conscious.” Mrs. Renauld lay on the bed, struggling for air. “She tried to strangle me,” she whispered through labored breaths. The young woman picked up an object from the ground and passed it to Poirot. It was a coiled silk rope ladder, delicate yet sturdy. “An escape plan,” Poirot concluded. “She intended to flee through the window while we forced the door. And the other?” The woman stepped back and silently pointed in response.”",1
"“The victim predicted his own demise? That certainly complicates things! But please, step inside.” He gestured towards the open gate, leading the way towards the house. As we walked, M. Bex filled us in: “The investigating magistrate, M. Hautet, needs to be informed immediately. He just wrapped up his examination of the crime scene and is preparing for the interrogations. A delightful man. You'll find him quite personable. Unconventional in his approach, but a fair arbiter.” Poirot inquired, “Do we know the time of death?” “The body was found this morning around nine o’clock. Testimonies from Madame Renauld and the medical experts suggest that the fatal incident likely took place around 2 a.",1
"The young woman, with a ghoulish mind, was fascinated by the gruesome details of the murder case. Despite my initial disapproval, I found myself reluctantly intrigued by her morbid curiosity. As we entered the shed where the body lay, her high spirits vanished, replaced by horror. She had ignored my warnings, and now she was paying the price. I showed her the victim's fatal wound, a dagger protruding from his back, which caused her to faint. Rushing to her aid, I fetched water and brandy to revive her, realizing that she had underestimated the reality of the crime scene. After she recovered, she begged me to take her away from the scene of death, shaken to her core by what she had witnessed.",1
"""Ridiculous!” “Not at all! Haven't you witnessed impersonators in music halls mimicking famous personalities with uncanny precision? It's a piece of cake to pretend to be someone in the public eye. The Prime Minister of England is a much simpler target to mimic than an average Joe like Mr. John Smith from Clapham. And as for O’Murphy’s doppelgänger, no one would have paid him any attention until after the Prime Minister had left, at which point he would have vanished. He travels from Charing Cross directly to his rendezvous with accomplices. He enters as O’Murphy, and exits as an entirely different person. O’Murphy has vanished into thin air, leaving behind a conveniently suspicious trail.""",1
"Mme. Renauld emerged in the doorway after a brief moment. Despite her resolve, her complexion was notably ashen. M. Hautet followed closely behind, offering sympathetic words in a flurry. She gestured for a pause. “Give me a moment, gentlemen, to compose myself.” After a deep breath, she removed her hand from her face and gazed at the lifeless body before her. The extraordinary composure she had displayed thus far crumbled in an instant. “Paul!” she wailed. “My dear husband! Oh, heavens!” With a sudden lurch, she collapsed to the floor in a faint. Without delay, Poirot rushed to her side, checking her vital signs with practiced ease. Once he confirmed her unconscious state, he stepped back.",1
"""But witnessing him standing there, pale and lifeless next to the wall, and listening to the incriminating confession escape from his mouth, all my doubts vanished. Poirot, however, directed his attention towards Giraud. “On what basis are you detaining him?” “Do I need to disclose that information to you?” “It would be appreciated as a gesture of respect,” insisted Poirot. Giraud hesitated, torn between outright refusal and the satisfaction of outsmarting his opponent. “You believe I have erred, don't you?” he taunted. “It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility,” Poirot retorted, a hint of mischief in his tone. A deeper shade of red crept onto Giraud's face. “Well then, step inside.""",1
"""Now, my dear Suzanne, we must act quickly and decisively. Pagett will remain here, which means you have the perfect opportunity to join us in Rhodesia,"" I said, gripping Suzanne's hand tightly. ""If you were there when he arrived, everything would fall into place naturally. And let's not forget about Colonel Race and Sir Eustace entirely."" Suzanne dimpled and replied, ""Surely you can't suspect them?"" ""I suspect everyone,"" I said mysteriously. ""In detective stories, the most unlikely person is often the culprit. Cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace have been known to be criminals."" Suzanne agreed to keep an eye on Sir Eustace and promised to send a telegram if he showed any suspicious changes.",1
"""The small grey matter always remembers the small grey matter, my friend!"" I settled into my chair, responding casually to Poirot's greeting by mentioning that a one-hour sea journey from Calais to Dover could hardly be considered ""terrible."" Poirot vigorously disagreed, waving his egg-spoon to emphasize his point. ""Not at all! If in one hour one endures sensations and emotions of the utmost terror, one has truly lived! Does not one of your English poets suggest that time is measured not by hours, but by heartbeats?"" ""I believe Browning was alluding to something more romantic than seasickness, however."" ""Because he was an Englishman, an islander for whom the English Channel meant nothing.""",1
"Colonel Race signaled with his hand. Arthur Minks, also known as the Rev. Edward Chichester and Miss Pettigrew, hesitantly stepped forward. Despite his pallor and nervous demeanor, he recounted, “I encountered Nadina in Paris the evening prior to her departure for England. At that time, I was assuming the identity of a Russian Count. She confided in me about her intentions. Although I cautioned her against it, fully aware of the individual she was dealing with, she disregarded my warning. A wireless message lay on the nearby table, which I proceeded to peruse. Subsequently, I contemplated making an attempt for the diamonds myself. However, in Johannesburg, I was approached by Mr. Rayburn.""",1
"I detest the idea of being hungry, though I am not concerned for my safety. Smuts will handle the revolution capably. But oh, how I long for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will remember to bring a bottle of whisky when he comes tomorrow? I threw on my hat and headed out, planning to purchase a few souvenirs. The curio shops in Jo’burg are quite charming. While examining a window full of luxurious karosses, a man exiting the shop bumped into me. To my surprise, it was Race. He didn't seem pleased to see me, but I insisted he accompany me back to the hotel. I tire of only having Miss Pettigrew to converse with. ""I had no clue you were in Jo’burg,"" I said conversationally. ""When did you arrive?""",1
"""Did you notice Sir Eustace?"" I inquired. ""He stormed out of the dining area as we entered. He seemed to have eaten some spoiled fish and was expressing his dissatisfaction to the head waiter, even going so far as to bounce a peach on the ground to demonstrate its hardness, though it turned out to be softer than he anticipated and ended up getting squashed."" Suzanne grinned. ""Sir Eustace is not a fan of early mornings, much like myself. But, Anne, did you catch sight of Mr. Pagett? I bumped into him in the hallway. He had a bruised eye. What on earth could have happened to him?"" ""Perhaps he was attempting to push me into the water,"" I responded nonchalantly. It was a small victory for me.",1
"""Isn't it rather the case of you being here without him, like a cart without a horse?"" His ill-timed jest lingered in the air as I made my way to the house. The door was opened by a middle-aged woman in black. I explained Mr. Havering's delay and my purpose there. She led me inside, closing the door behind us. The events of last night unfolded in her retelling - a mysterious man, a shot, and Mr. Pace left bleeding. The man with the black beard had vanished through the window before help arrived. Mrs. Havering was informed of my presence and descended the stairs promptly. Her vibrant presence was undeniable, even in the midst of tragedy. I introduced myself and she nodded in understanding.",1
"""The discussion that Foscatini was going to have with these gentlemen seemed very unusual,"" Graves explained. The murder took place at 8:47, indicated by a clock that had stopped at that exact time. The victim's face was described in detail, revealing his olive complexion and distinctive features. Inspector concluded that the case was straightforward, with Signor Ascanio as the main suspect. Ascanio's alibi was later confirmed by the Italian Ambassador, leading to his release. Poirot, however, was not convinced and decided to confront Ascanio about his involvement in the murder. Ascanio, feeling threatened by Poirot, eventually confessed to visiting Foscatini on the morning of the murder.",1
"""The woman's early discovery of the theft disrupted her carefully laid plans. No doubt, the culprits are present. One of them must have concealed the stolen items, and it seems highly improbable that the chambermaid would be involved."" ""More than improbable, downright impossible!"" Poirot interjected calmly. The inspector looked puzzled. Poirot smiled modestly. ""Allow me to demonstrate. Hastings, my dear friend, please hold my watch carefully. It is a precious family heirloom! I meticulously timed Mademoiselle's movements - her first absence lasted twelve seconds, while her second lasted fifteen. Now, observe my movements. Madam, would you kindly provide me with the key to the jewel case.""",1
"“Altitude seems to be doing wonders for me.”“Fresh air is truly invigorating,” remarked Colonel Race, with a smile.“Being cooped up in those cramped cabins would be the end of anyone,” Mrs. Blair stated, as she settled into a seat beside me and dismissed her companion with a slight nod.“Do you have an exterior cabin?” she inquired.I shook my head.“My dear, why not switch? There are plenty of vacancies. Many passengers disembarked at Madeira, and the ship is quite sparse. Have a word with the purser. He’s quite accommodating - he moved me to a lovely cabin because I wasn’t satisfied with the one I had. Speak with him during lunch when you head downstairs.”I felt a chill run down my spine.",1
"I climbed the stairs, determined to locate the room where the tragedy had unfolded. The rain from the day the body was found had left muddy footprints all over the uncarpeted floor. I doubted the police would have found any clues the day after, given the fine weather. The room itself was unremarkable, with white walls and a bare floor. Despite my thorough search, I found nothing of interest, until my pencil rolled under a window seat. Opening the cupboard underneath, I discovered a roll of Kodak films that piqued my interest. The films smelled strongly of mothballs, leading me to believe they belonged to the man killed in the Tube. This discovery gave me a new lead to pursue in the case.",1
"I was immediately suspicious and discovered that he was actually sailing for England on the Kilmorden Castle. I transformed myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age to avoid detection. Following him to London, he met Anita Grünberg, whom I hated for ruining my life. She left the agent's office with an order for the Mill House in Marlow. I trailed them to Knightsbridge, where she went to the Hyde Park Hotel. I followed Carton into the Tube station and tried to confront him, leading to a fatal accident. Realizing the danger I was in, I attached myself to Sir Eustace Pedler as his secretary. The identity of the 'Colonel' remained a mystery, but the search for the truth continued.",1
"Intrigued by the mysterious case of the stolen Naval plans, Poirot embarks on a daring plan to uncover the truth. As he and Hastings move into a flat in Montagu Mansions, they soon discover that there is more to their new neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, than meets the eye. With a cleverly devised scheme involving descending through the coal-lift, Poirot sets the stage for an unexpected turn of events. The following day, as Poirot shares the details of the stolen plans and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the deaths of Luigi Valdarno and Miss Elsa Hardt, Hastings realizes that they are about to embark on a thrilling adventure that will test their wits and courage to the fullest.",1
"“I thought you were my assistant,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. Thursday night. We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond heist all over again. Why are women so fascinated by anything to do with diamonds? Finally, Anne Beddingfeld has revealed her true identity. It turns out she’s a journalist. She sent a lengthy cable from De Aar this morning. Based on the non-stop chatter that echoed through Mrs. Blair’s cabin almost all night, she must have been reciting all her exclusive articles for years to come.",1
"Poirot and I arrived in Saint-Omer, ready to face the grim reality of Jack Renauld's imprisonment. The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, welcomed us warmly, expressing his concern for Madame Renauld's well-being. As we discussed the case, Poirot remained cautious, unwilling to reveal his true thoughts about the situation. The magistrate shared his frustrations with Jack's lack of defense, leaving us all puzzled by his silence. Despite the challenges ahead, I trusted in Poirot's abilities to uncover the truth and bring justice to those involved. We left the magistrate's office with a sense of foreboding, knowing that the mystery surrounding Jack Renauld's arrest was far from being solved.",1
"“Good gracious, we’ve certainly surprised the poor man!” she exclaimed to an invisible crowd. “I beg your pardon for my outburst! Quite improper, I know, but my goodness, the circumstances warrant it! Can you believe I’ve misplaced my sole sibling?”“Is that so?” I responded courteously. “What a dreadful situation.”“He is disapproving!” the woman declared. “He wholeheartedly disapproves of me, and my sister, which is unjust, considering he has yet to meet her!” I started to speak, but she cut me off.“Enough said! No one cares for me! I shall retire to the orchard and devour earthworms! Oh woe is me! I am devastated!” With that, she disappeared behind a large, whimsical Italian magazine.",1
"“I could have sworn it was the master, the resemblance was uncanny.” Mrs. Maltravers jumped in fear, reminding me of the old belief that spirits of suicides are restless. She seemed to share the same thought, as moments later she grabbed Poirot's arm in a panic. ""Did you not hear that? Three taps on the window? That was his signature signal when he roamed the premises."" ""It was just the ivy brushing against the glass,"" I interjected. However, an unsettling fear began to grip us all. The parlourmaid was visibly shaken, and after dinner, Mrs. Maltravers begged Poirot to delay his departure. She was clearly petrified at the thought of being alone. We all gathered in the cozy morning-room.",1
"""Was the man pleased or chagrined? It was unclear. He simply asked Marchaud: “Do you have the other one?” “Yes, sir.” “Then bring her in.” “The other” referred to Madame Daubreuil. She entered angrily, vehemently protesting. “I object, sir! This is an outrage! What is my involvement in all of this?” “Madame,” Giraud said harshly, “I am not investigating one murder, but two! You could be responsible for both for all I know.” “How dare you?” she exclaimed. “How dare you accuse me with such a baseless claim! It is scandalous.” “Scandalous, you say? And what about this?” Bending down, he once again picked up the hair, displaying it. “Do you recognize this, madame?” He moved closer to her.""",1
"""I do not threaten you with the gallows, but with the power of publicity. Your only chance is to be honest with me, Signor. I know you came to England to see Count Foscatini. You visited him on Tuesday morning and paid him a large sum of money for certain papers. The money was in Italian notes of small denomination. You left with the papers and never saw him again. When asked about the events of the evening, you claim someone must have impersonated you. But remember, the window-curtains were not drawn that evening, and it was still light outside at eight o'clock in June. Does that trigger any memories for you? Your story aligns with what I had suspected, Signor Ascanio. Good morning.""",1
"""Pardon me, sir?"" Poirot inquired. ""Do you possess knowledge of your mother's true identity?"" Marthe stared at him briefly before breaking down in tears, her head sinking onto her arms. ""There, there,"" consoled Poirot, giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. ""Compose yourself, my dear, it seems you are aware. Now, a follow-up question, were you acquainted with M. Renauld?"" Marthe lifted her head, looking at him with confusion. ""M. Renauld,"" she repeated, puzzled. ""Ah, I perceive you are unaware of that. Allow me to explain."" Poirot proceeded to dissect the case, similar to how he had briefed me before our journey to England. Marthe listened intently, captivated by his every word.",1
"I believed I was being clever as I followed him through the swaying portières. Suzanne put up a fight, but eventually agreed to carry out my plan. I arrived at my destination early the next morning and was met by a Dutchman with a car. As we drove, the sound of guns grew closer. Eventually, we arrived at a rundown building and I was ushered in to see Mr. Harry Rayburn, who seemed to recognize me. He questioned why I had fallen into the trap again, but I remained composed. Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew tried to get down to business, but I insisted on speaking with Sir Eustace Pedler. After a brief exchange, I was led to Sir Eustace, who greeted me warmly and admitted to being the 'Colonel'.",1
"""The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve."" The chauffeur thanked him and started the car once more. My gaze was captivated by the woman who remained standing, her hand resting on the gate, observing us. A true epitome of beauty, she was impossible to overlook. Towering in stature, possessing the allure of a youthful deity, her shimmering golden locks glistening in the sunlight, I silently acknowledged her as one of the most exquisite women I had ever beheld. As we ascended the rugged path, I glanced back in her direction. ""Goodness, Poirot,"" I remarked, ""did you catch sight of that stunning young woman?""",1
"Poirot and Japp were discussing the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Davenheim. Japp revealed that they found Mr. Davenheim's clothes near the lake, but not his body. They also arrested a suspect named Lowen, who was seen near the study on the day of the disappearance. Additionally, a man named Billy Kellett pawned Mr. Davenheim's ring in London. Poirot doubted that Lowen was the murderer, citing lack of evidence. He suggested that the ring may have been removed from the body to divert suspicion. Japp mentioned a lime kiln near the lake where the body could have been disposed of. Poirot then made a startling revelation about Mr. Davenheim's true whereabouts, leaving everyone in shock.",1
"We proceeded to our destination, a prime target in the affluent northern suburbs of London. Upon arrival at a grand and imposing house set back from the main road, Norman and I remained by the car while Poirot and a detective approached the entrance and pressed the doorbell. A poised parlourmaid answered the door, only to be met with the detective's authoritative declaration of their intent to search the premises. The maid let out a gasp, prompting a sophisticated, mature woman to emerge from the shadows of the hallway. ""Quick, Edith, close the door. These must be intruders,"" she exclaimed. Without hesitation, Poirot wedged his foot in the doorway and blew a sharp blast on a whistle.",1
"“Last time we met,” I began, “you were walking back with your sister, such a well-behaved child. Speaking of which, how is she doing?” A gleaming smile was my answer. “Thank you for asking! My sister is in good health.” “Is she accompanying you today?” “No,” the minx replied haughtily. “She decided to stay in town.” I chuckled. “I highly doubt you even have a sister. And if you do, her name must be Harris!” “Do you recall mine?” she inquired, a smirk playing on her lips. “Cinderella. But now you'll reveal your true name, won't you?” She shook her head mischievously. “Not even for why you're here?” “Ah, that! I assume you've heard about individuals in my line of work taking a break.”",1
"He meticulously constructs his argument, like a sculptor chiseling away at stone, with painstaking dedication. However, the details he focuses on may not align with my own intentions; he might overlook the significance of the very clues I am after. Let us commence."" Poirot systematically and precisely sifted through each compartment, inspecting the items within before carefully replacing them. It was a tedious and uneventful process. Poirot sifted through shirts, trousers, and shoes. A faint hum from outside caught my attention. Suddenly, I was filled with a sense of urgency. ""Poirot!"" I exclaimed. ""A vehicle has just arrived. Giraud has arrived with Jack Renauld and two policemen.""",1
"” Adventuresses should never be too rigid in their approaches. The plan succeeded. A servant in powdered wig accepted the card and took it away. Soon a timid secretary showed up. I engaged in a verbal sparring match with him and emerged victorious. He left in defeat. Shortly after, he returned and implored me to follow him. I complied. I found myself in a spacious chamber, a frightened shorthand typist hurried past me as if a ghostly apparition. The door closed behind me, leaving me alone with Lord Nasby. A formidable figure. Large head. Broad face. Thick moustache. Stout belly. I composed myself. I had not intended to focus on Lord Nasby's physique. He was already shouting at me.”",1
"“Did Renauld come by? I hold a great deal of respect and fondness for that woman; she’s an incredibly remarkable and unique individual, but I fail to see how my opinions, one way or another, could impact her?” “What if this Bella Duveen turns out to have been more than just a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” Stonor exclaimed. “I understand now. But I am willing to wager that you are mistaken. The old man never even glanced at another woman. He was completely devoted to his wife. They were the most loyal couple I have ever known.” M. Hautet shook his head subtly. “M. Stonor, we have concrete evidence of a love letter from this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of growing tired of her.”",1
"“What is your take on that?” I remained silent. I chuckled. Deep down, I was aware of the imminent danger. In that moment, he despised me. Yet, I found myself drawn to the danger, reveling in the sensation of his hands around my throat. I wouldn't trade that moment for anything else. With a brief chuckle, he let go of me. ""What's your name?"" he inquired abruptly. ""Anne Beddingfeld."" ""Is there nothing that scares you, Anne Beddingfeld?"" ""Oh, indeed,"" I responded, trying to appear composed despite feeling otherwise. ""Wasps, snarky women, overly young men, cockroaches, and condescending store clerks."" He chuckled briefly once more. Then, he nudged the unconscious Pagett with his foot.",1
"I had never seen anything quite like Cinderella. Her obsession with morbid excitement was palpable, overshadowing her youthful appearance. Despite her beauty, there was a ghoulish aspect to her that gave me pause. As we explored the crime scene together, she displayed a brashness that both intrigued and unsettled me. The discovery of the victim's body seemed to have a profound effect on her, stripping away her carefree demeanor to reveal a raw vulnerability. It was a stark reminder of the darkness that lurks beneath the surface, waiting to be unearthed. In that moment, she was no longer the daring girl I had known, but a frightened soul seeking solace in a world haunted by shadows.",1
"I turned away in disgust at the girl's ghoulish excitement. It made me wonder about the modern woman's obsession with morbid sensation. Despite her beauty, I couldn't shake my disapproval. The lady challenged me, saying women are no longer the delicate creatures of the past. She convinced me to show her around, hinting at the possibility of a big scoop for the papers. I hesitated, but her soft hand in mine was my undoing. We went first to where the body was found, then cautiously approached the Villa. I led her to the back where the shed was located, hoping to avoid any unwanted encounters. I left her hidden in the shrubbery as I entered the house, the voices inside growing louder.",1
"I will reveal everything. A man in Italy had incriminating information and demanded a large sum of money for it. I traveled to England to settle the matter. Meeting the man, I paid him in Italian notes for the papers. He gave them to me and I never saw him again. When arrested, I denied any involvement. I believe someone impersonated me that evening. No money was found in the flat. Poirot seemed puzzled, mentioning the window-curtains and coffee stains. He deduced that Graves orchestrated the whole scene, even staging a fake dinner party. Poirot's deduction impressed me, as always. Miss Violet Marsh visited Poirot with a unique request, detailing her family history from Devonshire.",1
"I gasped in shock as I saw her standing there, a suppressed shriek escaping her lips. It was Cinderella, my friend from the train. The surprise was mutual as we both exclaimed in unison. ""You!"" she cried, her eyes wide. ""My only Aunt!"" I replied, taken aback. ""What are you doing here?"" The conversation quickly turned playful as we bantered back and forth, reminiscing on past encounters. Cinderella's mischievous smile never faded as she revealed her love for crimes and mysteries. I couldn't help but be intrigued by her eagerness to explore the crime scene at the Villa Geneviève. Despite my reluctance, she insisted on tagging along, eager to see all the details of the investigation.",1
"It truly seemed as if Jack was careening towards his inevitable fate, with no regard for the consequences. I understood the urgent need he felt to hide the existence of a second dagger in the case, all for the sake of protecting Bella. As long as it was believed that there was only one weapon involved, suspicion would not fall upon the girl who had possessed the second paper-knife. Jack was bravely shielding his former lover, but it was becoming increasingly clear to me the great sacrifice he was making. The enormity of the challenge I had assigned to Poirot was beginning to dawn on me. It would be no simple feat to prove Jack Renauld's innocence without revealing the whole truth.",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer, took her final bow on stage, accepting praise from the Manager. After the performance, she received a visit from Count Sergius Paulovitch, who congratulated her on her success. As they conversed in English, Nadina revealed a secret to the Count - she possessed diamonds that could be used to blackmail their chief, the 'Colonel.' The Count warned her of the dangers of blackmailing such a man, but Nadina remained confident in her plan. She disclosed that her husband, who was arriving from Africa, was also involved in their scheme to confront the 'Colonel.' Despite the Count's doubts, Nadina was resolute in her decision to take on their powerful adversary.",1
"Upon showing Ridgeway’s card, we were escorted through a maze of counters and desks, maneuvering around clerks both taking and giving money, until we reached a small office on the second floor where we were greeted by the joint general managers. These two men were serious individuals, their years of service evident in their grey hair. One of them, Mr. Vavasour, sported a short white beard while the other, Mr. Shaw, was cleanly shaven. “I hear you specialize in discreet inquiries,” remarked Mr. Vavasour. “That is correct. We are also working closely with Scotland Yard on this matter. Inspector McNeil is overseeing the investigation, a highly skilled detective, as I understand it.”",1
"""As far as I know, Sir Eustace, he believes so and he must have the knowledge to confirm that."" ""By the way, where is he?"" I questioned. ""I haven't seen him since we got on board."" ""He claims to be unwell, and remains in his cabin, Sir Eustace."" Pagett's voice lowered once more. ""But I'm certain that's a cover. So he can observe better."" ""Observe?"" ""For your protection, Sir Eustace. In case there's an attempt on your life."" ""You're such a ray of sunshine, Pagett,"" I remarked. ""I hope your mind doesn't run wild. If I were you, I'd attend the party dressed as a grim reaper or a hangman. It matches your gloomy appearance."" That silenced him temporarily. I headed to the upper deck.""",1
"""Given the later time of the crime, suspicion is deflected from the culprit. An interruption by Bella causes frustration and hastens his actions. Madame Renauld is bound and gagged, a mistake from the past corrected. The culprit's escape route is staged, leading to their own demise. The investigation unravels two crimes, one solved and the other a deeper mystery. Poirot's methodical approach triumphs over Giraud's incompetence. Madame Renauld's strength and deception to protect her son are commendable. The lead piping serves a sinister purpose, revealing the true killer. The focus shifts to Jack Renauld as the prime suspect. The mystery deepens with the discovery of the dagger.""",1
"“Let us enter, sir.” “Do you have our associates unharmed?” “Yes, they are safe. However, they were not in possession of the items.” “I understand. So you have come to conduct a search. I am preparing to leave with Hastings, but before I go, I would like to share some insights on the history and behaviors of the household cat.” “Goodness gracious, have you lost your mind?” “The cat,” Poirot announced, “was revered by the ancient Egyptians. Even today, it is believed to be a sign of good fortune if a black cat crosses your path. Tonight, this cat has crossed your path, Japp. To discuss the inner workings of any creature or individual is, I realize, considered impolite in England.",1
"He was impeccably attired in a deep navy suit, impeccably tailored yet showing signs of wear. His contorted face revealed the agony he must have endured before his untimely demise. A gleaming black dagger protruded from his left side, directly over his heart. To my horror, I realized it was the same weapon I had seen the day before, resting innocently in a glass jar. ""The doctor will be here soon,"" Giraud stated calmly. ""But really, there's no need. It's quite clear how this man met his end. He was stabbed through the heart, a fatal blow that would have killed him instantly."" I inquired about the timing of the murder. ""Was it last night?"" Giraud shook his head. ""No, not likely.""",1
"""I was well aware of the terms of my father's will,"" the young man confirmed. ""Half of his fortune was left to me, while the other half was put in trust for my mother until her passing."" The magistrate instructed him to continue his narrative. The young man described a heated argument with someone, culminating in a realization that he was in danger of missing his train to Paris. In a rush, he made it to the station and boarded the train, his anger eventually subsiding. He later wrote a letter to Marthe, detailing the confrontation, and found solace in her reassuring response. She reminded him to stay resolute, as any obstacles would eventually crumble under their determination.",1
"""I always knew this day would come,"" she said with a hint of sadness in her voice. ""Mother,"" pleaded the boy. ""Please, give her a chance. Marthe is not only beautiful, but kind-hearted as well. What more could you ask for?"" ""I have no personal vendetta against Miss Daubreuil,"" she replied coldly. ""But I would much rather see you with an English bride. Or, if she must be French, then not from a family with such questionable background."" The bitterness in her tone was unmistakable, revealing the deep animosity she held towards the woman who threatened to steal her son's heart. It was clear that the idea of her son falling for the daughter of her enemy was a hard pill to swallow.",1
"""Rest assured, peace of mind will not come easily,” “Very well, I concur! You mention my disrespectful demeanor towards you. Well, on a few occasions, your behavior has irked me.” “I am pleased to hear it,” Poirot responded. “Good day, M. Giraud. Let's go, Hastings.” Walking in silence, my heart weighed heavily. Poirot had made his intentions glaringly clear. Doubts grew about my ability to rescue Bella from the aftermath of her actions. The unexpected encounter with Giraud had provoked Poirot and heightened his determination. Suddenly, a hand rested on my shoulder, and I turned to find Gabriel Stonor. We exchanged greetings and he suggested a leisurely walk back to our hotel.",1
"Mrs. Blair has been cooperating with us since the beginning. I got the note dictated by you, it was just as I anticipated. Race and I had already talked about the possibility of a hidden passage in the curio shop, and he had found where the exit was located.” Suddenly, there was a loud ripping noise, followed by a powerful blast that reverberated through the room. “They're bombing this part of the city. I need to get you out of here, Anne.” A sudden burst of light illuminated the scene as the house across the street went up in flames. Sir Eustace stood up and began pacing back and forth. Harry aimed the gun at him, keeping him in check. “It's over, Sir Eustace, the jig is up.”",1
"I have been a professional in this business since my youth, always employing experts to carry out my schemes. Nadina was an exception, knowing too much for me to trust her. After her death, with the diamonds in my possession, I felt safe. However, I now realize that I made mistakes, especially in involving that fool Pagett. He may have a curious face and a traditional soul, but my sense of humor led me to keep him around. My dear Anne, never let your sense of humor cloud your judgment. I have always known it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but his work ethic made it hard to find a reason to let him go. As for you, my dear, the question remains: where are the diamonds now?",1
"""But why the delay? What is holding you back?” “I am awaiting the arrival of the Olympia. She is scheduled to return from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you already know the identity of the bond thief, why the hesitation? He might elude capture.” “Escape to a remote South Sea island with no extradition laws? No, my friend, life would be far from pleasant for him there. As for the reason behind my waiting, well, to the keen intellect of Hercule Poirot the solution is crystal clear, but for those less astute like Inspector McNeil, it may be prudent to conduct some inquiries to confirm the details. It is important to show compassion for those who lack the same level of insight.”",1
"“Kids these days are always looking for trouble,” he remarked disdainfully. “They don't think before they act, just relying on their strength. Let's be rational here. Right now you may have the advantage, but that won't last. My men are all over this house. You don't stand a chance. Your temporary control is just luck.” “Oh really?” Harry's tone of voice caught Sir Eustace's attention, a hint of dark humor in his words. Sir Eustace peered at him. “Really?” Harry repeated. “Take a seat, Sir Eustace, and hear me out.” Keeping his gun pointed at him, he continued, “Luck is not on your side this time. First off, listen to that!” A muffled thud could be heard from the door below.",1
"""They are merely new acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t suspect for a moment” Poirot gestured with his hand. “Hold on, my friend. Have I made any assumptions? All I am saying is it's an intriguing tale. And there is no clue to unravel it; except maybe the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?” “Her name is Stella,” I said firmly, “but I fail to see” Poirot cut me off with a hearty laugh. Something appeared to be greatly amusing him. “And Stella means a star, correct? Brilliant!” “What in the world” “And stars provide illumination! There you have it! Relax, Hastings. Spare me the wounded pride. Come, let us head to Montagu Mansions and conduct a few investigations.""",1
"As I stepped out of the train onto Adderly Street, a sense of unease settled over me. I could feel the eyes of my watcher boring into the back of my head, a constant reminder of the danger that surrounded me. I knew I couldn't continue to play the game alone - my enemies were too numerous and too close. The time had come to change my tactics. Sitting down at Cartwright's, I ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas, finding solace in the sweet, cold liquid as I contemplated my next move. A man might have turned to a stiff drink for courage, but for me, the comfort of an ice-cream soda was enough to steady my nerves. With each sip, I steeled myself for the challenges that lay ahead.",1
"""Imagine this scenario: he wakes up and catches a glimpse of me vanishing into the distance. Wouldn't he automatically assume that I was the one who attacked him? Especially since he already suspected me of following him?” “It’s a possibility,” I responded thoughtfully. “But it changes our entire perspective. And there are other factors to consider.” “Most of them have logical explanations. The individual who trailed you in Cape Town interacted with Pagett, who then checked his watch. Perhaps the man simply wanted to know the time.” “So, it was just a random occurrence?” “Not quite. There seems to be a calculated strategy at play here, linking Pagett to the whole incident.""",1
"“Not a word was shared with me. We never had that kind of relationship. But he was clearly agitated and quite shaken!” “Interesting,” remarked Detective Jones. “Do you have any idea what might have caused this?” “As I mentioned before, I do not, sir.” “I’m sorry, but we must go through some formalities. What is your name?” “My name is Alexander Moretti.” “When did you start working as Mr. Renauld’s assistant?” “It was roughly two years back, right after his return from South America. I was introduced to him by a friend, and he offered me the job. He was an excellent boss, I must say.” “Did he share much about his life in South America with you?” “Yes, quite a bit actually.”",1
"Poirot and I hurried to Saint-Omer to meet M. Hautet, the examining magistrate. We were ushered into his room, where he expressed his relief that Poirot had not actually returned to England. M. Hautet lamented the skill of Giraud, the detective, and his certainty of Jack Renauld's guilt. Poirot, however, remained unconvinced, citing various obscure points in the case. When asked about Jack's defense, M. Hautet revealed his frustration with Jack's silence during questioning. The magistrate also shared concerns about Madame Renauld's fragile mental state after the tragic events. As the conversation turned to a letter for Poirot, I couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom.",1
"""He managed to get the case dismissed, but it ruined two young men and left them to face the world as thieves. It devastated the old man, leading to a bitter confrontation with his son. The son, silent and proud, enlisted in the war with his friend, who ended up losing his life due to recklessness. The old man, revealing his bitterness towards a woman, took on a new identity and lived a numb existence on an island. But when he encountered a man who recognized him, he was stirred back to life. The man revealed his involvement in the robbery, his marriage to the woman, and the hidden diamonds. The old man, determined to clear his name, followed the man to England on a boat.""",1
"""His words seemed to lack clarity, filling me with uneasiness. However, his demeanor was that of normalcy. Abruptly, he got up and casually walked over to the window. ""There he is,"" he remarked. ""Who?"" I inquired. ""M. Jack Renauld. I sent a message to the Villa requesting his presence here."" This revelation shifted my thoughts, prompting me to question Poirot about Jack Renauld's presence in Merlinville on the night of the crime. Hoping to outsmart my clever companion, I was disappointed to find that he was already aware. Just like me, he had checked at the station. ""It seems we are not the only ones with this idea, Hastings. The admirable Giraud has likely done the same.""",1
"“You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this attachment, madame.” “I feared it,” she replied simply. “Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is beautiful. What can you have against her?”",1
"As I watched the tall young man approaching, his lean, deeply bronzed face caught my attention. It spoke of a life in a tropic clime. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered upon seeing him, her face noticeably blanched. ""You,"" she gasped. ""I thought you were on your way to East Africa."" The young man explained that news from his lawyers had detained him, as his uncle in Scotland had unexpectedly left him some money. At that moment, Poirot stepped forward, making introductions and emphasizing our imminent return to London. We quickly made our way to the Anchor Inn where Captain Black was staying, ready to investigate his connection to the events surrounding Mr. Maltravers' death.",1
"He's like the rest of them, spouting inflammatory speeches for political gain only to backtrack later. I encountered him as he was heading to Cape Town to defend himself in a lengthy Dutch speech. The endless droning in the South African Legislative Assembly made me grateful for the brevity of the House of Commons. But trouble was brewing, with arms and explosives flowing in under the guise of vegetables. The mastermind behind it all was rumored to be in Johannesburg. Despite warnings and offers of safe passage, I refused to be whisked away to Pretoria. Instead, I received a surprising telegram confirming Anne's safety in Kimberley. Her resilience never ceases to amaze me.",1
"Papa’s friends were all renowned Professors, distinguished by their long beards. One of them, Professor Peterson, once made a rather inappropriate comment about Anne's figure. Anne, yearning for adventure and romance, found solace in the village's lending library and the weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela” at the Kinema. Her father's sudden excitement over an antique skull found in Northern Rhodesia sparked a new adventure. Unfortunately, Papa's health took a turn for the worse, and he passed away, leaving Anne practically penniless. Mr. Flemming, Papa's solicitor, offered Anne a temporary stay in London, setting the stage for new beginnings and unexpected challenges.",1
"“Can I interest you in something unique? Exotic furs, rare curios?” “I'm looking for something truly extraordinary,” I replied. “It's for a special event. Can you show me what you have?” “Would you care to step into my private showroom? We house a variety of exclusive items there.” That's where I made a critical error. I thought I was being so clever. I followed him past the beaded curtains. (Anne’s Story Continues) Dealing with Suzanne was a challenge. She argued, she begged, she even cried before reluctantly agreeing to go along with my scheme. Eventually, I convinced her to follow my instructions precisely, and she came to the train station to bid me a tearful goodbye.",1
"After careful consideration, it was decided that I would accompany Suzanne, no matter her location, and focus solely on my own well-being. It was imperative that I refrained from seeking out thrills or trying to outsmart the elusive “Colonel.” My task was to stay by her side and await further instructions from Harry. The precious diamonds were to be securely stored in the Bank at Kimberley under the alias of Parker. ""There's one aspect we must address,"" I pondered, ""we should establish a code of sorts. We must avoid falling for deceitful messages claiming to be from one another."" ""That's simple. Any communication legitimately from me will have the word 'and' crossed out.""",1
"We took a taxi to an address in St. John’s Wood. I was in the dark about our destination, not wanting to ask Poirot in front of our captive. We arrived at a small house where Poirot demanded to see a doctor for his ill wife. The man at the door refused, but Poirot was not deterred. After a scuffle, we all ended up inside the house, the door bolted behind us. Poirot led us into a room, instructing the Italian to hide behind a curtain just as a woman entered. She demanded to know where her husband was, only to be met by Poirot's cryptic words. The Italian emerged from hiding, wielding a revolver, causing the woman to scream and attempt to flee, only to be blocked by Poirot.",1
"""That appeared to rattle him quite a bit, and he mentioned that having a wife was extremely beneficial for a General Practitioner. The notion seemed even less romantic than previously, however there was a part of me that leaned towards agreeing to it. Security, that was what was being offered to me. Security and a Cozy Residence. Reflecting on it now, I think I misjudged the little man. He truly loved me, but a misguided sense of propriety held him back from pursuing me in that way. Nevertheless, my affection for adventure resisted. ""It's incredibly generous of you,"" I responded. ""But it's not feasible. I could never wed a man unless I was passionately in love with him.""",1
"""What do you mean by ‘vanish’? To which category of vanishing are you alluding?” “Are vanishings organized and categorized, then?” I chuckled. Japp grinned as well. Poirot scowled at us both. “But of course they are! They are divided into three groups: First, and most frequent, the deliberate vanishing act. Second, the often falsified ‘amnesia’ scenario, uncommon, but occasionally legitimate. Third, homicide, and the more or less effective disposal of the corpse. Do you consider all three as unattainable?” “Almost certainly, I would say. You may lose your own memory, but someone would surely identify you particularly in the instance of a prominent figure like Davenheim.”",1
"Rupert had disappeared into the darkness of New York once again, only to meet his end by his own hand. In the note he left behind, there were troubling words that hinted at a deep sense of regret. He described himself as an outcast and a pariah, ultimately concluding that death was his only escape. As I read the letter, a new suspicion crept into my mind. The ancient curse of an Egyptian pharaoh seemed unlikely - perhaps a more recent evil was at play. Could it be that this troubled young man sought to eliminate his uncle, but mistakenly poisoned Sir John Willard instead? The thought lingered in my mind, painting a chilling picture of a man tormented by his own misdeeds.",1
"And the inns suggest subtly that once the provisions run out, they will toss you onto the doorstep! Last evening, I encountered Reeves, my comrade from the Kilmorden. His nerves are shot worse than any other man I've come across. Like the rest of them, he delivers fiery speeches of great length, purely for political gain, only to regret it later. He's now running around claiming he never meant it. When I saw him, he was heading to Cape Town, where he plans to deliver a three-day speech in Dutch, defending himself and insisting that his previous statements had a completely different meaning. I am grateful that I'm not a member of the Legislative Assembly of South Africa.",1
"I wonder about this Chichester character who seems so innocent. Perhaps Pagett will have some insight. He always seems to know everything. The evening was quite eventful, with Mrs. Blair's refusal to dress up and Race's sudden chattiness after some champagne. I danced with various ladies, including Anne Beddingfeld, who looked stunning in her gipsy costume. As the night went on, I shared some entertaining lion stories, much to the amusement of the guests. It was a delightful evening, despite Pagett's absence and Reeves' presence. The South African Labour party member might come in handy for some information I seek. Overall, it was a night full of surprises and laughter.",1
"Having expressed my gratitude to Hassan and declining his offer of more coffee, we found ourselves alone once again. I lingered by the entrance of the tent, gazing out at the vast expanse of the desert after removing my clothes. ""This is truly a remarkable place,"" I remarked aloud, ""and an extraordinary undertaking. I sense the allure of it all. The existence in the desert, the exploration of a bygone civilization. Surely, Poirot, you also perceive the magic?"" Silence greeted my question, prompting me to turn around, feeling a twinge of irritation. But that irritation swiftly transformed into alarm. Poirot was sprawled on the makeshift bed, his face contorted in agony.",1
"I quickly retreated into the shadows, observing as the man conversed with Guy Pagett. Any lingering doubts I may have had were dispelled by this interaction. Pagett consulted his watch before the two exchanged a few words, after which the man made his way towards the station. It was clear that Pagett had given him instructions, but what were they exactly? Suddenly, my heart raced as the man who had been tailing me approached a policeman in the middle of the road. They engaged in a lengthy discussion, gesturing towards Cartwright's and appearing to explain something. It became clear to me - I was being set up for an arrest, likely on false charges such as pickpocketing.",1
"Mr. Poirot and I were waiting in the hotel room of the Opalsens. Mrs. Opalsen was weeping, her pearls missing. Mr. Opalsen paced angrily, while two police officials stood by. The chambermaid and the French maid were also present, both in distress. Mrs. Opalsen believed in luck, convinced that Poirot was the one to find her pearls. Poirot reassured her, promising to help. Mrs. Opalsen then recounted how she found her jewel-case empty after dinner, despite the room being locked and her maid present. The inspector suggested a duplicate key was used. Célestine, the maid, was horrified at the implication and turned to Poirot for help, disregarding the police's incompetence.",1
"""And once they finally comprehend each other, the love has already vanished."" ""Is it the same in reverse? Are those who constantly bicker truly in love?"" ""I'm not sure,"" I replied, feeling a bit disoriented. He shifted his focus to the fireplace. ""Care for more soup?"" he asked nonchalantly. ""Yes, please. I'm famished enough to devour a hippopotamus."" ""Excellent."" He tended to the fire while I observed. ""Once I can pry myself off this couch, I'll whip up a meal for you,"" I vowed. ""I doubt you know the first thing about cooking."" ""I can heat up canned goods just as well as you can,"" I shot back, gesturing towards a line of cans on the mantelpiece. ""Touché,"" he chuckled.",1
"""Have you noticed Pagett's shiner? I'm done with secretaries unless I find a nice girl with liquid eyes. What about you, Miss Anne? Will you come with me to Rhodesia?"" Sir Eustace asked. ""Thank you, but I must leave for Durban tonight,"" I replied. Despite my refusal, Sir Eustace insisted, mentioning lions in Rhodesia. As he called for Pagett, I hurried Suzanne to make plans. Suzanne expressed disappointment at not being able to go to Rhodesia, but I assured her she was still going. We discussed keeping an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race, with Suzanne even suggesting confiding in the latter. I objected, wary of the consequences of involving others in our adventure.",1
"""Magnificent, exquisite, magnificent,"" he exclaimed. ""Tonight, you have truly outdone yourself."" With a gallant gesture, he planted a kiss on each of her cheeks in a rather casual manner. Madame Nadina gracefully accepted the praise, a routine she had grown accustomed to, and made her way to the dressing room. The room was adorned with bouquets scattered haphazardly, modern garments hanging on hooks, and the air filled with a heady mix of floral scents and luxurious perfumes. Jeanne, the loyal dresser, attended to her mistress, chatting incessantly and showering her with exaggerated compliments. Suddenly, a knock at the door brought an abrupt halt to the conversation.",1
"Jack Renauld adamantly denied any knowledge of his father's potential enemies in Santiago or elsewhere in South America. He claimed to have seen no change in his father's behavior recently and insisted that his father had never mentioned anything about a secret. Renauld believed his father's trip to South America was purely related to business. When M. Hautet paused, Giraud interjected, expressing his desire to ask his own questions. The magistrate, with a hint of coldness, granted Giraud permission. Moving his chair closer to the table, Giraud inquired about Jack Renauld's relationship with his father, to which the young man arrogantly affirmed a positive connection.",1
"""I am certain of it,” declared Poirot calmly. “May I ask a few questions, on behalf of your nephew? Who was responsible for ordering this lock from Hubbs’s?” “I took care of it myself,” Mr. Shaw responded. “I did not want to leave it in the hands of a clerk. As for the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two were kept by my associate and I.” “Have any clerks had the opportunity to access them?” Mr. Shaw glanced at Mr. Vavasour for confirmation. “To my knowledge, they have remained untouched in the safe since we placed them there on the 23rd,” Mr. Vavasour stated. “Unfortunately, my associate fell ill two weeks ago, on the very day that Philip departed from us.""",1
"“Perhaps it has been here for quite some time. However, it holds no interest for me.” “On the contrary, I find it quite intriguing,” Poirot replied with a touch of sweetness. I suspected he was simply trying to provoke the Paris detective, and if that was his goal, he certainly achieved it. The other man turned away abruptly, stating that he was not willing to waste any more time. He then bent down to continue his thorough search of the area. Meanwhile, Poirot, as if struck by a sudden inspiration, stepped back across the boundary and tested the door of the small shed. “It's locked,” Giraud remarked without looking. “But it's only where the gardener stores his junk.”",1
"A large, faded chintz-covered settee was placed against the wall, while the window seats were also covered in the same pattern. Poirot, with his tiny cigarette, emphasized the need to carefully search the room for clues, especially in the desk. The key to the desk had a dirty envelope with a handwritten label, which Poirot found suspicious. The Bakers, sympathetic to Miss Violet, recalled the events surrounding the will signing. Poirot's investigation led to the discovery of a hiding place created by workmen from Plymouth, where a cavity was made beneath a brick in the fireplace. The cavity revealed crucial evidence, and Poirot wasted no time in examining it further.",1
"""I urge you not to part with it, George,"" she pleaded, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It holds generations of sentimental value."" She paused, anticipating a response, but met only silence which caused her expression to turn steely. With a nonchalant shrug, she remarked, ""I ought to go prepare myself. I suppose it's time to showcase 'the merchandise.'"" Casting a wry glance at Poirot, she added, ""It truly is one of the most atrocious necklaces to ever exist! George always talks of resetting the stones for me, yet it remains a mere promise."" And with that, she exited the room. Thirty minutes later, the trio convened in the grand drawing-room, awaiting her presence.",1
"She presented me with the promise of Madeira. A glimmer of hope emerged within me. The thought of stepping onto solid ground was enough to lift my spirits. Wrapped in layers of coats and blankets, my legs barely able to support me, I was lifted and placed on a deck chair like a lifeless body. I closed my eyes, filled with resentment towards existence. The purser, a young fair-haired man with an innocent face, approached and took a seat next to me. ""Feeling a bit sorry for yourself, are you?"" he inquired. ""Yes,"" I responded, my dislike for him growing. ""You'll feel like a new person in a day or two. We encountered rough weather in the Bay, but calmer seas lie ahead.""",1
"The juvenile members of the human species display certain characteristics resembling those of anthropoids, while the young chimpanzees exhibit similarities to humans more so than adult chimpanzees. This suggests that our predecessors had greater Simian traits than we do, whereas chimpanzees' ancestors were of a more advanced nature compared to the current species, implying that the chimpanzee is in decline. The resourceful publication, the Daily Budget, in need of sensational material, promptly published bold headlines. ""Are we the ancestors of monkeys, or are monkeys our descendants? Distinguished Professor claims chimpanzees are deteriorating versions of humans.""",1
"""I knew Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent. I helped him with a Japanese wrestler once. He might be able to help us find what we're looking for. It took a while to find Mr. Aarons, but he was willing to assist us. We asked for a young girl named Bella Duveen. Mr. Aarons recognized her as part of the Dulcibella Kids. He informed us that they were performing in Coventry. We headed there and watched their act, which received applause. After the show, Cinderella approached me, scared and in tears. She confessed to taking the dagger because she was afraid of fingerprints on it. I reassured her and confessed my love for her, promising not to turn her in to the police.""",1
"""Indeed,"" I replied with a heavy heart. ""I hold myself responsible for the tragic turn of events. My companion was deeply disturbed by what she witnessed, almost fainting on the spot. I provided her with brandy and water, then escorted her safely back to town. Unfortunately, in my haste, I neglected to secure the door until my return to the Villa."" The commissary interjected, ""So, for a minimum of twenty minutes..."" I nodded in agreement, ""Precisely, twenty minutes,"" confirming his observation. M. Hautet chimed in, his tone once again stern, ""This situation is truly lamentable, unprecedented."" Suddenly, a new voice entered the conversation, ""You express regret, M.",1
"But it would have been suicide, mon ami! The plan was well laid out. The chloroform to subdue, the morphine to finish. Madame Renauld was the target, but she fought back. Marthe Daubreuil had to improvise. No suicide, but a desperate attempt to escape. The truth came out, not by Poirot's hand, but by a young acrobat. I pondered, when did suspicion first arise? The answer was clear. Marthe's anxious eyes gave her away. She had a motive, a plan, but it all unraveled. Jack Renauld recovered, but Madame Daubreuil vanished. Secrets buried, truths revealed. Jack's future uncertain, but love may prevail. As for me, a new beginning awaits, far from the crimes of the past.",1
"Poirot glanced up at the staircase as he passed by, a look of dissatisfaction on his face. ""It's simply unbelievable that the servants didn't hear anything. The noise from three people coming down those stairs would have been enough to wake the dead!"" ""But it was the dead of night, they were fast asleep by then."" Despite this explanation, Poirot continued to shake his head, clearly not convinced. As he stopped to gaze at the house from the drive, he questioned, ""What made them think to check if the front door was unlocked in the first place? The odds of it being open were slim. It would have been much more logical for them to attempt to break in through a window.""",1
"The passage was dark and eerie, with only a faint light illuminating the room. Mrs. Maltravers let out a blood-curdling scream as she turned to Poirot. ""You saw him there in the passage?"" she cried out, her voice filled with terror. Poirot looked puzzled, shaking his head. ""Madame, I saw nothing. You must be imagining things."" But Mrs. Maltravers insisted, her voice growing more frantic. Suddenly, the lights flickered and went out, plunging the room into darkness. Three loud raps echoed through the room, causing Mrs. Maltravers to moan in fear. And then, as if materializing out of thin air, the figure of a man appeared before them, glowing with an unearthly light.",1
"Count Foscatini. It appears there has been an incident at his residence,” he said, catching the man off guard. “I was unaware of any such occurrence. Mr. Graves, who works for Count Foscatini, left not long ago and mentioned nothing of the sort,” the man replied. “Is the Count by himself in the apartment?” “No, he is currently dining with two other gentlemen,” the man answered. “What can you tell me about them?” I inquired eagerly as we rode the elevator to the second floor where Flat II was located. “I did not personally see them, sir, but I believe they were foreigners,” he responded. As we arrived at the landing, facing No. II, the doctor pressed the doorbell.",1
"“Even Hercule Poirot couldn't solve this one,” my friend chuckled. “I'm going to start the investigation now. Just had to make my case to you first. But mark my words, I'll be proven right; and once I've given Japp a heads up, he'll have enough to nab the upstanding Mr. Graves. I'm curious how much of the money he's already blown through.” Poirot's intuition was spot on, as always, curse him! The case brought to us by Miss Violet Marsh was a welcome departure from our usual mundane tasks. Poirot had received a concise and professional note from the woman requesting a meeting, to which he responded by setting up an appointment for eleven o'clock the next morning.",1
"""I heard Colonel Race is heading to Rhodesia as well,” Suzanne remarked, deep in thought. “If we could somehow get Sir Eustace to extend an invitation to him too.” “You can make it happen. You have a way with things,” I replied. “I adore butter,” Suzanne purred with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. We concluded our conversation with the understanding that Suzanne would utilize her skills to their fullest potential. Feeling too restless to retire for the night, I made my way up to the deck. Tomorrow morning, we would reach Table Bay. The breeze was invigorating, the boat gently swaying in the choppy waters. The deck was shrouded in darkness, devoid of any souls.",1
"""I still have a good amount of cash. Mrs. Flemming's twenty-five pounds is untouched, and I also won the sweepstakes yesterday, adding another fifteen pounds to my stash. I am sitting pretty with forty pounds!"" ""Forty pounds! Goodness!"" gasped Mrs. Blair. ""I couldn't do it, Anne, and I consider myself brave in my own way. I couldn't just set off cheerfully with a handful of coins and no plan of action or destination in mind."" ""But that's the thrill of it,"" I declared, feeling energized. ""It's the sense of adventure that makes it so exhilarating."" She gazed at me, nodded thoughtfully, and then broke into a smile. ""Lucky Anne! Not many share your outlook on life.""",1
"“Let’s play a little game,” Poirot suggested, fixing Black with a curious stare. “I will say a word, and you respond with the first word that comes to mind. Shall we start?” Black hesitated, but eventually agreed to participate. Poirot instructed Hastings to write down the words as they went along. With his watch set on the table, Poirot began. “Day.” Without much delay, Black replied, “Night.” The game continued with Poirot saying, “Name,” and Black responding with “Place.” As the words flowed, Poirot’s deductions sharpened. “Thank you, Captain Black. Can we speak in thirty minutes?” Black agreed, leaving Poirot to decipher the hidden meanings behind the words.",1
"""Perhaps if the ring were found nearby, one could argue that Davenheim himself had accidentally dropped it,"" Japp suggested. ""But why bother removing it from the body at all?"" I exclaimed. ""There could be a specific reason for that,"" Japp replied. ""Did you know that just past the lake, there's a small gate that leads to the hill? And within a three-minute walk, you'll find what? A lime kiln.""""Goodness!"" I gasped. ""So you're saying that the lime used to dispose of the body wouldn't harm the metal of the ring?""""Exactly,"" Japp confirmed. ""It appears to me,"" I remarked, ""that this clarifies everything. What a ghastly crime!"" Without a word, we both turned to Poirot.",1
"""What proof do we have that Ascanio and his accomplice, or two individuals impersonating them, actually visited the apartment that evening? No witnesses observed their entry or exit. Our only evidence comes from a solitary individual and an array of lifeless objects."" ""Are you suggesting?"" ""I am suggesting that the cutlery, dishes, and utensils speak volumes. It may have been a devious scheme, but Graves, despite his deceitful nature, is a master of organization. Having eavesdropped on part of the conversation earlier that day, he recognized Ascanio's vulnerable position. The next night, around eight o'clock, he fabricates an urgent phone call for his employer.""",1
"As he sat across from Anne, Harry's eyes darkened with the weight of his past. ""It was for my friend that I sought justice,"" he began, his voice heavy with emotion. ""His life was lost, his name tarnished by betrayal. I became a ghost, leaving behind the man I once was. But fate had other plans."" Anne listened intently as Harry recounted the events that led him to uncover the truth about Anita Grünberg and the elusive 'Colonel.' The revelation sparked a fire within him, propelling him on a journey to confront the shadows of his past. With determination in his heart, Harry embarked on a quest for redemption, guided by the ghosts of those he had lost along the way.",1
"""As for your inquiry, I am truly clueless."" ""Could you investigate?"" inquired Poirot persistently. ""Certainly, if you truly wish to know."" ""Thank you, my friend. I would appreciate it if you could look into it."" Japp gazed at him for a few more minutes, but Poirot appeared to have forgotten about us both. The detective sadly shook his head at me, and whispered, ""Poor old chap! The war has taken its toll on him!"" before gently exiting the room. While Poirot remained lost in thought, I grabbed a piece of paper and entertained myself by jotting down some notes. My companion's voice snapped me out of it. He had snapped out of his trance and looked lively and sharp.",1
"""Why did he choose yesterday to abruptly send the chauffeur on holiday? Was it because he wanted him out of the way before we arrived?"" Françoise had already exited the room. The magistrate sat silently, tapping his fingers on the table. After a moment, he spoke, ""M. Bex, we are faced with conflicting testimonies. Who should we trust, Françoise or Denise?"" The commissary didn't hesitate, ""Denise. She was the one who allowed the visitor to enter. Françoise's age and stubbornness have clouded her judgment, especially towards Madame Daubreuil. And our investigation suggests that Renauld was involved with another woman."" Suddenly, M. Hautet exclaimed, ""Well, well!""",1
"After enduring a nerve-racking crisis, she found herself facing the sea, a place she dreaded. With the enemy drawing closer each day, the situation seemed dire. Fortunately, her practical husband came to the rescue, unphased by her distress. Upon reaching England, she was left weak but alive. Poirot, with a serious expression, pointed out a flaw in the toast rack, exclaiming his disapproval. As I attempted to explain the shape of the toast, he dismissed my words with sarcasm. Reflecting on the lack of interesting cases, Poirot opened his letters, finding mostly bills. A note from Japp brought a slight glimmer of hope, thanking him for assistance in a past case.",1
"Enraged by what he perceived as mistreatment from his wife, driven by his intense love for her, a love he believed she reciprocated, he meticulously plotted the crime and delivered the fatal strike to liberate his beloved from a detestable marriage. It was only then that he discovered the existence of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and came to the realization that the woman he adored had deceived him! She didn't seek freedom for his sake, but rather to wed the affluent American. Feeling used and consumed by jealousy, he publicly accused her, claiming that he had only acted upon her wishes. In a surprising turn of events, Madame Beroldy displayed her undeniable brilliance.",1
"Mr. MacAdam, a weak-throated man, carefully preserved his voice before important speeches. The deception was maintained until reaching France, where it became impractical. The Prime Minister's disappearance led the police across the Channel, diverting attention from the initial attack. To maintain the illusion of the abduction in France, Daniels was effectively gagged and chloroformed. The impostor Prime Minister and his fake chauffeur were eventually released due to lack of evidence, while the real Prime Minister and O'Murphy sought refuge with 'Mrs. Everard' in Hampstead. Poirot's keen observation skills led him to uncover the truth, much to his satisfaction.",1
"The hallway was deserted. Without hesitation, I swiftly made my way to the door, opened it, and stepped out into the bright sunlight. I sprinted down the driveway with a sense of urgency. Once I reached the open road, I slowed my pace to a casual stroll. Onlookers gazed at me with curiosity, undoubtedly noting the layer of dust that clung to my face and clothes, evidence of my recent escapade in the attic. Eventually, I arrived at a nearby garage and entered. ""I've been in a bit of a mishap,"" I informed the attendant. ""I require a vehicle to transport me to Cape Town immediately. I have a ship to catch in Durban."" It wasn't long before my request was fulfilled.",1
"""Indeed, I was taken aback. I had assumed that Miss Anne would be actively involved here, gathering material for the Daily Gazette."" ""Kimberley,"" he muttered. The mere mention of it seemed to disturb him. ""There's nothing worth seeing there, the mines are no longer operational."" ""You know how women can be,"" I remarked vaguely. He shook his head and walked away. I seemed to have given him something to ponder. As soon as he left, my Government contact returned. ""I hope you don't mind me coming to you once more, Sir Eustace,"" he said apologetically. ""But there are a couple of things I would like to inquire about."" ""Of course, my friend,"" I responded with a smile.",1
"""Anne, it appears you've encountered your match. But remember, the path of righteousness doesn't always lead to victory."" Suddenly, the sound of splintering wood filled the air as footsteps thundered up the staircase. Harry swiftly unlocked the door. Colonel Race burst into the room, a look of relief washing over his features. ""You're safe, Anne. I was worried,"" he reassured her before turning his gaze to Sir Eustace. ""I've been on your trail for a while, Pedler, and now I've finally caught up with you."" Sir Eustace chuckled lightly, ""It seems everyone has lost their minds. These youngsters have been waving guns at me and hurling the most absurd accusations.""",1
"""But do we really need to consider that? I cannot fathom Madame Renauld being in cahoots with Madame Daubreuil for a variety of reasons, some of which I have already discussed with you. The rest should be quite obvious. With that possibility out of the way, we are getting closer to the real truth, which is, as always, quite fascinating and intriguing.""“Poirot,” I exclaimed, “what else have you uncovered?”“My dear friend, you must rely on your own reasoning. You have all the necessary information at your disposal! Engage your mind. Think not as Giraud does, but as Hercule Poirot does.”“But can we be certain?”“Trust me, in many instances I have acted foolishly.",1
"I was shocked to discover that she truly cared for me. I had assumed I was merely a passing fancy, yet she embraced me warmly and wept upon our reunion. After composing ourselves, I sat beside her and recounted the entire saga in detail. ""You always harbored suspicions about Colonel Race,"" she mused once my tale concluded. ""I never doubted him until the night of your disappearance. I held him in high regard and envisioned him as a suitable match for you. Please don't be offended, my dear Anne, but how can you be certain of the veracity of this young man's words? You seem to place unwavering trust in him."" ""I have complete faith in him,"" I protested adamantly.",1
"“I’m instructing you on how to face reality head-on. I’m teaching you to embrace toughness and ruthlessness, qualities that have led to my own success.” “I’d rather be dead than lose my compassion,” I declared fervently. We climbed into the car and set off. I took a moment to compose myself. Then, unexpectedly, he reached for my hand. “Anne,” he murmured softly, “I need you. Will you marry me?” I was caught off guard. “Oh, no,” I faltered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t have romantic feelings for you. I’ve never seen you in that light.” “I understand. Is that the only reason?” I knew I had to be truthful. I owed him that much. “No,” I confessed, “it is not.”",1
"""Numerous stories, both accurate and fabricated, circulated regarding the infamous gem rumored to be insured for an astonishing fifty thousand pounds. As I approached Poirot to welcome our elegant client, Miss Marvell, a flood of information about the stone rushed through my mind. She was petite, delicate, and possessed a youthful appearance, characterized by her innocent, azure eyes. Poirot kindly offered her a seat, prompting her to immediately divulge her concerns. ""You may perceive me as naive, Monsieur Poirot,"" she began, ""but after Lord Cronshaw recounted your remarkable resolution of his nephew's mysterious demise, I knew I had to seek your guidance.""",1
"There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! ""My God, Poirot!"" I cried. ""Look at her hand, her right hand. It's all red!"" Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. ""Blood,"" she cried hysterically. ""Yes, it's blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he's come back!"" Her voice died away in a gurgle. ""Lights,"" said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic.",1
"With your approval, my friend, I shall step outside for a breath of fresh air. Please anticipate my prompt return. I do not intend to be away for long."" I was in a daze in my armchair when the innkeeper knocked on the door and peeked inside. ""There is another woman here to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I informed her that he was not in, but she insists on waiting, claiming she has journeyed from the countryside."" ""Very well, bring her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can be of assistance."" In a flash, the woman was escorted into the room. My pulse quickened as I realized who she was. Lady Yardly had been featured too many times in the Society pages to go unnoticed.",1
"""After the bonds went missing from the trunk, a thorough search of the ship was conducted but yielded no results. It was discovered that the stolen bonds were sold in small parcels shortly after the ship docked in New York. This led to suspicions falling on Mr. Ridgeway. He was then searched and questioned, but the mystery remained unsolved. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Monsieur Hercule Poirot and his friend Captain Hastings decided to pay a visit to the Bank. Upon arrival, they were escorted to a small office where they met the joint general managers, Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, both of whom had dedicated their lives to the service of the Bank.""",1
"As he entered the room, a tall young man caught everyone's attention. Mrs. Renauld seemed overjoyed to see him, embracing him with tears in her eyes. The young man, Jack Renauld, explained that his voyage was delayed due to engine trouble. He received a telegram from his father instructing him to travel to South America, a journey he knew little about. Despite claims of a good relationship, Jack admitted to a heated argument with his father before his departure. The tension in the room was palpable as the interrogation continued, with Jack defiantly refusing to disclose the subject of their dispute. The atmosphere was charged with suspicion and uncertainty.",1
"When I considered it, did anyone ever bother to include the year when writing a date? If 17 was code for Cabin 17, then what about 1? Perhaps one o'clock. In that case, 22 must be the date. Glancing at my pocket almanac, I saw that tomorrow was indeed the 22nd. My excitement grew. It seemed I had finally uncovered the correct path. One thing was certain - I could not leave the cabin. The stench of asafœtida had to be endured. Reviewing my clues once more, I deduced that something was set to occur on the 22nd at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. I leaned towards 1 a.m. It was currently seven o'clock. In six hours, the truth would be revealed. The following hours were a blur.",1
"“Did he ever share any fears with you about potential threats?”“Never.”“Did he ever discuss his past in Santiago, or any potential enemies he may have had there?”“No.”“Then you have no useful information to provide?”“I’m afraid not. I fail to see why you are questioning me. Can’t his wife give you the answers you seek?” Her tone carried a subtle hint of sarcasm.“Madame Renauld has already shared all she knows.”“Ah!” exclaimed Madame Daubreuil. “I can’t help but wonder…”“What is it that you wonder, madame?”“Nothing.”The magistrate scrutinized her. He understood that he was engaged in a battle of wits with a formidable opponent.“You are maintaining that M.…”",1
"""Mr. Davenheim was known to be out sending a letter, leaving him alone in the study!"" ""Perhaps he took advantage of the situation,"" I proposed. ""But how about the tools? It's not common for city dwellers to carry burglary tools just in case! And it would be impossible to break into that safe with just a pocket knife, of course!"" ""What about Suspect Two?"" ""You mentioned that Lowen harbored resentment towards Mr. Davenheim. What you're really saying is that he had outsmarted him once or twice.

"He was a kind and fatherly man, regarding me as a naive girl facing a harsh world. Despite my efforts to prove otherwise, it seemed futile. In the end, I was left with a mere £87, 17s. 4d. to start a new life. Mr. Flemming proposed I stay with him and his wife in London, a chance I eagerly accepted. As I prepared to leave, I adjusted my appearance to fit the image of an orphan, hoping to make a good impression. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me warmly, though her husband seemed bewildered by my transformation. The day ended with plans for me to seek employment immediately. As I pondered my reflection before bed, I questioned whether my looks truly held any appeal.",1
"Poirot’s expression turned somber as he listened to the grave situation unfolding. The looming threat of the Prime Minister's kidnapping cast a shadow over the upcoming Conference, set to commence at nine o’clock the following night. The absence of the Prime Minister, the key figure with a strong personality, could lead to disastrous consequences, potentially derailing any hopes for a peaceful resolution. The Pacifist propaganda orchestrated by German agents added another layer of complexity to the already tense atmosphere. Time was running out, and there seemed to be no suitable replacement who could effectively represent England in such a crucial moment.",1
"Lady Willard was distraught after her husband's death, worried about the possibility of an ancient curse haunting her son. She sought the help of Monsieur Poirot, who surprisingly admitted to believing in superstition. Poirot assured her that he would protect her son from harm, both physical and occult. Lady Willard mentioned the members of the expedition, including her husband's nephew, who had recently committed suicide in New York. Poirot decided to investigate further and they set off for Egypt the next day, despite Poirot's dread of the sea. Now, beneath the scorching sun of the desert, Poirot's discomfort was evident as they approached the Pyramids.",1
"Moreover, what am I to occupy myself with in Pretoria? Marvel at the design of the Union buildings and catch the reverberations of gunfire in Johannesburg? I would likely be confined there for an unknown duration. Rumor has it they have sabotaged the railway line already. To make matters worse, one can't even find a decent drink there. The entire area has been placed under martial law since two days ago. ""My dear friend,"" I interjected, ""it seems you fail to grasp that I am investigating the situation on the Rand. How in the world am I expected to do so from Pretoria? I appreciate your concern for my well-being, but rest assured, I will manage just fine.""",1
"Renauld immediately followed the old woman upstairs while I lingered in the salon. Poirot eventually emerged with a serious expression on his face. ""There you are, Hastings! By thunder, there are troubles ahead!"" I was taken aback. ""What troubles do you speak of?"" I asked. Poirot, deep in thought, replied, ""I never would have imagined it, but women can be quite unpredictable."" Just then, I spotted Jack and Marthe Daubreuil approaching outside. Poirot hurriedly left the room to intercept them on the steps. ""Do not come in. It's best to stay out. Your mother is in quite a state,"" he informed them. ""I understand, I understand,"" Jack Renauld replied solemnly.",1
"""If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain.""",1
"“Renauld? Someone who was lurking near the Villa just before midnight that evening, someone who stood to gain from his demise – the shoe seems to fit Jack Renauld all too perfectly. The murder may not have been planned in advance. Ah, but then there’s the matter of the dagger!” My attention was suddenly piqued; I had overlooked this detail. “Indeed,” I mused. “The additional dagger discovered on the vagabond belonged to Mrs. Renauld. Two daggers in play, it seems.” “Indeed, and given that they were identical, it follows that Jack Renauld possessed the other. However, that aspect does not overly concern me. In fact, I have a notion or two regarding that.”",1
"It's quite possible that many individuals around the globe are unaware of the discovery of an ancient skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. One morning, I found Papa in a state of extreme excitement, almost to the point of apoplexy. He proceeded to recount the entire tale to me. ""Do you see, Anne? While there are indeed certain similarities to the Java skull, they are merely superficial. No, what we have here is what I've always argued to be the prototype of the Neanderthal lineage. Do you agree that the Gibraltar skull is the most archaic among the Neanderthal specimens discovered? It all traces back to Africa, the birthplace of the race.""",1
"No trace of her throughout the day. Anxiety crept up on me. But then, as evening descended, a newspaper delivered the shocking news. ""It was horrifying!

"“Ah, I see you're already familiar with the recent events,” remarked the detective, his expression unchanged. “I am always well-informed,” replied the inspector calmly. “But there is one detail that has likely escaped your notice,” interjected the officer, eager to display his expertise. He proceeded to recount the peculiar encounter with the unknown individual the previous evening, mentioning the peculiar check made out to ""Duveen"" and concluding with the letter signed ""Bella."" The detective listened attentively, examined the letter meticulously, and returned it without a word. “Fascinating, Monsieur. However, my original hypothesis remains unaltered.""",1
"""After identifying the sole doctor in Marsdon Leigh as Dr. Ralph Bernard, we arrived at his residence. Situated slightly off the main road, the house appeared to be a refined cottage. The doctor's name was displayed on a brass plate attached to the gate. As we walked up the path and rang the bell, luck was on our side. We caught Dr. Bernard during his consulting hour, with no patients in queue at that moment. Dr. Bernard, an elderly man with a slight stoop and genial demeanor, welcomed us. Poirot, introducing himself, outlined the purpose of our visit, emphasizing the necessity for Insurance Companies to conduct a thorough investigation in such cases.""",1
"""And now, my dear, you see the consequences of youth and beauty. I have revealed confidential information for you!"" The woman chuckled, then graciously expressed her gratitude. ""I should return home now. My mother will be worried."" With that, she hurried back along the road, resembling a modern-day Atalanta. I gazed in her direction. ""My friend,"" Poirot remarked, his voice tinged with irony, ""are we to remain rooted here all night simply because you have encountered a lovely young lady who has captivated you?"" I chuckled and offered my apologies. ""But she is truly stunning, Poirot. It's hard not to be taken aback by her beauty."" Poirot let out a groan.",1

Have a seat, and I will detail the entire case that has concluded so satisfactorily."" ""Concluded?"" ""Indeed. They have been apprehended."" ""Who has been apprehended?"" ""The chambermaid and the valet, of course! Did you not suspect? Especially after my mention of French chalk?"" ""You mentioned it was used by cabinet-makers."" ""Indeed, to help drawers slide smoothly. Someone wanted that drawer to move in silence. Who else but the chambermaid? The plan was so clever that it eluded even Hercule Poirot at first glance.""",1
"""Given the timing of the crime, suspicion will not fall on him. His irritation when Bella unexpectedly arrives is clear. He quickly gets rid of her to focus on his plans. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, ensuring she sticks to their story. He carefully covers his tracks, leaving clues that point back to him. He meets a grim fate on the golf links. The murder of M. Renauld has been solved, but a deeper mystery remains. Poirot's brilliance shines as he unravels the truth behind the crime. Madame Renauld's strength and sacrifice are commendable. The lead piping was meant to conceal the victim's identity. Now, the focus shifts to finding the real killer.""",1
"""He's deceiving me,"" I mused. ""But for what reason?"" ""Has your employer leased the residence? Have there been any unfamiliar faces inside over the past three years?"" ""Negative, sir."" ""Any guests?"" ""Just Miss Violet."" ""No unfamiliar individuals have set foot in this chamber?"" ""None, sir."" ""You're overlooking the laborers, Jim,"" his spouse pointed out. ""Laborers?"" Poirot snapped at her. ""What laborers?"" The lady disclosed that approximately two and a half years ago, workers had been present to perform specific repairs. She was rather unclear on the nature of the repairs. Her belief was that it was a mere whim of her employer's and completely unnecessary.",1
"""What was the significance of the men's attire? Are you proposing that Conneau switched clothes with his victim after the stabbing, including the dagger?"" ""I fail to see the relevance,"" I retorted indignantly. ""He might have coerced Madame Daubreuil into giving him clothes and money earlier in the day."" ""Through coercion? Is that your theory?"" ""Indeed. He could have threatened to expose her identity to the Renaulds, jeopardizing her daughter's marriage."" ""You are mistaken, Hastings. He couldn't have blackmailed her, as she held the upper hand. Remember, Georges Conneau is still a murder suspect. A single word from her could lead him to the guillotine.""",1
"I will search every corner of the city until I find him, and once I do, I will make him mine. I would do anything for him. I would toil for him, serve him, commit crimes for him, and even plead or steal for him if necessary! Now you understand!"" Sarah stared at me intently. ""You are not like the typical English woman, Gipsy girl,"" she remarked eventually. ""You possess a unique combination of practicality and intense emotion. I doubt I will ever feel that way about anyone, thankfully for me, but at the same time, I cannot help but envy you, Gipsy girl. It is a rare gift to truly care for someone. Most individuals are incapable of such depth of feeling.""",1
"In all of France, there exists only one individual who can identify him. This fact represents a lucrative opportunity for Madame Daubreuil, one that she exploits without hesitation. She holds complete power over him and extracts a significant amount of money from him. Eventually, the expected outcome occurs. Jack Renauld develops feelings for the lovely young lady he encounters regularly and desires to wed her. This decision sparks a reaction from his father, who is determined to stop his son from marrying the offspring of this wicked woman. While Jack Renauld remains unaware of his father's history, Madame Renauld possesses full knowledge of the past.",1
"The burly man's firm hold renders me as defenseless as a mere infant. The situation is undeniably awkward and bordering on the absurd. Let us compose ourselves and remain composed."" ""You won't give chase?"" ""No, certainly not. Am I Giraud? Let go of me, my good man."" Keeping a wary gaze fixed on him, as I was well aware that I was no match for Poirot in terms of cunning, I loosened my grasp, and he eased into an armchair, rubbing his arms gently. ""You possess the strength of a bull when provoked, Hastings! Well, do you believe you have treated your old friend fairly? I present you with the girl's photograph and you recognize her, yet you remain silent.""",1
"The French authorities, our own police force, and the army are all working tirelessly to solve this mystery. Despite their efforts, nothing has been uncovered yet."" As they spoke, there was a knock on the door. A young soldier entered, carrying a sealed envelope which he passed to Lord Estair. ""Fresh from France, sir. I rushed it over as per your instructions."" Lord Estair eagerly tore open the envelope and let out a gasp. The soldier exited the room. ""Finally, a breakthrough! This telegram has just been deciphered. They have located the second vehicle, along with the secretary, Daniels, who was drugged, silenced, and restrained at an old farm near C.""",1
"""Over there, on the other side of the water, is where we need to be. We'll have to make a run for it. Can you swim, Anne? It doesn't matter, I'll make sure you get across. It's too rocky for a boat on this side, but perfect for swimming, and perfect for reaching Livingstone."" ""I can manage a bit more than just a short swim. What's the danger, Harry?"" I asked, noticing the seriousness in his expression. ""Sharks?"" ""No, dear Anne. Sharks are creatures of the sea. But you're clever to think of that. It's crocs we need to worry about."" ""Crocodiles?"" ""Exactly. Try not to think about them or pray, whichever you prefer."" And with that, we dove into the water.",1
"“Furthermore, how do you explain the excavation of the burial site? That required considerable effort.” “Perhaps she had assistance,” I proposed, reluctant to abandon my theory. “I move on to another issue. You mentioned the resemblance between the two incidents. What exactly is it, my dear companion?” I gazed at him in surprise. “Poirot, it was actually you who pointed that out! The account of the masked intruders, the ‘mystery,’ the documents!” Poirot smirked slightly. “Please, do not be so outraged. I stand by my observations. The likeness of the narratives inevitably ties the two scenarios together. However, consider now something quite peculiar.",1
"""I vehemently deny your accusations,"" I retorted. He flashed a reassuring smile, ""I trust you completely, Miss Redmond. I have never doubted your loyalty. However, there is someone on this ship who has been aware of my secrets from the start. All it takes is one word from him and I am done for. Nonetheless, I am willing to gamble on the chance that he remains silent."" ""And why is that?"" I inquired. ""Because he is a man who prefers to work alone. Once the authorities apprehend me, I will no longer be of any value to him. Perhaps, I might even gain my freedom. Only time will tell."" His laughter was tinged with mockery, yet his expression turned steely.",1
"""Ah, that must be Japp and his crew pulling up."" A loud thud echoed on the door. ""How could you have found this location?"" I inquired as I trailed Poirot into the hallway. ""Ah, yes, you tailed the first Mrs. Robinson after she departed the other apartment."" ""Well done, Hastings. Your brain cells are finally in action. Now, time for a surprise for Japp."" Quietly unlocking the door, he peeked the cat's head around the corner and let out a sharp ""Meow."" The inspector from Scotland Yard, accompanied by another man, flinched involuntarily. ""Ah, it's just Monsieur Poirot up to his usual tricks!"" he exclaimed, while Poirot's head emerged next to the cat's.",1
"""At what time should we commence?"" ""The stroke of midnight holds an air of solemnity and seems fitting, I believe. It is unlikely that anything will transpire before then."" Promptly at twelve o’clock, we stealthily entered the coal-lift and descended to the second level. With Poirot's deft touch, the wooden door swung open swiftly, granting us access to the apartment. Moving from the scullery to the kitchen, we settled comfortably in two chairs, leaving the door to the hall slightly ajar. ""Now, all that remains is to wait,"" Poirot remarked contently, closing his eyes. The wait felt interminable to me, as I dreaded the thought of succumbing to sleep.",1
"“Feel free to inquire about anything, Monsieur Poirot,” Willard stated. “We are completely bewildered by this odd string of events, but we truly believe it is simply a series of coincidences.” Despite his words, there was a noticeable nervousness in his demeanor. Poirot carefully observed him. “Are you truly dedicated to this task, Sir Guy?” “Absolutely. Regardless of what may occur, the work will continue. Rest assured of that.” Poirot turned to the doctor. “And what is your stance on the matter, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” the doctor drawled, “I have no intention of giving up.” Poirot responded with one of his characteristic expressive grimaces.",1
"""Really?"" ""Did you not hear the news?"" ""What news?"" ""There was another murder last night!"" ""What?"" Abandoning my breakfast, I grabbed my hat and sprinted towards the scene. Another murder and Poirot was not around! What bad luck. But who was the victim? I burst through the gate. A cluster of servants stood in the driveway, chatting and gesturing. I grabbed Françoise. ""What's going on?"" ""Oh, sir! Another death! It's awful. There's a curse on this place. Yes, I'm saying it, a curse! They need to call for the priest to bring some holy water. I'll never spend another night under this roof. It could be me next, who knows?"" She made the sign of the cross.",1
"""The nature of crimes remains constant,"" Poirot observed calmly. Giraud's demeanor indicated his readiness to oppose. He did not want to share any connection with the other man, and it seemed likely that he would withhold any crucial information he discovered. ""The investigating official,"" Bex started to say. But Giraud cut him off bluntly: ""Who cares about the investigating official! The crucial factor is the light. It will disappear within the next thirty minutes. I am well-informed about the situation, and the residents of the residence will manage fine until the next day, but if we hope to uncover the perpetrators, this is where we must search.""",1
"""“Why did you do it?” The nobleman demanded, his voice filled with confusion. Poirot remained calm as he responded, “I simply wanted to force a resolution.” Lord Yardly was taken aback, exclaiming, “To force a resolution! Dear God!” Poirot continued cheerfully, “And the plan worked, my lord. Therefore, I am pleased to return this to you.” With a grand gesture, he revealed a dazzling diamond. “The prized Star of the East,” Lord Yardly whispered in awe. “But I am at a loss for words.” “No matter,” Poirot replied. “Rest assured, the diamond is safe with you. It was necessary for it to be taken. I promised its protection, and I have upheld my promise.""",1
"""Anne had an agreement with me. She entered the snare willingly, hoping to catch him. We had a system of secret signals. Anne knew his telegram was fake.

The house was shelled. I must get you out, Anne. The game is up. Race's men followed me here. The murder of Nadina. I was in Marlow that day. You knew her, had a motive. I have the diamonds. Your only hope gone. We'll talk. I'll make a deal. You've got me cornered. I'll leave a signed confession if you let me escape.""",1
"""Hautet pondered the scene before him. 'Another crime!' he exclaimed. 'The depths of this case have yet to be plumbed. A veil of mystery shrouds it all. But who is the unfortunate victim this time?' 'That, M. le juge, is the question on everyone's mind. The victim remains unidentified,' Giraud replied. 'Where is the body?' inquired the doctor. Giraud stepped aside, revealing the body in the corner. 'Stabbed through the heart, as you can see, with the very dagger stolen yesterday morning. It appears the murder swiftly followed the theft, but I leave that determination to you. Feel free to examine the dagger - there are no fingerprints to be found.'""",1
"""He discovered some spare change in his pants pocket."" ""But no wallet."" ""Some individuals do not carry a wallet or purse of any sort."" I attempted a different approach. ""You do not find it strange that the physician never appeared afterwards?"" ""A busy doctor often does not keep up with the news. He likely forgot all about the incident."" ""In truth, detective, you seem intent on finding nothing unusual,"" I remarked politely. ""Well, I believe you use the term a bit too frequently, Miss Beddingfeld. Young women tend to be idealistic, I understand, fascinated by enigmas and similar matters. However, as I am pressed for time"" I took the cue and stood up.",1
"""I inquired about the circumstances. Both of us were daring and eager for danger. One evening, we exchanged identity tokens for good fortune! Lucas met his end the following day, torn apart in an explosion."" I recoiled in horror. ""But why keep it from me until now? Why not this morning? Surely, you must have known by now that I care for you deeply?"" ""Anne, I didn't want to ruin everything. I wanted to take you away to the island. What use is money? It cannot buy happiness. We could have found joy on the island. I'm telling you, I fear that other life, it almost destroyed me once."" ""Did Sir Eustace recognize your true identity?"" ""Of course, he did.""",1
"""Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station."" ""Oh, no, thank you,"" I said hastily. ""Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered."" To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. ""I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!"" ""What has he done now?"" I inquired with some curiosity. ""He’s got hold of a secretary for me.",1
"I had no trouble executing my plans. Found a small hotel in a back street, got a room, paid deposit without luggage, and went to bed. Next morning, up early to buy clothes. Waited for the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia to leave with most of the party. Took a tram out of town for a walk. My shoe-lace came untied, a man almost walked into me. Recognized him as the man from the night before. He followed me. Got off tram, he did too. Hailed next tram, he followed. Realized I was up against a gang, led by the ""Colonel"".

"We said our goodbyes. His departing words were, ‘You pride yourself on your intelligence, my dear,’ he stated. ‘I may not have a formal education, but nevertheless, I am willing to match wits with you anytime. Time will reveal who the victor will be.’ “That was nearly a decade ago. I would occasionally visit him for a weekend, and although we got along well, his beliefs never wavered. He never brought up my academic achievements, whether it be my matriculation or my B.Sc. Over the last three years, his health had been deteriorating, and a month ago he passed away. “I have now arrived at the reason for my presence. My uncle’s will is quite peculiar.",1
"""But the insides of this feline are exquisitely fragile. I am referring to its interior.” With a sudden grunt, the second man snatched the cat from Poirot’s grasp. “Oh, I neglected to make proper introductions,” Japp remarked. “Mr. Poirot, meet Mr. Burt from the United States Secret Service.” The American’s skilled hands had sensed what he was after. He extended his hand, momentarily at a loss for words. Then he composed himself. “A pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Mr. Burt greeted. “Perhaps,” Poirot murmured, “there is a chance I won’t perish on this occasion.” As a recovering flu patient, I took this statement as a sign of hope and optimism.",1
"""I apologize for the inconvenience, madam. To make this process easier for you, I will ask questions and you may simply respond. When did you retire for the night yesterday?” “Around 9:30 pm, sir. I was quite fatigued.” “And your spouse?” “I believe he followed suit an hour later.” “Was he agitated or unsettled in any way?” “No, not noticeably.” “What transpired next?” “I was awoken by a hand covering my mouth. Despite my efforts to scream, it was futile. Two masked intruders were present.” “Can you provide a description of the suspects, madam?” “One was tall with a lengthy black beard, while the other was shorter and stout, with a reddish beard.”",1
"I am certain of Mrs. Renauld's innocence in this case, as her fainting was genuine and her anguish real. She did not need to fake her grief, as she had already shown true emotion upon hearing of her husband's death. The open door at the crime scene puzzled Poirot, who believed that the culprit must have left through the window. This theory was supported by the lack of footprints in one of the flower beds, which had been smoothed over with a rake to erase any trace of the intruder's presence. Despite initial doubts, I began to consider the possibility that the murderer had indeed escaped through the window, opening up a new avenue of investigation.",1
"Lord Estair was visibly shaken as he entered Poirot's office. ""I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy,"" he said. Poirot assured him, ""You have the word of Hercule Poirot I can say no more!"" Lord Estair then revealed the shocking news - the Prime Minister had been kidnapped just before the crucial Allied Conference. As Poirot delved deeper into the details, it became clear that time was of the essence. The race was on to rescue the Prime Minister before the conference began the following evening. The situation was dire, the stakes were high, and Poirot knew that failure was not an option.",1
"“Did you find anything in Renauld’s belongings?” inquired Poirot. “We conducted a thorough search of his study, sifting through his personal papers. Unfortunately, we came up empty-handed. Everything appeared to be in order and nothing caught our attention, except for his will. Take a look.” Poirot quickly perused the document. “I see. A generous bequest of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor – do you know who he is?” “He was Mr. Renauld’s secretary. Although he primarily resided in England, he did visit here occasionally for short periods.” “And the rest of his estate was bequeathed to his dear wife, Eloise. The will is simple, yet legally binding.”",1
"""I never suspected you to be a fool, my dear lady, but might I suggest that you are rather reckless? The 'Colonel' is not one to tolerate blackmail, you know."" ""I have no fear of him,"" she chuckled. ""There is only one man who has ever truly frightened me, and he's long gone."" The man regarded her with a curious expression. ""Let's hope he doesn't return from the dead,"" he quipped. ""What do you mean?"" the dancer demanded. The Count appeared taken aback. ""I simply meant that a resurrection would be inconvenient for you,"" he clarified. ""Just a silly jest."" She breathed a sigh of relief. ""Oh, no need to worry. He's definitely dead. Killed in the war.""",1
"“No. 13 on Deck D?” I exclaimed in horror. “Absolutely not, I refuse to stay in that cabin.” Superstition had always been my weakness, and the thought of being in cabin 13 sent shivers down my spine. Reluctantly, I pleaded with the steward, “Please, tell me there is another available cabin.” After a moment of contemplation, the steward suggested, “What about cabin 17? It’s just down the starboard side. It was unoccupied this morning, but I suspect it may have been assigned by now. However, since the gentleman hasn’t moved in yet, he might not mind switching.” Eagerly, I accepted the offer and the steward went off to seek approval from the purser.",1
"Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face. In a few clear words Poirot set forth the purpose of his visit. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic. “We don’t want to see Miss Violet deprived of what belongs to her,” declared the woman. “It would be terribly unfair for hospitals to receive everything.” Poirot proceeded with his inquiries. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered distinctly witnessing the will. Baker had been tasked with obtaining two pre-printed will-forms from the nearby town. “Two?” questioned Poirot sharply. “Yes, sir, for precaution, I suppose, in case one is ruined and indeed, that's exactly what happened.”",1
"I despise being entangled in such matters. The day took a turn when Guy Pagett entered my bedroom this morning, holding a telegram with a solemn expression that rivaled a mourner at a funeral. Guy Pagett, my diligent secretary, is an exemplary individual in every aspect - diligent, meticulous, and hard-working. Yet, he manages to irritate me like no other. I have pondered for quite some time on how to remove him from my service. However, it is not feasible to terminate a secretary simply because he prioritizes work over leisure, enjoys rising early, and possesses no discernible vices. The one redeeming quality about him is his somber countenance.",1
"Poirot's conversation with the doctor turned to the ancient beliefs of Egypt, causing tension among the group. Despite the doctor's skepticism, Poirot's interest in the supernatural was evident. As they explored the excavations, a sense of unease lingered in the air. Hassan, a servant, warned Poirot of evil spirits present and urged the young master to leave. The sighting of a shadowy figure resembling Anubis, the god of departing souls, heightened the group's fear. Dr. Ames and Sir Guy attempted to catch the mysterious figure but found no trace of its existence. Poirot, unfazed by the events, focused on ensuring his safety in his own unique way.",1
"""However, she found solace in his lack of dismissal towards her fears. Surprisingly, I had never imagined Poirot to possess such a strong belief in superstitions. Bringing up the topic on our way back, his demeanor was serious. 'Indeed, Hastings. I have faith in these matters. Superstition holds significant power.' 'So, what's our next move?' 'Always practical, dear Hastings! Well, first things first, we will send a cable to New York for more information on the death of young Mr. Bleibner.' With that, he promptly dispatched the cable. The response was detailed and to the point, revealing that young Rupert Bleibner had been struggling for years.""",1
"""They couldn't have been concealed on board and we know they weren't because they were put up for sale shortly after the Olympia docked, well before I initiated the search and sent out the descriptions.

""Just the authorized ones, and that was after the alarm was raised when everyone was vigilant. I was personally on the lookout for any exchange happening that way. Dear heavens, Monsieur Poirot, this situation is maddening! People are starting to accuse me of taking them myself.""",1
"Lady Willard was terrified for her son, who seemed determined to continue his father's work in Egypt despite the dangers. Poirot promised to protect him, but the deaths surrounding the expedition raised suspicions. Rupert Bleibner's suicide and mysterious letter hinted at a more modern crime, possibly involving poison. As Poirot and Hastings arrived in Egypt, they learned of another death from tetanus. Dr. Ames and Mr. Harper shared insights about the deceased, while Poirot's theories about ancient Egyptian spirits caused skepticism among the others. Poirot's unorthodox methods and belief in superstition led the investigation in a new direction.",1
"” She reluctantly agreed, promising to revisit the topic once we reached the Falls. The train departed at nine in the morning. Sir Eustace remained in a foul mood, while Miss Pettigrew appeared meek. Colonel Race exuded his usual air of confidence. I couldn't shake the feeling that our previous discussion was a figment of my imagination. That night, I slept fitfully on my uncomfortable cot, tormented by vague, threatening nightmares. The next morning, I awoke with a pounding headache and stepped out onto the observation deck. The air was crisp and fragrant, and as far as the eye could see, rolling wooded hills stretched out in every direction.”",1

Suspects include Jack Renauld, the gardener, and Madame Daubreuil. Mysterious visitor, a cheque to ""Duveen,"" and a letter signed ""Bella."" Poirot questions the open door. A crime resembling this one before. The psychology of crime and individual touch. Japp would agree, Hastings.""",1
"“I recognize the name, but it doesn’t ring a bell right now. What does she do?” “I’m not sure, but take a look at her picture.” After a brief moment of inspection, Mr. Aarons exclaimed, “I remember now!” He enthusiastically patted his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, of course!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “Yes, they are a duo of sisters. They perform as acrobats, dancers, and singers. Quite talented. They’re currently touring in the provinces, or possibly taking a break. I think they just finished a run in Paris.” “Could you please find out their exact location for me?” “No problem. Just head home, and I’ll have the information for you in the morning.”",1
"""I watched as she prepared for a long night ahead. Taking a seat, I expressed my confusion at her distress. ""My dream - that dinner we had,"" she exclaimed. I raised an eyebrow at her reaction to the curry. ""Oh, Sir Eustace!"" she cried, clearly upset. But we both knew that nightmares often follow a heavy meal. Trying to calm her, I suggested that Anne Beddingfeld and Race were simply taking a late-night walk without causing a commotion. ""Do you really believe they're just out for a stroll at this hour?"" she questioned. ""People do foolish things when they're young,"" I replied, defending their actions. ""Although Race should certainly know better.""",1

A thrilling discovery at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia had Papa in a frenzy, claiming it to be the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race.

Suzanne grinned at me knowingly, ""You're not one for inactivity, are you, Anne?"" I chuckled, ""Not my preferred state, no."" Determined to take action, I decided to retrieve a train schedule to determine when Guy Pagett's train would be passing through Kimberley. It was scheduled to arrive at 5.",1
"""His presence is both repulsive and intriguing; an aura of fear always surrounds him,"" she whispered. ""He was overseas during the Kimberley heist,"" Harry revealed thoughtfully. ""It was him who divulged the 'Colonel's' secrets to Suzanne, detailing his escapades in Paris."" ""A masterful deception,"" she mused. ""But where does Pagett fit into this puzzle? Is he a pawn of Race?"" ""Possibly,"" Harry pondered, ""or perhaps Pagett is playing a game of his own."" ""What?"" ""Recall, Anne. Have you ever heard Pagett's version of the events at Kilmorden?"" ""Only through Sir Eustace,"" she replied, recounting the tale. Harry absorbed every word with keen interest.",1

""It's a fact! Have you talked to Mrs. Renauld about your romantic investigation?"" ""No, sir. We didn't want to cause her unnecessary distress."" ""Distress? She would scoff at you. Let me tell you, she and Renauld were an exceptional pair."" ""Ah, that reminds me of something else,"" M. Hautet interjected.",1
"What an incredible chance for a skilled thief! Look over there, Hastings, that large woman standing next to the pillar. She is absolutely covered in jewels."" I followed his gaze. ""Oh my, that's Mrs. Opalsen."" ""You know her?"" ""A little. Her husband is a wealthy stockbroker who struck it rich in the recent Oil boom."" Later that evening we bumped into the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We exchanged pleasantries for a short while, and eventually enjoyed coffee together. Poirot complimented some of the more expensive gems adorning the lady's chest, and she immediately perked up. ""Collecting gems is a passion of mine, Mr.…""",1
"""But the real question is whether he actually revealed his secret to her. The examining magistrate is optimistic, but I have my doubts.” As we strolled along the path leading to the intersection where our car had broken down earlier, it suddenly struck me that the Villa Marguerite, the residence of the enigmatic Madame Daubreuil, was the same quaint cottage where the lovely young woman had appeared. “She has resided here for quite some time,” remarked the commissary, gesturing towards the dwelling. “Very discreetly, without drawing any attention. It appears she has no family or close companions aside from the people she knows in Merlinville.""",1
"""Furthermore, in this instance.” Leaning in, he extracted an object from the dagger's handle and displayed it before me. It was a strand of long, black hair, reminiscent of the one Poirot had retrieved from the armchair in the library. With a faintly mocking grin, he wrapped it around the dagger once more. ""Let us maintain the status quo as much as possible,"" he remarked. ""It satisfies the examining magistrate. Well, do you perceive anything else?"" I was compelled to shake my head. ""Examine his hands."" I complied. The nails were ragged and stained, the skin calloused. It provided little insight, much to my disappointment. I glanced at Giraud.",1
"""I've already mentioned it to Mary. But she's a typical woman, always wanting to be the center of attention when it comes to jewelry."" ""That's absurd, Gregory!""

He escorted them to the door and then returned. ""Ah! Women's stories! The good husband, though lacking tact, hit the nail on the head. Definitely."" I shared my vague recollections with him, and he nodded in agreement. ""Just as I suspected. However, there is something peculiar lurking beneath the surface of all this.""",1
"""Oh, what a beauty she is, cellela!” The elderly woman exclaimed with a hint of disdain. “Madame Daubreuil,” whispered the police commissioner in disbelief. “Inconceivable.” “Well, there you have it,” grumbled Françoise. “That's what happens when you speak the truth.” “Not necessarily,” the judge interjected calmly. “It was unexpected, that's all. So, Madame Daubreuil and Monsieur Renauld, they were...” he paused tactfully. “Ah? Was it truly them?” “Who's to say? But what can you do? Monsieur was a very wealthy English lord and Madame Daubreuil, despite her humble lifestyle, was quite elegant,” expressed the examining magistrate thoughtfully.",1
"As I strained to hear young Renauld's response, my attention was suddenly captured by an unexpected sight a short distance away from the hedge. There was what appeared to be a brown bush, a peculiar sight indeed for this time of year. Intrigued, I approached for a closer look, only to have the brown bush swiftly retreat and signal for me to remain silent. It was Giraud. Gesturing for caution, he guided me around the shed until we were safely out of earshot. ""What were you up to over there?"" I inquired. ""The same thing you were doing - eavesdropping,"" Giraud replied. ""But I stumbled upon it accidentally!"" ""Ah,"" was all Giraud said in response.",1
"As the sun began to set, Harry's mood shifted suddenly. ""You must leave here tomorrow,"" he exclaimed, his voice filled with urgency. ""I can't bear any more. You must go, Anne. You're not a fool. You know yourself that this can't go on."" Surprised by his outburst, I replied calmly, ""I suppose not. But it's been happy, hasn't it?"" Harry's face grew grim as he spoke of his past, revealing his true identity as Harry Lucas. His story was one of betrayal, theft, and loss, leaving us both haunted by the ghosts of our pasts. The shadows of our intertwined destinies darkened the doorway of the hut as we faced the harsh realities of our shared history.",1
"Poirot and I arrived at the Villa Geneviève to find a chaos of questions surrounding the murder of Mr. Renauld. The body was found in an open grave, a shocking discovery that raised more questions than answers. The servants, including the old housekeeper Françoise, were questioned about the events of the night, but it seemed that there was more to the story than met the eye. The mysterious lady who visited Mr. Renauld on the night of the murder added another layer of intrigue to the case. As we delved deeper into the investigation, it became clear that there were secrets hidden within the walls of the Villa Geneviève, waiting to be uncovered.",1
"""But I couldn't help but raise one final concern: “What about the match and cigarette end discovered near the victim's body? How do you explain that?” Poirot's face instantly brightened with amusement. “Planted! Clearly planted there as a deliberate ploy for Giraud or one of his associates to stumble upon! Giraud may be cunning, but he's no match for my intellect. He struts in, proud of his discovery. After hours of crawling on his belly, he presents his findings. ‘Look what I have uncovered,’ he boasts. And then he turns to me, eagerly awaiting my response: ‘What do you make of this scene?’ And I, with unwavering honesty, reply, ‘Nothing.’""",1
"""Exploring this unfamiliar world had a certain allure, especially when I witnessed her animated expression light up while she spoke. Our journey took us through Amiens, triggering a flood of memories. It seemed as though my companion could read my thoughts. “Reflecting on the War?” I nodded in response. “You served, I presume?” “Yes, I did. I got injured once, and after the Somme, I was discharged. I had a temporary role in the Army for a while. Now, I work as a private secretary for an M.P.” “Impressive!” “Not really. It’s quite mundane, to be honest. I usually wrap up my work in a couple of hours each day. It’s not very stimulating either.",1
"""I completely agree. So, we should seek out the origins of the note,"" said the commissary. ""I will immediately send a message to the authorities in Santiago, asking for all information regarding the victim's life there - his romantic relationships, business dealings, friendships, and any enemies he might have had. It would be surprising if we don't uncover a lead to his perplexing murder after that."" The commissary looked around for confirmation. ""Wonderful,"" Poirot remarked approvingly. ""His spouse might also provide us with some insight,"" the magistrate suggested. ""Have you discovered any additional correspondence from this Bella among M.""",1
"“Interesting,” he whispered. “We all possess the little grey cells. Yet, so few of us know how to utilize them. Good day, Signor Ascanio. Your account aligns closely with my assumptions. However, verification was necessary.” After showing his visitor to the door, Poirot settled back into his armchair and grinned in my direction. “Shall we listen to M. le Capitaine Hastings's take on the matter?” “I suppose Ascanio is correct, someone did impersonate him.” “You persist in neglecting to use the intelligence bestowed upon you. Reflect on certain remarks I made upon exiting the apartment that evening. I made note of the undrawn window curtains.”",1
"""Without fail, Poirot's intuition proved correct. Soon after, the famous American movie star entered the room, prompting us to stand up in respect. Mary Marvell was undeniably one of the most beloved actresses in Hollywood. She had recently arrived in England with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, who was also a well-known actor. Their wedding had occurred just a year earlier in the United States, marking their inaugural trip to England. The couple had been warmly welcomed by the public. Mary Marvell's stunning attire, luxurious furs, and exquisite jewelry, particularly a diamond known as ""the Western Star,"" had captivated everyone's attention.""",1
"She was a stranger to the London crowd. The images of the Marlow victim in the newspapers were so distorted that it's no surprise no one could recognize them. On the flip side, Nadina had concealed her plans to visit England from everyone. The day following the homicide, her manager received a letter supposedly from the dancer, stating she was rushing back to Russia due to urgent personal matters and he should handle her terminated contract as he saw fit. I only found out about all of this later. With Suzanne's complete agreement, I dispatched a lengthy telegram from De Aar. It arrived at a crucial moment (this, too, I discovered afterward).",1
"The young woman is quite astute. Single-handedly, it seems, she has uncovered the true identity of the deceased woman found in my residence. The victim was a Russian performer named Nadina. When I inquired with Anne Beddingfeld about the accuracy of this information, she claimed it was a deduction in the style of Sherlock Holmes. Nevertheless, it appears she has already sent this information to Nasby as an established fact. Women possess these instincts, and I am confident that Anne Beddingfeld's assumption is correct, although labeling it a deduction is preposterous. How she secured a position at the Daily Budget is beyond my comprehension.",1
"""I remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent. I assisted him with a Japanese wrestler. He can help us find what we need to know. It took time to find him. He agreed to help. Aarons knows a young girl named Bella Duveen. She is a performer. The Dulcibella Kids are her sisters. They are in Coventry at the Palace. Poirot booked tickets for the show. The sisters performed well. Bella Duveen, now Cinderella, confessed to taking the dagger. She feared being caught. I comforted her and confessed my love. She was surprised and asked why I wouldn't turn her in. I reassured her of my love and understanding. She was relieved and asked what I knew.""",1
"After conversing with Colonel Race, Suzanne announced her fatigue and retired to bed. Unwilling to stay alone with him, I also stood and made my way to my own room. Despite my restlessness, I found myself unable to sleep. Instead of changing into nightclothes, I reclined in a chair, lost in reverie. An ominous sense of impending danger loomed nearer with each passing moment. Suddenly, a sharp rap at the door startled me from my thoughts. Approaching cautiously, I opened the door to find a young boy holding out a mysterious note addressed to me in an unfamiliar handwriting. Accepting the note, I returned to the room, puzzled by its contents.",1
"""My acquaintance, who appeared to be anxiously monitoring the weather, directed a disapproving look at me. “Have you forgotten the superior method of Laverguier? I always adhere to his system. One must center themselves, as you may recall, by turning the head from side to side, inhaling and exhaling, pausing for six counts between each breath.” “Hm,” I hesitated. “You'll surely grow weary of centering yourself and counting to six by the time you reach Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever your journey concludes.” “Quelle idée! Do you truly believe that I intend to travel to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld seems to imply it in his correspondence.""",1
"""We abandoned her at Villa Marguerite, headed straight to Villa Geneviève, and yet she beat us there!"" ""No, we didn't actually leave her behind. She slipped out the back of Villa Marguerite while we were conversing with her mother in the entrance. That's how she managed to outsmart Hercule Poirot!"" ""But the shadow on the blind? We spotted it from the street."" ""Well, by the time we glanced up, Madame Daubreuil had swiftly ascended the stairs and positioned herself."" ""Madame Daubreuil?"" ""Indeed. One is elderly, the other youthful, one brunette, and the other blonde, but their silhouettes on the blind are remarkably similar for this purpose.""",1
"Arriving at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.” “Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s only that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself all right.” Poirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked himself.",1
"I had leaped to my feet and was standing eye to eye with the stranger in the center of the room. There weren't many places to hide in that room for a man of his stature. I swiftly dragged out my heavy trunk, forcing him to crouch behind it and slip beneath the bed. I opened the lid of the trunk, all the while reaching for the wash-basin with my other hand. In one fluid motion, I twisted my hair into a tight bun on top of my head. It might not have been a sophisticated look, but it served its purpose. A woman, with her hair haphazardly tied up and reaching for a bar of soap to wash her neck, would never raise suspicion of aiding a fugitive.",1
"The detective adjusted his tie, fixing his gaze on my companion in a playful manner. “You don’t see eye to eye with me, do you? So, what aspect of the case stands out to you? I’m all ears.” “There is something that strikes me as significant. Tell me, Mr. Smith, does anything about this case ring a bell? Does it not remind you of something?” “Ring a bell? Remind me of something? I can’t think of anything at the moment. I don’t believe so, though.” “You are mistaken,” remarked Holmes calmly. “A crime very much like this one has occurred in the past.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, regrettably, escapes me at present but I will soon recall it.”",1
"""Anne, do you recognize that man over there?"" I inquired casually. ""Oh, is he your new secretary?"" she responded, a hint of curiosity in her voice.""Yes, that's Mr. Rayburn. Unfortunately, he hasn't been feeling well lately,"" I revealed.""Interesting. How long has he been working for you?"" Anne probed further, her eyes fixed on me.""Not too long, actually. I hired him right before my trip,"" I disclosed, trying to be vague.Anne didn't miss a beat. ""And who recommended him to you?"" she asked, her tone direct.I hesitated slightly before answering, ""An old friend put in a good word for him.""After that, Anne fell silent, lost in her own thoughts.",1
"""Despite their efforts to escape, Nemesis caught up with them in the end. When news broke of the tragic Air Mail crash to Paris claiming the lives of the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering, I felt a sense of justice prevailing. 'There seems to be a surge in bond robberies recently,' I remarked one morning, setting aside the newspaper. 'Poirot, let's leave the art of detection behind and venture into the world of crime instead!' 'Are you trying to get rich quick, my friend?' 'Just consider the latest heist, the million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds en route from London and Scottish Bank to New York, vanishing mysteriously aboard the Olympia.'""",1
"""I don't understand why she would lie. She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men, and she lied about something else. So, Hastings, what's your take on the open door?"" ""Well,"" I responded, feeling a bit uneasy, ""I think it was just a mistake. Someone must have forgotten to close it."" Poirot shook his head, looking disappointed. ""That's what Giraud thinks. But I'm not convinced. There's a deeper meaning to that open door that eludes me for now."" ""Wait, I might have a theory,"" I exclaimed suddenly. ""Well, let's hear it then."" ""Consider this. We both know that Mrs. Renauld's version of events is false. Could it be that Mr.",1
"I collected all the necessary information from Mrs. Havering and we quickly discovered that the mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton, had connections to the crime. She seemed to have disappeared after the murder. It was evident that she had played a crucial role in providing an alibi for Mrs. Havering during the time of the crime. The murderer had arrived and escaped in a car, which also brought Mrs. Middleton to her new position. The revolver found at Ealing was a diversion tactic, and the true culprits managed to evade justice. It was a complex and well-executed plan, leaving us no choice but to accept the hand of Fate in this matter.",1
"I had never encountered someone so ignorant, mistaking the superstitions of the Middle Ages for the beliefs of Ancient Egypt. It was a jumble of misinformation and gullibility. After calming down the eager specialist, I accompanied Poirot into the tent. My dear friend was grinning from ear to ear. ""We can finally rest easy now,"" he announced with joy. ""I could really use some rest. My head is pounding relentlessly. How I long for a soothing herbal tea!"" As if by magic, the tent flap opened and Hassan entered, carrying a cup of steaming tea which he handed to Poirot. It turned out to be chamomile tea, a drink that Poirot absolutely adored.",1
"Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.” Black was straightforward enough over the matter. “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what” “What has it got to do with Mr.",1
"“After receiving the devastating news from his friend, the nephew tragically took his own life. Despite Mr. Bleibner's lack of a will, his fortune would ultimately be inherited by his nephew and then passed on to the doctor.” “As for Mr. Schneider, his involvement remains uncertain. Considering his acquaintance with young Bleibner, he may have had suspicions. Alternatively, the doctor could have orchestrated another death to further fuel superstitious beliefs. Additionally, I must share an intriguing psychological insight, Hastings. A murderer often feels compelled to reenact their crime, becoming increasingly consumed by the act itself.",1
"“She disappeared that night, where she went is a mystery.” “She was on the island the whole time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man?” “Yes.” “Quite scandalous,” I remarked. “Pagett will be scandalized. He always disapproved of Anne Beddingfeld. Was that the young man she was meant to meet in Durban?” “I doubt it.” “Only share what you wish,” I encouraged. “I suspect this is a young man we should all be eager to find.” “Really?” I exclaimed, feeling anticipation rise. He confirmed. “Harry Rayburn, also known as Harry Lucas, that’s his true identity. He has slipped through our fingers again, but we will catch him soon enough.”",1
"""You understand the nature of women. She's enthusiastic about the film stunt."" ""I see,"" replied Poirot. After a moment of contemplation, he quickly stood up. ""Are you heading back to Yardly Chase immediately? Good! Don't inform anyone except for expecting us there this evening. We will be there shortly after five."" ""Okay, but I'm not sure"" ""It doesn't matter,"" said Poirot kindly. ""You want me to keep your diamond safe, right?"" ""Yes, but"" ""Then just follow my instructions."" A confused nobleman exited the room. We reached Yardly Chase at five-thirty, and were led by the dignified butler to the antique panelled hall with its crackling fire.",1
"""But now everything is clear to me."" ""You have all the answers?""""I have unraveled what M. Renauld wanted me to uncover.""""And you know who the killer is?""""I am aware of one killer.""""What are you trying to say?""""We seem to be talking past each other. There are not one, but two crimes here. I have cracked the first, but as for the second, well, I must admit, I am uncertain!""""But, Poirot, didn't you claim that the man in the shed died of natural causes?""""Tsk tsk tsk."" Poirot let out his signature sigh of impatience. ""You still don't grasp it. A crime can exist without a murderer, but in the case of two crimes, two bodies are indispensable.""",1
"No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",1
"Poirot and I arrived in Saint-Omer, where Jack Renauld was being held. The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, welcomed us and expressed his frustration with the clever but rude detective Giraud. Poirot remained cautious, not revealing his suspicions about the case. The magistrate mentioned that Jack had been uncooperative and silent during questioning. Madame Renauld, still unconscious, was in a delicate state. As we discussed the case, M. Hautet remembered a letter for Poirot that had arrived earlier. It was from an unknown woman, written in a flowing foreign hand. Poirot pocketed the letter, thanked the magistrate, and we left the room.",1
"""Oh, Minks had one of his best performances disguised as Miss Pettigrew, and he does a rather impressive imitation of my voice.” “I have a question.” “Go ahead.” “How did you convince Pagett to hire her?” “Well, it was quite easy. She bumped into Pagett in the entrance of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever he happened to be, told him I urgently called down, and that she had been chosen by the relevant Government department. Pagett believed her without a second thought.” “You're very open,” I remarked, observing him closely. “There's no reason for me not to be.” The reassurance didn't sit right with me.",1
"""She entered the building, and I chatted with the lady at the front desk, acting as if I was accompanying her. Eventually, I made my way inside as well."" He paused, the room filled with an uneasy quiet. ""You have to trust me, Anne. I swear on my life that everything I'm about to tell you is the truth. I followed her into the building with vengeance on my mind, only to discover her lifeless body! I stumbled upon her in that upstairs room, it was a sight straight from hell. Lifeless, and yet I had barely missed her by mere minutes. And there was no trace of another soul in sight! I instantly grasped the dire situation I found myself in.""",1
"Bex, a wrist watch knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without a doubt, and smashed to pieces. They had no idea it would incriminate them. Carefully, he removed the shattered glass fragments. Suddenly, his expression shifted to complete shock. ""Oh my God!"" he exclaimed. ""What's wrong?"" ""The watch hands are pointing to seven o’clock!"" ""Impossible!"" exclaimed the magistrate, surprised. But Poirot, as skillful as always, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary and listened closely. Then, he grinned. ""The glass may be shattered, but the watch is still ticking."" The mystery's solution was met with a sigh of relief.",1
"I decided against taking that path due to its high level of risk. Instead, I adorned my finest hat and made my way somberly through the town to speak with our understandably furious grocer. The sole young man to visit our home was a reporter from the Daily Budget. At moments, I found myself envious of Emily, our young maid, who would stroll out with a handsome sailor she was engaged to whenever the opportunity arose. And in the meantime, to stay practiced as she put it, she would also go out with the greengrocer's assistant and the pharmacist's aide. It made me melancholic to realize that I had no one to practice my social skills with.",1
"I had encountered many individuals in my time, some I had found intriguing, while others left me indifferent. However, none had quite the same air as Mr. Chichester. As I pondered this, Sir Eustace Pedler walked past us on the deck. As he reached Mr. Chichester, he bent down to retrieve a fallen piece of paper, casually handing it back with the simple words, ""You've dropped something."" Without a second glance, Sir Eustace continued on his way, seemingly unaware of the effect his actions had on Mr. Chichester. But I noticed. The sight of that paper seemed to stir something deep within him, his face paling as he balled it up in his hand.",1
"One of the gardeners mentioned seeing a figure heading towards the rose-garden. This figure was spotted from a distance, and the time and identity of the person could not be accurately determined. The gardener noted that it must have been before six o'clock, as that is when they finish working. Mr. Davenheim was last seen leaving the house around half-past five. Beyond the rose-garden lies a lake with a boathouse containing a couple of punts. The possibility of suicide is being considered, and the lake is set to be searched the following day. This new development raises more questions than answers, leaving the case shrouded in mystery.",1
"The cavity was empty save for one thing - a scrap of paper. Poirot's cry of ""Sacré!"" filled the air, his anger palpable. It was evident that someone had beaten us to it. We studied the paper intently, recognizing it as a piece of the puzzle we were trying to solve. Baker's signature was still partially visible, but the contents of the will were nowhere to be found. Poirot, sitting back in frustration, wore a puzzled expression that bordered on comical, if not for the seriousness of the situation. ""I do not comprehend,"" he muttered. ""Who would go to such lengths to destroy this, and for what purpose?"" ""The Bakers, perhaps?"" I suggested.",1
"Then, as he approached the bedside, 'Fear not, Eloise,' he whispered. 'I will be back by morning.' Despite his attempt at reassurance, fear lingered in his gaze. They quickly escorted him out, the tall figure warning, 'A single noise and you're a dead man.' ""Following that,"" Mrs. Renauld recounted, ""I must have lost consciousness. The next memory I have is of Léonie massaging my hands and offering me brandy."" ""Madame Renauld,"" inquired the judge, ""did you have any inkling of what the intruders were seeking?"" ""None at all, sir."" ""Were you aware of any apprehensions your husband harbored?"" ""Indeed. I witnessed the transformation in him.""",1
"""I know where the diamonds are,"" I declared confidently. Sir Eustace's eyes widened in surprise. ""Where?"" he demanded eagerly. ""In a safe place, far away from here,"" I replied mysteriously. ""But I can take you to them, if you agree to let Harry and I go free."" Sir Eustace hesitated, then nodded. ""Deal,"" he said. I led the way out of the room, with Sir Eustace following closely behind. As we walked down the corridor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of triumph. I had outsmarted the cunning criminal and saved the day. The diamonds were safe, and Harry and I were free at last. It was a satisfying end to a dangerous game of cat and mouse.",1
"""I suspect that room is where we will discover Jack Renauld,"" I whispered to Poirot. Madame Daubreuil welcomed us in, mentioning that Jack's condition had not changed much, but she thought we might want to check on him ourselves. Up the stairs we went, entering the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil sat at a table, engrossed in her embroidery under the glow of a lamp. She gestured for silence as we approached. Jack Renauld lay in a restless slumber, his head tossing back and forth, his complexion still unusually red. ""Will the doctor return soon?"" Poirot inquired softly. ""Only if we request it. For now, let him rest,"" Madame Daubreuil replied.",1
"“Miss Beddingfeld, I was indeed there,” Pagett confessed. “I had my own reasons for being in the neighborhood.” “Sir Eustace hasn’t already told you?” “I believe he may have known for years,” Pagett continued. “He seems to take pleasure in keeping me in suspense.”As the whistle blew and passengers returned to the train, Miss Beddingfeld pressed for answers. “Why did you go to Marlow?” Pagett hesitated, then reluctantly shared his secret. Walking back to the hotel, Miss Beddingfeld received a wire with instructions to go to Johannesburg, signed by Harry. Deep in thought, she couldn’t shake off the mystery surrounding Pagett's behavior.",1
"Giraud smiled, then, shifting his position slightly, remarked: “That will be all. I believe you would rather continue the questioning, M. le juge.” “Indeed, that is correct,” replied M. Hautet. “And what led to the disagreement between you?” “I refuse to disclose,” stated M. Renauld firmly. M. Hautet sat upright in his seat. “M. Renauld, it is not acceptable to play games with the law!” he declared. “What was the cause of the argument?” Young Renauld remained quiet, his youthful countenance moody and dark. But another voice intervened, composed and collected, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I can provide the information, if you wish, M.",1
"Pagett abruptly left the table midway through dinner, leaving me slightly irritated since I had intended to bid him farewell. However, I assumed Sir Eustace could serve the same purpose. After finishing my meal, I approached Sir Eustace. ""Farewell, Sir Eustace,"" I declared. ""I depart for Durban tonight."" Sir Eustace let out a weary sigh. ""Yes, I heard about your plans. Would you prefer some company on your journey?"" ""I would appreciate it."" ""Lovely girl. Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather join me in searching for lions in Rhodesia?"" ""Absolutely."" ""The man must be quite dashing,"" Sir Eustace remarked with a hint of sadness.",1
"""Did Renauld prevent Madame Daubreuil from leaving? Had she departed already?"" ""Yes, sir. I overheard them exiting the study and heading towards the door. Monsieur bid her good night and closed the door behind her."" ""At what time did this occur?"" ""Around twenty-five minutes past ten, sir."" ""Do you know when M. Renauld retired to bed?"" ""I heard him ascending the stairs about ten minutes after us. The stairs creak so loudly that one can hear every step taken."" ""And is that all? Did you hear any commotion during the night?"" ""Absolutely nothing, sir."" ""Who was the first servant to come downstairs in the morning?"" ""That would be me, sir.""",1
"I returned from France with her that day, and said goodbye to her at Victoria that evening making it impossible for her to be in Merlinville.” Poirot gave me a thoughtful look. “Would you swear to that in a court of law?” “Absolutely,” I replied. Poirot stood up and nodded. “My friend! Love conquers all! Your plan is quite clever. It even outsmarts Hercule Poirot!” After a period of tension, as I have just described, there is always a moment of relief. I went to bed that night feeling victorious, only to wake up realizing that I was not yet in the clear. Although, I couldn't find any flaws in the alibi I had come up with so suddenly.",1
"I wonder what secrets Pagett is hiding. He always seems to know more than he lets on. But tonight, it's all about the Fancy Dress dance. Mrs. Blair and Race are both on the guest list. The Beddingfeld girl, with those perfect legs, will be joining us as well. Pagett, however, seems to have other plans. Instead, a man named Reeves will be accompanying us. He may be small, but he holds valuable information that I can't afford to miss. The evening promises to be eventful, filled with dancing and champagne. And as for Colonel Race, well, he seems to have some interesting stories to tell. Let's see if I can top them with a tale of my own.",1
"I would have been more content if I could have laid him to rest in a cave adorned with ancient art and tools, but the community's expectations led to a tidy grave (complete with marble slab) in the unattractive local churchyard. The vicar's attempts to offer solace fell short. It was only after some time that I grasped the reality that the independence I had always yearned for was now mine. Despite being an orphan with little money, I was finally free. Simultaneously, I recognized the remarkable compassion of these generous individuals. The vicar made a strong appeal for me to assist his wife who was in immediate need of a companion.",1
"Poirot's eyes narrowed as he stared at Dr. Ames, his green cat-like gaze unwavering. ""Do you not believe in Ancient Egypt, monsieur le docteur?"" he asked softly. Dr. Ames, taken aback, stammered for a response. Poirot, without waiting for an answer, inquired about the thoughts of the native workmen. ""I guess they're getting scared,"" Dr. Ames admitted. ""But they've no reason to be."" Poirot's expression remained inscrutable as Sir Guy expressed disbelief in Poirot's ideas. With a swift movement, Poirot produced a tattered book titled The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans. Without a word, he left the tent, leaving the doctor puzzled.",1
"We conducted a thorough assessment of the situation during our initial evening together. Our conversation lasted for hours. It was evident to me that a combination of defensive and aggressive strategies would be essential. I felt secure traveling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his group. With both him and Colonel Race by my side, I knew I had strong protection. I assumed my adversaries would be reluctant to provoke a confrontation. Furthermore, being close to Sir Eustace meant I was also connected to Guy Pagett, who was at the center of the enigma. I questioned Suzanne about the possibility of Pagett himself being the elusive “Colonel.""",1
"What was the reason she stayed there? Was it in the hopes of encountering Jack Renauld? I had informed her (believing it at the time) that he was traveling to Buenos Ayres by sea. Perhaps she knew that the Anzora had not departed. But in order to be aware of that, she must have seen Jack. Was this what Poirot was investigating? Had Jack Renauld, coming back to meet Marthe Daubreuil, unexpectedly run into Bella Duveen, the woman he had callously abandoned? It was starting to make sense. If that was the situation, it could provide Jack with the alibi he was searching for. However, his silence in that case appeared to be quite puzzling.",1
"""There are certain situations where a man may choose to wear pajamas with an overcoat, while the other option remains highly unlikely,"" I replied. Poirot interjected, ""We must redirect our focus to unraveling the enigma of the unlocked door. I am quite certain that they did not exit through the door; the window was their means of escape."" Surprised, I questioned, ""The window?"" Poirot affirmed, ""Exactly."" I countered, ""But there were no footprints in the flower bed below."" Poirot nodded, ""Indeed, and there should have been. Consider this, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, mentioned that he had planted both flower beds the day before.""",1
"The officer and the small man were walking across the street when they spotted me. The man pointed me out to the officer excitedly. Without hesitation, I sprinted away, underestimating the officer's speed. As I ran down Adderly Street, I could feel the eyes of the onlookers on me, anticipating someone to intervene. Desperation set in, and I blurted out, “Where's the station?” Gasping for air, I followed the directions and dashed towards it, hoping to catch a train. Suddenly, I heard rapid footsteps approaching from behind. To my dismay, the little man with the prominent nose was right on my tail, proving to be a remarkable sprinter.",1
"""But imagine if you had actually married that little doctor of yours. It's a good thing you didn't - he doesn't seem like the type who would appreciate having explosives lying around the house! Are you planning to inform Lord Nasby about this?"" I shook my head. ""Yet you still think he's innocent?"" ""I've seen innocent people get punished before."" ""Well, Anne, you need to accept the possibility. Despite your beliefs, he could very well be the one who committed this murder."" ""No,"" I stated firmly. ""He's not the one."" ""You're letting your emotions cloud your judgment."" ""No, I'm not. He may have had a reason to harm her, but he didn't.""",1
"“Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it.",1
"""You can mock all you want, but I refuse to be the next target of that cursed Men-her-Ra. If I stay here, he will come after me."" The young man wiped his brow, sweat dripping down his face. Poirot looked away, a strange smile playing on his lips. ""Don't forget, he claimed a victim in New York,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Oh, damn!"" Mr. Harper exclaimed forcefully. ""That young man is clearly on edge,"" Poirot observed thoughtfully. ""Teetering right on the edge."" I glanced at Poirot, intrigued by his mysterious smile, but it revealed nothing. Accompanied by Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill, we were guided through the excavation site.",1
"He made his way to the boathouse, changed into his disguise that had been cleverly stashed away, disposed of his original clothes in the water, and proceeded with his scheme by selling the ring in a conspicuous manner, then instigating a scuffle with a police officer, ensuring his retreat to the sanctuary of Bow Street, a place no one would think to search for him! ""It's inconceivable,"" Japp muttered. ""Just ask Madame,"" my companion replied with a grin. The following morning, a certified letter awaited Poirot at his spot at the table. Upon opening it, a five-pound note slipped out. A look of concern creased my companion's forehead.",1
"Mrs. Middleton, the quiet housekeeper, had disappeared without a trace, leaving behind only her box of ordinary clothing. Mrs. Havering, her employer, had hired her through Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street, but it turned out that no such woman had ever been registered with the agency. Poirot, the astute detective, quickly realized that Mrs. Middleton was just a clever disguise used by Mrs. Havering, an actress, to provide herself with an alibi during the murder of Mr. Harrington Pace. The truth unraveled as Poirot meticulously explained the sequence of events, revealing the hidden connections and deceptions that led to the crime.",1
"""Did you know,"" I suddenly interjected, ""that Guy Pagett was present in Marlow when the murder took place?"" ""That changes everything. I was under the impression he was in Cannes with Sir Eustace."" ""He was believed to be in Florence but it turns out he never actually traveled there. My hunch is that he was indeed in Marlow, although I lack concrete evidence."" ""It's unbelievable that I never suspected Pagett until the night he attempted to push you off the boat. He's quite the talented actor."" ""Indeed, he is."" ""This would explain why the Mill House was selected. Pagett likely had the ability to enter and exit without being noticed.""",1
"""I am conducting an investigation into the passing of Mr. Renauld. Surely, you are aware of it?"" She nodded silently, her face remaining impassive. ""We have come to inquire if you might shed some light on the events surrounding it?"" ""Me?"" Her tone conveyed genuine surprise. ""Indeed, madam. It would be preferable if we could converse in private."" He gestured discreetly towards the young woman. Madame Daubreuil glanced at her. ""Marthe, my dear."" But the young woman refused. ""No, mother, I will stay. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I have no intention of leaving."" Madame Daubreuil then redirected her attention to the investigator.",1
"""I was."" As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. ""You didn't help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?"" I replied coldly, ""M. Poirot has gone to Paris. And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police."" Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. ""They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better.""",1
"Poirot's experience as an examining magistrate gives him a discernment and flair that sets him apart. He is polite in an old-school manner and willing to help his friend in any way. Poirot and his friend encounter Giraud, who is dandified and pleased with himself. Giraud teases Poirot about his return from England and his confidence in solving the case. Poirot challenges Giraud to a wager to find the murderer first, showing a dangerous light in his eyes. Despite Giraud's insults, Poirot remains determined to prove Jack Renauld's innocence. The encounter with Giraud has put Poirot on edge, making his intentions clear to his friend.",1
"""Blair, my dear lady, I must say, your observation about Mr. Pagett is quite intriguing,"" remarked Sir Eustace, with a hint of amusement in his voice. ""Indeed, his face does not inspire confidence in his innocence, does it?"" Mrs. Blair gave a knowing nod, and Colonel Race chimed in, ""Six years is quite a long time to have someone so invaluable in your service, Sir Eustace."" The conversation flowed effortlessly, with mentions of dancing, ghosts in cabin 17, and the mysterious Mr. Chichester. As the evening progressed, secrets and suspicions lingered in the air, leaving Sir Eustace pondering the true intentions of those around him.",1
"Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair greeted me warmly, prompting me to approach them. The conversation revolved around Italy. “It’s deceptive,” Mrs. Blair argued. “Aqua calda should definitely mean cold water, not hot.” “You’re not a Latin expert,” Sir Eustace teased, grinning. “Men always act so superior when it comes to Latin,” Mrs. Blair remarked. “Yet, I can't help but notice that when asked to translate inscriptions in old churches, they often struggle! They stumble over words and find ways to avoid it.” “Absolutely,” agreed Colonel Race. “That's my tactic.” “Regardless, I have a soft spot for the Italians,” Mrs. Blair added.",1
"But the suffering of the heart, monsieur, does it not weigh heavily? Day after day, I witnessed Madame's gradual decline in health. She was a mere shadow of the woman who had first graced our presence a month earlier. Monsieur, too, was not immune to change. His demeanor hinted at deep-seated troubles, teetering on the edge of a nerve-wracking crisis. And who could blame him, given the scandalous nature of the affair? No sense of discretion or restraint. Certainly not the English way!” My blood boiled at the injustice, yet the magistrate pressed on with his interrogation, unwavering in his pursuit of the truth. “You claim that M.",1
"He concealed his thoughts so cleverly behind those impenetrable dark eyes. He unnerved me a bit. He had always unnerved me. I never could figure him out. We silently ascended until we arrived at the location where Rhodes is protected by massive rocks. A peculiar, eerie location, far from civilization, that sings an endless song of rugged magnificence. We lingered there for a while in quietude. Then descended once again, but veering slightly from the trail. At times it was a difficult climb and at one point we encountered a steep incline or cliff that was nearly vertical. Colonel Race led the way, then offered a hand to assist me.",1
"""At the stroke of three, we found ourselves back at Charing Cross station. Despite our protests, Poirot remained steadfast, insisting that starting at square one was not a futile endeavor, but rather the only logical course of action. During our journey, he had a hushed conversation with Norman, who promptly sent off a flurry of telegrams from Dover. Thanks to Norman's connections, we breezed through each checkpoint with unprecedented speed. Upon our arrival in London, a sleek police vehicle awaited us, accompanied by plain-clothed officers. One of them passed a typed document to Poirot, silently answering my unspoken question.""",1
"""I must confess, Monsieur Poirot, that I have a rather pressing matter to discuss with you today,"" the young woman stated with a polite nod as she took her seat. ""I assume you are familiar with the recent headlines regarding the theft of Liberty Bonds at the Olympia."" Poirot's expression betrayed a hint of surprise, prompting her to elaborate without delay. ""You may be wondering what a person like myself has to do with the esteemed London and Scottish Bank. The truth is, Monsieur Poirot, I am actually engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway."" ""Ah, Mr. Philip Ridgeway,"" she continued. ""He happened to be the custodian of the stolen bonds.""",1
"“Insisting on coming straight to me was the right call,” he continued. “Minks may be a clever actor, but he’s a fool. That person you saw downstairs? That was Minks.” I responded weakly, “Oh, really.” Sir Eustace then cheerfully said, “Now, let’s talk facts. How long have you known I was the ‘Colonel’?” I replied, “Ever since Mr. Pagett mentioned seeing you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace ruefully nodded, “Yes, I told that fool he had messed up. He didn’t get it, though. All he cared about was whether I recognized him. Never crossed his mind to question what I was doing there. Just plain bad luck.”",1
"""The length of a clue, my friend, holds significance regardless of its size - a two-foot clue is just as crucial as one that measures two millimeters! It is a misconception that only tiny clues are important. As for the lead-piping, dismissing its relevance simply because Giraud said so is a mistake. Let us not discuss this further. Let Giraud continue his investigation, while I pursue my own thoughts. The case appears to be clear-cut, and yet, my friend, I am not convinced. Do you know why? It all comes back to the wristwatch that is two hours ahead. Additionally, there are a number of peculiar details that do not quite align.""",1
"He simply took her away! Upon her arrival in England, she was completely devastated, yet somehow still alive.” Poirot solemnly shook his head. I tried to keep a straight face. Suddenly, he froze and pointed dramatically at the toast rack. “Ah, for example, this is too much!” he exclaimed. “What's wrong?” “This piece of toast. Do you not notice it?” He grabbed the culprit from the rack and displayed it for me to see. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? No. Is it even round? No. Does it have any shape that is remotely pleasing to the eye? What kind of symmetry is this? None.” “It's sliced from a cottage loaf,” I explained calmly.",1
"Poirot and I sat on the grassy knoll facing the sea, reviewing the case of Jack Renauld. I pondered over the details, considering Madame Daubreuil's connection to the Beroldy Case. Suddenly, a thought struck me - Georges Conneau. Poirot was impressed by my revelation, encouraging me to continue. We assumed Conneau was alive and had a vendetta against Renauld, leading to a fatal encounter. Madame Daubreuil's involvement and a cover-up scheme unfolded in my theory. Poirot, however, pointed out the unrealistic aspects of my reconstruction, suggesting it belonged in the movies. I defended my theory, but Poirot's skepticism lingered.",1
"""He retreated and I was left to process this piece of information. Who was the mysterious woman who visited my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My expression darkened as I grasped the cleverness and boldness of my unidentified enemies. Gathering my thoughts, I exited my cabin and headed towards Mrs. Blair's. I rapped on the door. “Who is it?” her voice called out from inside. “It's Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I stepped inside. Various articles of clothing were strewn about, and Mrs. Blair was adorned in a stunning kimono. The colors of orange, gold, and black in the garment made my mouth water as I admired it.""",1
"""Listen, my friend, I understand your feelings on this dreadful matter. I have not handled it well! If you were in my position, you might have handled it better! Fine! Let's move on from it and grab some lunch."" By the time we arrived at Poirot's place, it was around four o’clock. A man stood up from a seat near the window. It was Lord Yardly. He appeared worn out and troubled. ""I received your message and hurried here. I went to Hoffberg, but they deny any knowledge of their employee from last night or the telegram. Could it be that"" Poirot interrupted him. ""I apologize! I sent that telegram and recruited the man in question.""",1
"""Now, let's talk about our targets. Mr. Chichester is heading to Durban. Sir Eustace plans to stay at the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town before heading to Rhodesia. He even offered me a spot in his private rail car after a few too many glasses of champagne the other night. I doubt he meant it, but he'll have to follow through if I remind him."" ""Sounds good,"" I replied. ""I'll focus on keeping an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, while you handle Chichester. What about Colonel Race?"" Suzanne gave me a strange look. ""Anne, you can't seriously suspect-"" ""I do. I suspect everyone. I'm in the mood to consider the most unlikely person.""",1
"Had my obsession with the smell of moth balls gone too far? I thought I was imagining things when I detected the familiar scent on the roll of films as well. Holding them up to my nose only confirmed my suspicions. There was definitely a strong smell of moth balls lingering on them. But upon closer inspection, I discovered a tiny piece of cloth stuck on a rough edge of the film reel, saturated with the unpleasant odor. It became clear that the films had once been in the overcoat pocket of the man who met his end in the Tube. But how did they end up here? It couldn't have been him - his every move had been traced and documented.",1
"How much did Poirot really know? Was he aware that my fellow passenger on the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same person? What was the reason for his visit to the Hôtel du Phare? Was it truly on my behalf, as I had initially believed? Or was I simply being naive, and was there a more sinister motive behind his actions? Regardless, why was he so determined to locate this young woman? Did he suspect her involvement in Jack Renauld's murder? But that couldn't be possible! She had no reason to harm the victim, no motive for his death. So why did she return to the scene of the crime? I meticulously reviewed all the details.",1
"I am eager to uncover the secrets that Pagett was hiding during his time in Florence. His behavior always takes a turn whenever Italy is brought into the conversation. Despite his reputation for respectability, I can't help but wonder if there is a darker side to him. The thought of Pagett harboring a guilty secret is both thrilling and intriguing. The events of the evening have been nothing short of strange. While visiting the barber's shop, the only outfit that fit me was a Teddy Bear costume. Although I enjoy playing pretend with young women back home, dressing as a bear is far from ideal for the warm climate of the equator.",1
"I had a feeling of unease regarding Bella. Her infatuation with Jack Renauld was so intense that she would have done anything for him. However, when Jack's behavior towards her changed and he stopped communicating as frequently, Bella became increasingly agitated. She became convinced that he had feelings for another woman, a suspicion that was later proven to be true. Despite my objections, Bella decided to travel to their Villa in Merlinville to confront Jack. Aware of her intentions, she attempted to evade me. Upon discovering that she was not on the train in Calais, I made the decision not to proceed to England without her.",1
"I implored her to confide in me. Unbeknownst to many, the depth of their affection had been put to the ultimate test and emerged unscathed. Both had shown a willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for one another."" As for the modest chronicler Captain Arthur Hastings, what fate awaited him? Rumors circulated about his potential departure to join the Renaulds on a distant ranch, but for the conclusion of this tale, I choose to revisit a morning in the peaceful garden of Villa Geneviève. ""It feels strange to address you as Bella,"" I remarked, ""knowing that it is not your given name. And Dulcie, well, it feels equally foreign.""",1
"Not until I reached the pier, after enduring the tedious formalities demanded by bureaucratic red tape, could I finally relax. No one had been arrested, and as I basked in the glorious weather, my hunger became apparent. Suzanne and I would be spending the night at the hotel. The boat wasn't departing for Port Elizabeth and Durban until the next morning. We hailed a taxi and headed to the Mount Nelson. The day was absolutely delightful - the sun, the breeze, the blooming flowers! Compared to the dreary January days in Little Hampsly, with its muddy terrain and constant rain, I couldn't help but revel in my current surroundings.",1
"Renauld plans to disguise himself as a tramp and leave town unnoticed after the crime is supposed to have taken place. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, leaving her with the same story as before. He intentionally leaves evidence against himself and is ultimately caught. Poirot praises Renauld's wife for her strength and resilience in the face of tragedy. Poirot and Hastings discuss the case further, focusing on the lead piping and the possibility of a witness. They travel to England to find Bella Duveen, a potential key witness. They track her down to a theater in Coventry, where she performs as part of the Dulcibella Kids act.",1
"""Absolutely no blame can be placed on him, as it was in no way his fault. Nonetheless, he is feeling quite distressed about the situation, and I have reason to believe that his uncle may have inadvertently mentioned that he had them in his possession. This incident is a major setback for his career."" ""And who might his uncle be?"" ""Mr. Vavasour, the co-general manager of the London and Scottish Bank."" ""Miss Farquhar, would you mind telling me the entire story?"" ""Certainly. The Bank was looking to expand their credit operations in America, and to do so, they made the decision to transfer over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds.""",1
"“Anne,” Suzanne whispered urgently, glancing around anxiously for eavesdroppers. “A distinctly good idea,” Anne approved, nodding. Suzanne explained how the big cases were sent to Cape Town and the small ones were likely with Sir Eustace. Anne decided to wait until further action was necessary. The next day, she planned to meet Guy Pagett to find out more. Anne received instructions to go to Johannesburg urgently. Anne listened to Pagett’s story about his trip to Marlow, trying to understand his mysterious behavior. Pagett revealed a surprising secret about his past, leaving Anne shocked. Anne pondered her next move carefully.",1
"I have informed Mr. Blair that he needs to handle some rare and valuable curios in Cape Town. Miss Pettigrew and I are leaving for an adventure together. The situation in Johannesburg is tense, with strikers causing chaos in the streets. I met Reeves, who is now retracting his inflammatory speeches. The Government suspects a secret organization behind the unrest. A Government official hinted at trouble and offered to send me to Pretoria. Anne is safe in Kimberley, much to my relief. Race and I discussed Anne's mysterious disappearance. Suzanne expressed concerns about her marriage. The conversation then turned to the diamonds.",1
"Man is a creature of habit. Habitual in his lawful routines, just as predictable in his unlawful activities. When a man breaks the law, his subsequent transgressions tend to mirror the original offense. Take for instance the notorious English killer who eliminated his spouses one after the other by drowning them in their own tubs. If he had only diversified his tactics, perhaps he could have evaded capture indefinitely. However, he fell victim to the conventional patterns of human behavior, convinced that past methods would guarantee future success. And so, he ultimately suffered the consequences of his unimaginative approach.",1
"Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one.",1
"""It appears highly probable that Pagett is responsible for the murder of Anita Grünberg in Marlow, adding credibility to the idea that he is indeed the elusive 'Colonel.' Given the sensitive nature of Anita's work, it seems unlikely that she would confide in a subordinate. The only factor contradicting this hypothesis is the failed attempt on your life the night you arrived here. Pagett was clearly left in Cape Town, making it impossible for him to have reached this location before the following Wednesday. It is doubtful that he has any associates in this area, as all his preparations were made to intercept you in Cape Town.""",1
"""There was just a single diamond, my friend! Originally part of the Yardly collection, it has now been in Mr. Rolf's possession for three years. He managed to steal it this morning using a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! I must say, watching him on the film, he truly is an artist. “But why would he steal his own diamond?” I inquired, feeling confused. “For various reasons. Firstly, Lady Yardly was becoming impatient.” “Lady Yardly?” “You see, she was often left alone in California. Her husband was off having fun elsewhere. Mr. Rolf, on the other hand, was quite attractive and had a hint of romance about him.""",1
"The Grand Duke of Russia, court intrigues, and political plots all pointed back to the mysterious woman herself! She was the mastermind behind the clever deceptions, manipulating others to part with their money under false pretenses of possessing the legendary ""Crown jewels,"" which turned out to be nothing more than worthless imitations. Her entire life story was exposed without mercy. The reason behind the murder was connected to a man named Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Despite his efforts to evade the truth, Mr. Trapp eventually confessed that he harbored feelings for the woman and would have proposed marriage if she were available.",1
"Upon our return to London, my eyes were drawn to a striking foxhound figurine displayed proudly on Poirot's mantelpiece. Poirot confirmed my unspoken question with a nod. ""Ah, yes! I have received my 500 francs! Isn't he magnificent? I have christened him Giraud!"" A few days passed before Jack Renauld visited us, his countenance determined. ""M. Poirot, I bid you farewell. I am setting sail for South America imminently. My father had extensive business dealings on the continent, and I am eager to forge a new path there."" ""Will you be traveling alone, M. Jack?"" ""My mother accompanies me, and Stonor will remain as my secretary.""",1
"""Are you certain about the date of the crime?"" questioned the magistrate. ""Yes, it was the morning of June 8th when we received the news,"" replied the railway official. A second official was summoned to corroborate the testimony. Jack Renauld was then pointed out by the officials. ""These men have positively identified you. What do you have to say for yourself?"" asked the magistrate. Jack simply shrugged in response. M. Hautet shared a knowing look with the greffier before noting down the answer. ""Renauld, does this item look familiar to you?"" The magistrate picked up an object from the table and presented it to the prisoner.",1
"“But did you really believe her when she said the letters were destroyed? Women never destroy letters if they can help it. It’s not in their nature.” “I know, I know,” I replied, feeling my frustration growing. “But you’ve completely embarrassed me! From start to finish! No, it’s easy to come up with excuses after the fact. There has to be a line somewhere!” “You were having such a good time, my friend. I couldn’t bring myself to ruin it for you.” “It doesn’t matter. You’ve crossed a line this time.” “Oh dear! Why do you get so worked up over nothing, my friend?” “I’ve had enough!” I stormed out, slamming the door behind me.",1
"""You’re youthful, Anne, and possess a striking beauty that drives men to madness. The world lies ahead of you, filled with love, life, and endless possibilities. Whereas mine is a scorched wasteland, tainted with bitter ashes.” “If you no longer desire me” “You know I crave you. I would willingly sacrifice my soul to hold you in my arms and shelter you from the world forever. Anne, you are a temptation. Your enchanting witch-like hair, your eyes that shimmer with golden, brown, and green hues, always laughing even when your expression is serious.

"A journal can be a tool for documenting the peculiarities of others, but not one's own."" ""However, there is such a thing as unintentional self-disclosure."" ""In the view of a psychoanalyst, everything is considered vile,"" I stated in a knowing tone. ""I imagine you've had quite the adventurous life, Colonel Race?"" inquired Miss Beddingfeld, fixing him with a mesmerized gaze. This is how they operate, these women! Othello captivated Desdemona with his tales, yet, oh, didn't Desdemona captivate Othello with her attentive demeanor? Anyway, the young woman certainly piqued Race's interest. He proceeded to recount tales of bravery.",1
"I could only imagine what Miss Pettigrew must have been thinking. For her to assume that I had the habit of summoning Anne Beddingfeld out of thin air at midnight was beyond absurd. Such a notion could be damaging to a man of my standing. ""I assume,"" I remarked icily, ""that she is in her own bed at this hour."" I cleared my throat and directed a pointed look at Miss Pettigrew, indicating my readiness to continue dictating. Hopefully, Mrs. Blair would pick up on the hint. Unfortunately, she did not. Instead, she collapsed into a nearby chair and anxiously gestured with her slippered foot. ""She's not in her room. I've checked.""",1
"I was trapped by my captor, a man who clearly had been following my every move. Despite my attempts to reason with him, he seemed determined to keep me captive. I found myself bound and gagged in a dusty attic, completely at his mercy. As the night wore on, I struggled against my restraints, desperate for a way out. And then, in the dim moonlight, I spotted a glint of broken glass in the corner. An idea began to form in my mind. Despite the pain and stiffness, I knew I had to try. Slowly, I started to roll towards the glass, inching closer with every agonizing movement. It was a risky plan, but it was my only hope of escape.",1

""But why was the radio message referring to 'seventeen' instead of 'seventy-one'?"" ""I have a theory.

I revisited the case and came to the same conclusion - it had to be either Bella Duveen or Marthe Daubreuil. The letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie gave me the breakthrough I needed. The missing dagger, stolen by Dulcie Duveen, revealed the true culprit. With some discreet guidance, the pieces fell into place and Marthe Daubreuil's true colors were exposed. It was a risky move, but it paid off. The events unfolded just as I had anticipated, and Marthe Daubreuil's attempt to claim the Renauld fortune was thwarted.""",1
"Did her smile vanish, her heart gripped by nameless fear? Or did she ascend the stairs, still smiling, unaware of the impending doom? My heart quickened. Was the house truly deserted? Was doom lurking for me as well? For the first time, I grasped the significance of the oft-used term, ""atmosphere."" There was a sense in this house, a sense of malice, of threat, of malevolence. Pushing aside the oppressive emotions, I ascended the stairs swiftly. Finding the room of the tragedy posed no challenge. On the day the body was found, a heavy rain had fallen, leaving behind large muddy footprints on the bare floor in all directions.",1
"I had my suspicions about him, particularly his unwavering insistence on Cabin 17. Maybe it was just his stubborn nature shining through. Stubbornness can be quite the trait. It wouldn't hurt to have a chat with Mr. Chichester, I thought to myself. After a quick fix to my unruly hair, I made my way back up to the deck, determined. Luck was on my side. I spotted my target by the rail, sipping on beef tea. Stepping closer, I addressed him. ""I trust you've let go of the Cabin 17 issue,"" I ventured, flashing a smile. ""I believe holding grudges goes against the grain of true forgiveness,"" Mr. Chichester replied, his tone chilly.",1

""But how did the intruder gain entry?"" ""Through here."" ""But this door is always secured."" I disagreed. ""Not anymore. Look."" I swung it ajar while speaking. A piece of fabric drifted to the floor as I did so. I retrieved it. The silk was intricately embroidered, clearly ripped from a Chinese garment. ""It got caught in the door in his hurry,"" I deduced. ""Quick, let's go. He couldn't have gotten far."" Yet despite our efforts, our search yielded no results.",1
"""I overheard the conversation."" ""What did you hear?"" ""It was rather heated. Shortly after, there was a commotion. Running into the hallway, I nearly bumped into Mrs. Middleton.

By the time we made it inside, the killer had already fled. Unfortunately, my uncle,"" she hesitated, ""was found with a fatal gunshot wound to the head. I immediately instructed Mrs. Middleton to contact the authorities. I made sure not to disturb anything in the room, leaving it undisturbed as I discovered it.""",1
"""The sea, oh the sea!"" he cried, his voice filled with lament. A week had passed since then, the golden sand of the desert beneath our feet. The blazing sun beat down relentlessly. Poirot, looking utterly miserable, withered by my side. Travel was not his forte, the four-day voyage from Marseilles had been pure torment for him. Upon landing in Alexandria, he was but a shadow of his former self, even his usual impeccable appearance had faded. Our destination was Cairo, and we immediately made our way to the Mena House Hotel, nestled in the shadow of the Pyramids. Egypt's allure captivated me, but Poirot remained unaffected.",1
"Dressed identically to his attire in London, he always kept a small clothes-brush in his pocket to combat the dust that clung to his dark clothing. “And my boots,” he lamented. “Look at them, Hastings. My boots, usually gleaming patent leather, now filled with sand both inside and out, a painful sight. In addition, this heat is causing my once impeccable moustaches to droop in defeat!” “But look at the Sphinx,” I suggested. “Even I can sense the enigmatic allure it emits.” Poirot gazed at it disapprovingly. “It appears quite unhappy,” he observed. “Partially buried in sand in such a disorderly manner, how could it not be?”",1
"I could not help but feel unsettled by the encounter with Marthe and Jack Renauld. Their whispered conversation hinted at hidden fears and secrets, leaving me with more questions than answers. As I walked away from the scene, my attention was caught by a peculiar sight near the hedge. What appeared to be a bush turned out to be Giraud, the detective, signaling for silence. With a stern expression, he chastised me for interrupting their conversation, revealing his true intentions. Our encounter left me even more curious about the mysteries surrounding the young couple and the tragic events that seemed to bind them together.",1

"""Let's go back to the hotel for lunch,"" Poirot suggested, looking at his watch. As we walked, Poirot suddenly stopped to measure an overcoat. Confused, I asked why, but Poirot simply replied, ""To see how long it is."" His mysterious behavior irritated me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Mrs. Renauld was hiding something. Poirot agreed, revealing his suspicions about her involvement in the crime. He explained that the crime actually took place two hours earlier than believed, based on the condition of the body. Mrs. Renauld had lied about the time, and someone had tampered with the wrist watch to create a false alibi.",1
"""Pagett, my dear,"" I exclaimed, ""why must the unfortunate fellow be shadowed every time he steps on deck? Some individuals even endure the discomfort of sleeping outside. I've always found it rather unpleasant. The crew hoses down the deck, along with anyone on it, at five in the morning."" The very thought made me cringe. ""In any case,"" I added, ""if you insisted on disturbing some unfortunate soul suffering from insomnia, it's no surprise he lashed out at you."" Pagett appeared understanding. ""Allow me to explain, Sir Eustace. I was certain the man had been lurking near your cabin, where he had no legitimate reason to be.""",1
"""When you were assigned to this case, did you turn up your nose and claim it was distasteful, and you wanted no part in it?"" ""No, but"" ""If you were here on vacation, wouldn't you be investigating just like I am? Of course you would."" ""I'm a man. You're a woman."" ""Your view of a woman is someone who jumps on a chair and screams at the sight of a mouse. That's outdated. But you will give me a tour, won't you? You see, it could greatly benefit me."" ""How so?"" ""They've barred all the journalists. I could have a major exclusive with one of the newspapers. You have no idea how much they pay for insider information."" I hesitated.",1
"I didn't waste any time considering Anne's potential motives for her deceptive remarks. Instead, I relished the opportunity to outsmart Race, who was overly self-assured. Pulling the telegram from my pocket, I presented it to him. ""Care to explain this?"" I inquired casually. His reaction was one of utter shock. ""She claimed she was just setting out for Beira,"" he mumbled, clearly perplexed. Despite Race's reputation for intelligence, I found him to be rather dense. He seemed incapable of grasping the fact that women don't always tell the truth. ""And Kimberley as well. What could they possibly be up to there?"" he grumbled.",1
"I was relieved when the man, Chichester, and the Dutchman left the house. I waited for a while before making my move. The hall was empty, so I quickly unlatched the door and stepped outside into the sunshine. I ran down the drive and headed towards Cape Town. After a short while, I reached a garage and asked for a car to take me to catch the boat to Durban. I had to find out if Chichester was on board. As I drove towards the docks, I realized that the Kilmorden Castle was already sailing away. My only hope was to sail after him and confront him about the diamonds. I decided to sail to Durban and see what awaited me there.",1
"Just as I was beginning to doubt my eyes, a figure entered the room with such vigor that for a moment I thought the dead had risen. It was only when I noticed the absence of any trace of age on his dark hair that I realized it was a mere youth standing before us. Ignoring the onlookers, he made a beeline for Mrs. Renauld. ""Mother!"" he exclaimed. ""Jack!"" she cried out in return, embracing him tightly. ""What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be sailing on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago?"" After a moment, she composed herself and introduced him to the others with a hint of pride, ""Gentlemen, this is my son.""",1
"""And their offspring behaved much like children do today, amusing themselves with handfuls of pebbles, stacking them and then toppling them over. The more skillfully they stacked the stones, the more delighted they were. If I were to label this area, I would dub it ‘The Land of Oversized Children.’"" ""You may be closer to the truth than you realize,"" Colonel Race remarked solemnly. ""Uncomplicated, basic, vast that is Africa."" I nodded in agreement. ""You have a fondness for it, don't you?"" I inquired. ""Indeed. However, residing in it for an extended period well, it instills a sense of what you might consider ruthlessness.""",1
"""Feel free to tell the story in your own words,"" I encouraged, as he continued: ""Arriving in Kimberley, we were filled with pride over our discovery. Carrying a valuable collection of diamonds, we sought the opinion of experts. It was at the Kimberley hotel where we encountered her."" My body tensed slightly, my hand gripping the doorpost unconsciously. ""Anita Grünberg, an actress. Youthful and strikingly beautiful. Though born in South Africa, her mother hailed from Hungary. There was an air of mystery surrounding her, adding to her allure for two young men fresh from the wilderness. It seems she had no trouble at all.""",1
"""I basked in the satisfaction of knowing that Marchaud considered me as significant as Poirot. The girl awaited my arrival, her reaction effusive upon spotting the key in my possession. “You have it then?” she exclaimed. “Naturally,” I replied calmly. “Nonetheless, what I am about to do is rather unorthodox.” “You have been most helpful, and I will remember it. Let us proceed. Are we shielded from view by the house?” “Just a moment.” I halted her eager progression. “I will not impede you if you truly desire to enter. But do you? You have observed the grave, the grounds, and have been briefed on all aspects of the case.""",1
"""They’re just acquaintances, really, even Suzanne. The person who penned that note must have possessed a vast amount of insider information. It certainly wasn't the work of an outsider,"" I calmly mentioned the note this time, without a trace of embarrassment. ""If you were to follow my advice,"" he began, pausing. ""I doubt that I will,"" I responded honestly. ""But I'm willing to listen."" ""Do you always follow your own desires, Miss Beddingfeld?"" ""Typically,"" I cautiously replied. With anyone else, I would have said ""Always."" ""I feel sorry for your husband,"" he unexpectedly remarked. ""There's no need for that,"" I shot back.",1
"Harry took a moment to collect his thoughts before continuing. ""I was deeply in love with her, so much so that it scared her at times. But his love for her was different - quieter, yet more profound. She was his everything, and her betrayal shattered his world. The pain was so intense, it left him unable to move."" Harry fell silent for a moment, then resumed speaking. ""You see, I was declared 'Missing, presumed dead.' I never bothered to correct the mistake. I adopted the alias Parker and sought refuge on this familiar island. Initially, I had hoped to clear my name during the war, but now that determination had faded.""",1
"His corpse was discovered in the shed adjacent to the crime scene, having succumbed at least two days prior. It is highly likely that he suffered a stabbing wound akin to M. Renauld, although not necessarily to the rear."" I was taken aback and taken aback I was. Throughout my experience with Poirot, he had never executed something as astonishing as this. And, almost inevitably, a suspicion crept into my thoughts. ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""you're teasing me. You must have already been informed."" He fixed his sincere gaze on me disapprovingly. ""Would I stoop to such deceit? I can assure you that I am completely uninformed.""",1
"Lady Willard was deeply concerned about her son's safety after her husband's death, believing that an occult influence may be at play. Poirot, surprisingly superstitious, promised to protect her son. Lady Willard revealed details about the members of the expedition, including the American secretary, Harper. Poirot cabled New York for information on young Mr. Bleibner, who had a troubled past and had recently been in Egypt. Poirot considered the possibility of a more modern crime, involving poison and remorse. He decided to travel to Egypt to investigate further, much to the dismay of his travel-worn companion, Hastings.",1
"Poirot was the one to reveal the shocking truth to Jack Renauld. Despite the difficult revelation, Jack found strength with his mother's support. Poirot also convinced Mrs. Renauld to disclose her secret to Jack, revealing his father's dark past as a fugitive. Poirot ensured that the truth remained hidden from the world, sparing Jack and his family from shame. Jack later decided to start a new life in South America, accompanied by his mother. Poirot encouraged Jack to seek out his love and face the future with honesty and courage. In the end, Poirot and Hastings shared a moment of lighthearted observation in the garden.",1
"The appearance of ‘the Western Star’ on the date coincided with Lord Yardly preparing to settle down. The possible sale of the diamond posed a threat, leading to a double robbery plan by Gregory Rolf. Lady Yardly, fearing exposure, stages a robbery herself. Hercule Poirot uncovers the truth by observing the facts. The lady's deception is exposed, revealing a well-orchestrated scheme. Poirot's clever manipulation forces Rolf to hand over the stolen diamond. Mary Marvell's innocence is highlighted, while Lady Yardly is exposed as the true culprit. The complex web of lies and deceit is unraveled, leaving no stone unturned.",1
"""I appreciate your concern,"" I responded, trying to mask my frustration. ""Miss Emery, the governess, is resigning."" Mrs. Thompson, the employer, hesitated before asking, ""Since your search hasn't yielded results, would you consider staying on permanently?"" Surprised by the offer, I realized it was out of kindness rather than genuine desire. Overwhelmed with guilt for judging her unfairly, I rose from my seat and embraced her. ""You're too kind,"" I whispered gratefully. ""But I have plans to leave for South Africa this weekend."" My unexpected show of affection caught Mrs. Thompson off guard, unaccustomed to such displays.",1
"As I turned around, a voice startled me: “Apologies, Miss Beddingfeld, but I am heading towards the station. Would you and Mrs. Blair like a ride?” “Oh, I appreciate the offer,” I responded quickly. “But it's really not necessary, I” “No trouble at all, I insist. Porter, please load the luggage.” Feeling trapped, I could have argued further, but Suzanne's subtle gesture cautioned me to stay alert. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I replied coolly. We all piled into the car. Racing towards town, I struggled to find conversation. Finally, Pagett broke the silence. “I've found a competent secretary for Sir Eustace,” he mentioned.",1
"In contrast, I found myself silently pleased. I am not a complete idiot. ""Nevertheless,"" I stated seriously, ""I believe we will."" ""Why?"" I shook my head, unable to articulate the emotion behind my words. ""I never want to lay eyes on you again,"" he abruptly and forcefully declared. It was quite impolite, but I merely chuckled quietly and disappeared into the shadows. I heard him begin to follow me, then stop, and a single word drifted down the deck. I believe it was ""witch""! (Extract from the journal of Sir Eustace Pedler) At the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town. It is truly a huge relief to disembark from the Kilmorden.",1
"Nadina proudly revealed her cunning plan to the Count, explaining how she had outsmarted the 'Colonel' by keeping back some unique South American diamonds as leverage. She confidently declared that she was not afraid of the 'Colonel,' dismissing any concern about being blackmailed. The Count warned her of the dangers of underestimating their adversary, but Nadina was confident in her abilities. She mentioned a man arriving from Africa at her request, who had carried out her orders and happened to be her husband. The Count questioned her about the man's trustworthiness, to which Nadina responded with a mysterious smile.",1
"""But what was the true intent? What was the real purpose scheduled for one o’clock in Cabin 17? It couldn't have been the secretary's stabbing. Scheduling it for a specific hour on a specific day in a specific location would serve no purpose. No, it must have been some sort of meeting and he was en route to attend it when he was attacked. But who was the meeting with? Definitely not with you. It could have been with Chichester. Or perhaps with Pagett.” “That doesn't seem likely,” I interjected, “they could meet at any time.” We both fell silent for a couple of minutes, then Suzanne veered off in a different direction.",1
"“I couldn’t sleep. I was restless, disturbed, had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream,” he explained. “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I inquired. He looked embarrassed. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death,” he responded with a tinge of bitterness.",1
"“I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again.",1
"""I'm about to share a different side of the story,"" I declared confidently. Harry's attention was unwavering as I detailed the same sequence of events chronicled in this book. The most shocking revelation for him was the revelation that the diamonds had been in Suzanne's possession all this time, a fact that had completely eluded him. After hearing his version of events, I finally understood the purpose behind Carton's clever scheme, or rather Nadina's, as I was convinced it was her ingenious plan all along. It became clear that no surprise attacks against her or her husband would lead to the recovery of the diamonds.",1
"""Why did you take the dagger?” I inquired curiously. She responded with the innocence of a child: “I was worried about fingerprints being left on it.” “But didn’t you wear gloves?” She shook her head in confusion, then whispered hesitantly: “Are you planning to turn me over to the authorities?” “Never in a million years.” Her gaze met mine, filled with uncertainty, and she timidly asked: “Why?” It was an unexpected moment for a confession of affection, and I had never envisioned love finding its way to me in such circumstances. Yet, I replied sincerely and without hesitation: “Because, my dear Cinderella, I love you.”",1
"I reached out with a trembling hand, my heart racing as I grasped it. The weight was unexpected, sending a jolt of excitement through me. Carefully, I removed the adhesive plaster sealing it shut. As I lifted the lid, a cascade of dull glassy pebbles spilled out onto the surface. ""Pebbles,"" I muttered, my disappointment palpable. ""Pebbles?"" Suzanne exclaimed, her voice filled with disbelief. ""Not pebbles, Anne! Diamonds!"" Diamonds! The word echoed in my mind as I gazed at the glimmering heap before me. Each stone appeared unassuming, like a shard of glass. ""Are you certain, Suzanne?"" I inquired. ""Absolutely, my dear.""",1
"""I have my suspicions about Guy Pagett and his time in Florence,"" said Sir Eustace, watching his secretary's hasty departure. ""Every time Italy comes up, he's out the door before you can blink."" ""Maybe he's got a murder or two under his belt from his days there,"" Mrs. Blair chimed in optimistically. ""I hate to say it, Sir Eustace, but he does have that look about him."" ""Oh, definitely a classic Cinquecento villain! It's quite amusing really, especially knowing how law-abiding and decent he actually is,"" Sir Eustace replied. ""He's been by your side for quite a while now, hasn't he, Sir Eustace?"" Colonel Race inquired.",1
"""Let them ascend,” declared Poirot, neatly tucking away his grey pants. Within moments, the two guests were shown in, and my pulse quickened as I realized that the first was none other than Lord Estair, Head of the House of Commons; his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I was aware, a trusted confidant of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” inquired Lord Estair. My companion nodded. The distinguished gentleman glanced at me and paused. “This is a matter of confidentiality.” “Feel free to speak in front of Captain Hastings,” my companion reassured, gesturing for me to stay.",1
"“Not the venom of the Borgias,” Poirot responded, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Your mind is racing. I would suggest it was French chalk.” “French chalk?” “Yes, cabinet-makers use it for smooth drawers.” I chuckled. “You mischievous one! I thought you were building up to something thrilling.” “Goodbye, my friend. I retreat. I vanish!” He exited, the door closing behind him. With a half mocking, half fond smile, I picked up the coat and reached for the clothes-brush. The following day, without any word from Poirot, I went for a leisurely walk, ran into some old acquaintances, and had lunch with them at their hotel.",1
"Poirot and Giraud were in deep conversation, surrounded by a crowd of curious onlookers. Suddenly, Giraud produced a surprising piece of evidence - a woman's hair coiled around the handle of the dagger. Poirot's interest was piqued as he pondered over the mysterious discovery. ""A woman's hair? Whose could it be?"" he mused. As they left the shed, Giraud's suave voice echoed in Poirot's mind. ""What game is he playing?"" wondered Poirot, intrigued by the unexpected turn of events. Later, over a hearty lunch, Poirot remained lost in thought, his mind clearly preoccupied with unraveling the tangled web of clues before him.",1
"Poirot examined it closely before removing it from the lock. The words ""Key to Roll Top Desk"" were scribbled on it in messy handwriting, a stark contrast to the tidy writing on the other keys. ""This is unfamiliar,"" Poirot remarked with a furrowed brow. ""I would wager that this does not belong to Mr. Marsh. But who else has been inside the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I am not mistaken, is a young woman of precision and organization."" At that moment, Baker entered the room in response to the bell. ""Could you please bring madame your wife and assist with some inquiries?"" Baker left and quickly returned with Mrs.",1
"The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet.",1
"“I guess he had just managed to evade the foreign gentlemen, and my mother probably got the time wrong when they arrived. Or, was it all a setup after all? Did my mother really believe it couldn't have been me?” Poirot quickly reassured him. “No, no, Mr. Jack. Don't worry about that. I will clarify everything for you at some point. It's quite intriguing. But can you please tell us exactly what happened on that dreadful evening?” “There isn't much to say. I had come from Cherbourg, as I mentioned, to see Marthe before leaving for a faraway place. The train was delayed, so I took the shortcut through the golf course.”",1
"As we embarked on our journey, I couldn't contain my excitement. The fresh air filled me with joy and anticipation for the trip ahead. Despite my cheerful outlook, my companion reminded me of the impending task awaiting us at our destination. I waved off his concerns, confident in his ability to unravel the mysteries that lay ahead. With Hercule Poirot by my side, success was surely within reach. But as I teased him about his renowned skills, he simply gazed at me solemnly, sensing something amiss. It seemed as though he saw through my facade, recognizing a sense of foreboding lurking beneath my optimistic demeanor.",1
"Mrs. Blair surprised me the next morning by stopping by my chair after walking on the deck with Colonel Race. She mentioned the idea of a funeral at sea being exciting, but I had recovered from feeling ill. Colonel Race and Mrs. Blair then suggested I change to a better cabin, as there were plenty available. Mrs. Blair tried to take a photograph of the Grand Peak of Tenerife, but her camera was set on 'bulb' mode the whole time. As she reached for the rail, the roll of films fell overboard. The sound of a bugle announced lunch, which Mrs. Blair eagerly welcomed after only having two cups of beef-tea since breakfast.",1
"""But M. Giraud could not be deceived,"" whispered Poirot. ""You may try to deceive me, but I have one final undeniable piece of evidence. Madame Renauld's entire story was a lie, crafted from the very beginning. Despite her supposed love for her husband, she lied to protect his killer. A woman will lie for herself, for the man she loves, or for her children. This is the undeniable truth. You cannot deny it."" Giraud stopped, looking pleased with himself. Poirot met his gaze calmly. ""That is your argument,"" Giraud stated. ""What do you have to say in response?"" ""Only that there is one crucial detail you have overlooked.",1
"""He observed a figure emerging from Sir Eustace’s quarters and trailed him to the upper deck. Does that align with his statement? Now, who resided in the cabin across from Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Imagine if Colonel Race stealthily ascended to the deck, and, thwarted in his assault on you, hastily circled the deck and encountered Pagett just entering through the saloon entrance. He strikes him and swiftly retreats inside, shutting the door behind him. We rush over and discover Pagett sprawled on the floor. What do you make of that?” “You overlook the fact that he adamantly insists it was you who struck him down.""",1
"""We opened the gate and proceeded up the narrow path towards the oak door, when a familiar figure appeared and approached us. “Japp!” I exclaimed. The Scotland Yard inspector smiled warmly at me before turning to my companion. “Mr. Havering, correct? I’ve been dispatched from London to oversee this investigation, and I would appreciate a moment of your time, sir.” “My wife” “I have already spoken with your wife and the housekeeper. I won’t detain you long, but I am eager to return to the village now that I have completed my examination here.” “I am not yet aware of the details” “Exactly,” Japp replied reassuringly.",1
"A large settee covered in chintz was positioned against the far wall, while the window seats were also draped in the same faded fabric. Poirot, cigarette in hand, emphasized the need to meticulously search the room for clues, particularly in the desk. The key to the desk, labeled in a messy handwriting, raised suspicions. After questioning the Bakers, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen from Plymouth to create a hidden compartment in the fireplace. Coghan, one of the workers, disclosed the intricate details of the job. Excitedly, Poirot and I returned to explore the hidden cavity.",1
"Maltravers, a man with a young and beautiful wife, seemingly gathered all his available funds to pay for a life insurance policy for her before taking his own life. This scenario, although tragic, is not unheard of in our society. A friend of mine, Alfred Wright, who happens to be a director at Northern Union, has urged me to look into the details of this case. However, I must admit that I am not particularly optimistic about uncovering the truth. If the cause of death had been listed as heart failure, I might have been more hopeful. The term ""heart failure"" often serves as a convenient cover-up in such situations.",1
"""Get going immediately.” “Make sure to bundle up, sir,” the young aviator advised. “I can offer you a coat, if needed.” Poirot checked his bulky timepiece. He muttered under his breath: “Just enough time, just enough.” Then, he raised his head and courteously nodded to the young man. “I appreciate it, sir. However, I am not the one you will be flying. This gentleman here is your passenger.” With those words, he stepped aside, allowing a figure to emerge from the shadows. It was the second male captive who had departed in the alternate vehicle, and as his face was illuminated, I couldn't help but gasp in disbelief.",1
"""They're not the hands of a gentleman,"" he stated, in response to my gaze. ""In fact, his attire suggests he's a man of means. Quite intriguing, wouldn't you say?"" ""Intriguing indeed,"" I concurred. ""And there's no identifiable markings on any of his clothes. What can we deduce from that? This individual was attempting to present himself as someone else. He was pretending. But why? Was he running from something? Was he trying to evade capture by assuming a different persona? At this point, we can only speculate. However, one thing is certain - he was just as determined to hide his true self as we are to uncover it.""",1
"Poirot felt sympathy for the unfortunate lady, but his loyalty lay with the Insurance Company. As he prepared to depart, he whispered to Mrs. Maltravers: “Madame, you must understand, there are no true endings.” “What are you implying?” she asked, her gaze filled with fear. “Have you ever delved into the world of spiritualism? You possess a unique gift.” “I have been told as much. But surely you do not believe in such things?” “Madame, I have witnessed the inexplicable. Rumor has it that this house is plagued by spirits.” She nodded in agreement, just as the parlourmaid appeared to announce that dinner was served.",1
"The prisoner, Jack Renauld, remained stoic as he faced the magistrate's questions. Witnesses from the train station positively identified him as being at the scene of the crime. When presented with the aeroplane dagger, Jack calmly admitted it was his own design and a gift to his mother. Despite his lawyer's protests, Jack seemed determined to take control of his own defense, even at the risk of his own fate. It was clear that he was willing to sacrifice himself to protect someone he once loved. The task of securing his acquittal would be a daunting challenge, one that would require facing the harsh truth head-on.",1
"""As I opened the door to turn on the lights, a sudden darkness enveloped the room. Lady Yardly's scream pierced the air as the necklace was violently torn from her neck. In the chaos, we found the necklace abandoned near the side door, missing the Star of the East. A piece of silk from a Chinaman's robe caught in the door revealed the thief's identity. In a panic, the thief escaped into the night. The police were summoned, and Lady Yardly recounted the attack. Just as hope seemed lost, news arrived that Miss Marvell's diamond had also been stolen. My warnings had been ignored, and now the consequences were dire.""",1
"""Jewel thefts, counterfeiting, espionage (especially lucrative in times of conflict), acts of sabotage, discreet murders - there is barely a crime he hasn't dabbled in. Cleverest of all, he knows exactly when to step back. Things start to get risky? He bows out gracefully with a hefty sum of money!"" ""Hm,"" the Count responded with uncertainty. ""It's rather disconcerting for all of us. We're left in limbo, so to speak."" ""But we're being compensated generously!"" Her tone carried a hint of sarcasm, prompting the man to give her a sharp look. She was grinning to herself, and the nature of her grin piqued his interest.",1
"""The issue you wish to discuss with him is grave?” “Absolutely! Last night, my uncle, who is my closest friend, was brutally murdered.” “Here in the city?” “No, in Yorkshire. I was in town when my wife sent me a telegram this morning. As soon as I received it, I decided to come and ask Monsieur Poirot to handle the investigation.” “Excuse me for a moment,” I interjected, struck by a sudden thought. I hurried upstairs and quickly briefed Poirot on the matter. He anticipated my next words. “I understand. You want to lead the investigation yourself, correct? Well, why not? You are familiar with my techniques by now.",1
"“The rug by the fireplace is out of place,” he pointed out, pausing to adjust it. Suddenly, he straightened up with a gasp. Clutched in his hand was a tiny torn piece of paper. “Seems the French, much like the English, tend to neglect sweeping beneath the rugs!” Bex handed me the scrap, prompting me to take a closer look. “Does this ring a bell, Hastings?” I shook my head, feeling a sense of déjà vu with the pink hue of the paper. The inspector was quick to connect the dots. “A torn piece of a check,” he declared. The scrap was roughly two inches square, with the word “Duveen” inked onto it. “Good,” remarked Bex.",1
"And the woman disappeared into thin air. Her box was left behind, containing only ordinary apparel. Mrs. Havering hired her through Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency with impeccable references. Mrs. Middleton's sudden disappearance raised suspicions, leading to an investigation. It was discovered that no woman named ""Mrs. Middleton"" had ever been registered with the Agency. Poirot deduced that Zoe Havering, a former actress, had orchestrated the whole scheme. She had disguised herself as the housekeeper to provide an alibi for her mistress. The clever and daring Zoe had fooled everyone with her quick changes and deception.",1
"I'll be curious to see if the tools are from the Mousterian period. There will likely be remains of the primitive ox, but probably not of the woolly rhinoceros. A small group will be leaving soon. We need to stay ahead of them. Will you send a letter to Cook’s today, Anne?” “What about finances, dad?” I asked subtly. He gave me a disapproving look. “Your perspective always brings me down, my dear. We mustn't be materialistic. No, no, one mustn't be materialistic in the pursuit of knowledge.” “I have a feeling Cook’s might be materialistic, dad.” Dad looked hurt. “My dear Anne, you will settle the bill with cash.”",1
"""Both individuals are currently in a state of suspension. I have shed my skirts and my fabric as well. Why not take a seat?” I calmly settled into a chair. “It appears,” I observed, “that I may have arrived at an incorrect location.” “Unfortunately, from your perspective, that seems to be the case. Miss Beddingfeld, falling into the same snare twice!” “Not the wisest move on my part,” I confessed humbly. There was something about my demeanor that seemed to puzzle him. “You don’t appear to be bothered by what happened,” he dryly remarked. “Would a dramatic reaction from me make any difference to you?” I inquired.",1
"""I must say, the masterminds behind this heinous act were incredibly thorough. The victim was pierced with his own blade and destined to rest with his own shovel. They were determined to erase all evidence! However, I refuse to be outwitted. There is always a clue to be found! And I will uncover it."" Poirot's attention seemed to shift to something else entirely - a small, discolored segment of lead piping resting near the shovel. He gently prodded it with his fingertip. ""Could this also be linked to the deceased?"" he inquired, his tone carrying a hint of sarcasm. Giraud simply shrugged, showing his indifference.",1
"“I need to find out who unfastened them,” “I have to make my way to Rhodesia,” Mrs. Blair declared. “After the information you shared, Colonel Race, I feel compelled to go. But it's a dreadful journey, five days on the train.” “You should accompany me in my personal railway carriage,” I suggested politely. “Oh, Sir Eustace, that's so kind of you, are you serious?” “Am I serious!” I responded indignantly, taking another sip of champagne. “In just under a week, we'll arrive in South Africa,” Mrs. Blair lamented. “Ah, South Africa,” I mused wistfully, recalling a recent speech I had given at the Colonial Institute.",1
"""I won't be long,"" I said in a drowsy state as the landlady informed me of a visitor. Lady Yardly, a well-known figure, entered and we discussed the mysterious blackmail letters regarding a diamond. Lady Yardly revealed that her letters came by post and had an Eastern scent, similar to Miss Marvell's. We tried to make sense of the situation but couldn't. Lady Yardly decided to leave, leaving me to inform Poirot. He returned and was intrigued by the case, deciding to involve Lord Yardly. Poirot believed the diamond was in danger of being stolen, but didn't elaborate. Lord Yardly arrived, puzzled by the situation.",1

And luckily, you haven’t missed anything important during this period.” “That’s correct.

"""That’s no ordinary match, not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Fortunately, it remains unlit. Otherwise, I wouldn't have recognized it. Clearly, one of the men tossed away his cigarette end, and lit another, dropping one match out of the box in the process.” “And the other match?” inquired Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he used to light his cigarette. Have you found that as well?” “No.” “Maybe you didn’t search thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly.” The detective appeared on the verge of losing his temper, but managed to keep his composure. “I see you enjoy a good joke, M. Poirot.”",1
"""Then it's settled on the maid,” declared the inspector, satisfied, before resuming his search. Moving on to the maid’s bedroom next door, Poirot furrowed his brow in thought. Abruptly, he turned to Mr. Opalsen with a pointed question. “Was this necklace insured, no question about it?” Mr. Opalsen appeared slightly taken aback by the inquiry. “Yes,” he replied with hesitation, “that is correct.” “But why does it matter?” Mrs. Opalsen interjected tearfully. “I want my necklace back. It was one of a kind. No amount of money could replace it.” “I understand, madame,” Poirot reassured her. “I understand completely.”",1
"Poirot shot me a scathing look. ""My dear Hastings, what a brilliant mind you possess!"" he sneered. ""Don't you understand that I have expressly forbidden such a loaf - a loaf so haphazard and misshapen that no self-respecting baker would dare to bake it!"" Trying to change the subject, I asked casually, ""Anything noteworthy in the mail today?"" Poirot shook his head in disappointment. ""I have yet to peruse my correspondence, but these days nothing of significance ever seems to arrive. The masterminds, the methodical criminals, they are simply nonexistent. The recent cases I have taken on have been utterly mundane.""",1
"The individuals responsible for packing the items have described them as having a unique and challenging shape, requiring custom-made cases. Mrs. Blair has been made aware that transporting these items home will come at a high cost. Meanwhile, Pagett is eager to reunite with me in Jo’burg, but I plan to keep him in Cape Town under the guise of overseeing Mrs. Blair's cases. I have instructed Pagett to ensure the safe handling of the cases, emphasizing the rare and valuable contents. With everything settled, Miss Pettigrew and I embark on our journey together, which, to any observer, appears entirely above board.",1
"""But Poirot's skills surpassed mine. In mere moments, he uncovered the entire tale, his eyes gleaming with amusement. “Ah! A story filled with romance. What is the name of this captivating young woman?” I had to admit that I was unaware. “Even more romantic! The initial encounter on the Paris train, the subsequent one here. Journeys conclude with lovers’ reunions, is that not the saying?” “Stop being ridiculous, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle Cinderella! Truly, you possess the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You ought to establish a harem!” “It’s easy for you to mock me.""",1
"""I couldn't believe my eyes,"" I said, shaking my head in disbelief. Pagett triumphantly held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap. ""What on earth would a woman be doing with these?"" I thought to myself, silently chuckling at Pagett's ignorance. Despite his insistence, I couldn't agree that these items were definitive proof of Miss Pettigrew's gender. Pagett's outdated views never ceased to amaze me. I half expected him to pull out a cigarette case next to further support his argument. But even Pagett had his limits. ""Still not convinced, Sir Eustace?"" he asked, holding up the article for my inspection.",1
"""You will have a Military officer and a C.I.D. man by your side, ready to assist you in any way. Does that meet your requirements?"" ""Certainly. Before you go, gentlemen, may I ask why you chose to seek me out? I am but a stranger in this vast city of London."" ""We were directed to you by a prominent figure from your homeland, based on his strong recommendation."" ""Ah, my dear old friend the Préfet?"" Lord Estair shook his head. ""Someone even higher than the Préfet. A figure of great authority in Belgium, whose power will be restored! An oath that England has taken!"" Poirot's hand swiftly rose in a dramatic salute.",1
"The lady occupying the cabin on the Kilmorden was Mrs. Blair, who interviewed the purser upon boarding. The steward mistook her for the real lady in question, Carton, who arranged a transaction involving diamonds. As the ship approached Cape Town, Miss Beddingfeld grew suspicious of Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace, and his secretary, Mr. Pagett. A conversation about Florence revealed Mr. Pagett's uneasiness, prompting Miss Beddingfeld to confront him about a possible guilty secret. Despite his initial reluctance, Mr. Pagett eventually opened up about his experiences in Italy, including the pictures and olive trees.",1
"“Excuse me, Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Please, have a seat. You got my message. I am determined to solve this puzzle. You can help me in some way. Let's start. You and a companion went to see the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th.” The Italian reacted angrily. “That never happened. I testified in court” “Exactly, and I suspect that you lied under oath.” “Are you trying to intimidate me? Ha! I have nothing to hide. I have been cleared of all charges.” “Indeed; and since I am not foolish, I am not threatening you with punishment but with exposure.",1
"”Mrs. Robinson paused for a breath, then continued: “We expressed our gratitude and explained that we understood it might not work out, but we still wanted to place an order just in case. We promptly took a taxi to No. 4 on the second floor. While waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson, a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, who was also in the market for an apartment, hurried down the stairs. ‘You’re a step behind this time, my dear,’ she remarked. ‘Unfortunately, it’s already been rented.’ It appeared hopeless, but John suggested that since the rent was so low, we could offer more money, possibly even a premium.”",1
"""Poirot checked the time on his oversized pocket watch. “It's almost nine o’clock.” “Twenty-four hours,” Mr. Dodge mused. “And a quarter,” Poirot corrected. “Don’t overlook the quarter, sir, it might be important. Now, let’s talk about the abduction. Did it happen in England or France?” “France. Mr. MacAdam traveled to France this morning. He was supposed to spend the night as a guest of the Commander-in-Chief before heading to Paris tomorrow. He was ferried across the Channel by a destroyer. Upon arrival in Boulogne, he was greeted by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.""",1
"I reached my destination early the next morning, where I was greeted by a mysterious Dutchman with a short black beard. Without a word, he ushered me into a waiting car and we sped off. In the distance, a strange booming sound echoed through the air, prompting me to inquire about its origin. ""Guns,"" was his curt reply. The realization that there was conflict in Jo'burg sent a thrill through me. Our target, it seemed, lay hidden somewhere in the city's suburbs. With each turn and detour we took, the sound of gunfire grew louder, heightening the tension. Finally, we came to a stop in front of a rundown building.",1
"In the cozy study, we found a charming couple - the man with a weathered face resembling a withered apple, and his wife exuding a sense of calm with her ample frame. Exhausted from the journey and the long drive, we had quickly retired to bed after a delicious meal of roast chicken, apple pie, and thick Devonshire cream. After a satisfying breakfast, we gathered in the small, wood-paneled room that once belonged to the late Mr. Marsh. A roll-top desk, meticulously organized with papers, adorned one wall, while a large leather armchair, clearly the favorite spot of its former owner, sat prominently in the room.",1
"Nonetheless, the case came back to me with surprising clarity. It had caused quite a stir in the past, extensively covered in the English newspapers. Remembering the key details required little effort on my part. In my current state of exhilaration, everything seemed to fall into place. I must confess, I tend to act on impulse, a habit that Poirot often criticizes. However, in this particular instance, I believe my hastiness was justified. The way in which this new revelation aligned with Poirot’s perspective was truly remarkable. Without hesitation, I turned to Poirot and exclaimed, “Congratulations, Poirot.""",1
"""We were unceremoniously escorted out. 'I am not satisfied,' Poirot murmured, stepping onto the sidewalk. 'Were you hoping for more revelations? Those old codgers are not exactly a thrilling bunch.' 'It's not their lack of excitement that bothers me, my friend. I am not anticipating a Bank manager to embody a 'sharp-eyed financial wizard' as your beloved novels portray. No, I am let down by the simplicity of the case!' 'Simple?' 'Indeed, isn't it almost laughably easy?' 'You already know who took the bonds?' 'I do.' 'Then why must we...?' 'Don't get ahead of yourself, Hastings. We are to remain idle for now.""",1
"At the stroke of eleven, a telegram arrived from Poirot: ""Instruct Japp to detain housekeeper at once."" I was shocked, but wasted no time in delivering the message to Japp. He muttered a curse, acknowledging Poirot's reputation. ""If he insists, there must be a reason. I barely gave the woman a second thought. I may not arrest her, but she will be closely monitored. Let's head up there now and conduct a thorough search."" Unfortunately, it was already too late. Mrs. Middleton, the unassuming middle-aged housekeeper who had seemed so ordinary, had vanished without a trace. Only her abandoned belongings remained.",1
"He was a villain indeed, but his charm was undeniable. I kept my true feelings hidden, aware that Colonel Race had a different perspective. Despite the escape being expected, I doubted they would catch him. I maintained a lukewarm response, and the conversation faltered until Colonel Race inquired about Harry. I informed him of Harry's absence and his clearance of suspicion. Then, Colonel Race dropped a bombshell, revealing Harry's true identity as John Harold Eardsley. My mind raced, questioning everything Harry had told me. His deception was finally exposed, leaving me torn between forgiveness and betrayal.",1
"It was clear that Luigi Valdarno and Miss Elsa Hardt were involved in a complex web of espionage. The mysterious disappearance of Miss Hardt and the sudden death of Valdarno raised suspicions about their true identities. Poirot and I embarked on a risky mission to uncover the truth. As we waited in the shadows, a faint noise alerted us to the presence of an intruder. Poirot's quick thinking and my steady hand led to the capture of the man, who turned out to be an Italian, not a Japanese spy as previously suspected. Our journey to a remote house in St. John's Wood only added to the mystery unfolding before us.",1
"Poirot calmly explained the intricate plan that M. Renauld had devised, ensuring that he would appear to die without actually perishing. The body of the tramp was manipulated to serve as a decoy, while M. Renauld planned to escape to another country under an assumed identity. Madame Renauld was to play the part of the grieving widow until they could reunite in secret. The details were meticulously arranged, from altering the will to staging the body with the aeroplane dagger. The truth behind the elaborate scheme was slowly unraveling, revealing the extent of their desperation and determination to start anew.",1
"Poirot interrupted: “You are wrong. There is one other person who could have taken the dagger.” “You refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in an automobile which had brought him straight from Calais. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night. He concealed the fact which turned suspicion into certainty. Then we found a second victim stabbed with the same dagger. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here can fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only person who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other members of the household.”",1
"""And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no such person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says."" ""It was Dickens,"" I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. ""But what do you mean, Poirot?"" ""I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.""",1
"""They fail to grasp that with my extensive experience as an investigating magistrate, I possess a certain level of insight, a certain intuition. Indeed! I much prefer the courteous manners of the past. So, my dear colleague, do not hesitate to give me any orders. We are both quite knowledgeable, aren't we?"" chuckling heartily, M. Hautet bid us farewell. Regrettably, Poirot's initial comment to me as we walked through the hallway was: ""That renowned old fool! Utterly foolish!"" Just as we exited the premises, we encountered Giraud, looking even more fashionable than before, and thoroughly content with himself.",1
"I wrenched a dagger out of his grasp, and while Poirot revealed his eyes by lowering the scarf covering them but leaving his mouth bound, I raised my gun in plain sight to convey the futility of resistance. As he stopped fighting, Poirot leaned in close to whisper urgently in his ear. Within a minute, the man signaled his understanding. Poirot then gestured for silence and led us out of the apartment and down the staircase. Our prisoner trailed behind, with me bringing up the rear armed with the gun. Once we reached the street, Poirot turned to me. “A taxi is waiting just around the bend. Hand over the gun.”",1
"On my instructions, Mrs. Renauld rejected her son and announced her plan to draft a will the following day that would prevent him from inheriting any of his father's wealth. It was a drastic measure, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was willing to take the chance, although she neglected to mention her change of location. I assumed she assumed I was aware. Everything unfolded as predicted. Marthe Daubreuil attempted one final effort to claim the Renauld fortune and was unsuccessful! ""What truly astounds me,"" I remarked, ""is how she managed to enter the premises without detection. It's truly miraculous.",1
"When the petite man had completed his business with me, he joined his companion, and together they compelled my husband to stand and go with them into the adjacent dressing-room. Despite my overwhelming fear, I strained to listen intently. Their voices were hushed, preventing me from catching their words. However, the dialect was familiar, a corrupted form of Spanish heard in select regions of South America. It was evident that they were pressuring my husband for something, as their agitation escalated with raised voices. The taller man appeared to take the lead. 'You are aware of our demands!' he exclaimed.",1
"With a forceful shove, Poirot sent him tumbling down the stairs. In a matter of moments, all three of us found ourselves indoors, the door swiftly closed and secured. ""This way, quickly."" Poirot gestured towards the nearest room, flicking on the light. ""And you, hide behind the drapes."" ""Yes, sir,"" replied the Italian, vanishing behind the rich rose-coloured velvet that adorned the window alcove. Just in time. A moment later, a woman burst into the room. Tall and fiery-haired, she clutched a scarlet robe tightly around her figure. ""Where is my husband?"" she demanded, casting a fearful glance around the room.",1
"""As the Prime Minister and his secretary, Captain Daniels, traveled back to town after an Audience in Windsor, the car deviated from the main road and was ambushed by masked men. Shots were fired, narrowly missing the Prime Minister, who downplayed the incident as a scratch. The car was later found abandoned outside a suspicious restaurant in Soho, with the chauffeur, O'Murphy, missing. Poirot, asked to investigate, is granted carte blanche to do so with the assistance of a Military officer and a C.I.D. man. The urgency of the situation is evident as uncertainties arise about the loyalty of those involved.""",1
"""Suzanne carefully carved out a space, concealed the diamonds using cotton wool to muffle any noise, and sealed it back up.” Sir Eustace stared at me intently. His response was typical: “I've always despised that cursed giraffe,” he muttered. “It must have been an instinctual feeling.” We were stranded that evening, unable to make our way back to Johannesburg due to the relentless shelling. It seemed we were trapped, as the rebels had taken control of a new section of the city. Our sanctuary was a remote farm about twenty miles from Johannesburg, situated in the open veld. Exhaustion weighed heavily on me.""",1
"""The towering mountains loomed all around us, as we navigated the winding path upwards. “Is this the most efficient train to Rhodesia during the day?” inquired Anne Beddingfeld. “During the day?” chuckled Race. “My dear Miss Anne, there are merely three weekly trains. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Are you aware that we won't reach the Falls until next Saturday?” “We'll certainly be well-acquainted by then,” Mrs. Blair commented slyly. “How long do you plan to stay at the Falls, Sir Eustace?” “That remains to be seen,” I replied cautiously. “What does it depend on?” “How things unfold in Johannesburg.""",1
"""They're always so helpful, even if it can be a bit overwhelming at times. You ask them for directions and instead of a simple 'turn right, then left,' they go on and on with well-intentioned instructions. And if you still look lost, they'll kindly take you by the arm and personally guide you all the way there."" ""Have you had a similar experience in Venice, Pagett?"" inquired Sir Eustace, flashing a smile at his secretary. The question appeared to unsettle Mr. Pagett for some reason. He stuttered and blushed. ""Oh, yes, quite so, er, quite so."" With a mumbled apology, he stood up and abruptly exited the room.",1
"All three individuals had consumed port, and the decanter, only halfway emptied, was placed in front of the central spot at the table. One of them had indulged in a cigar, while the remaining two opted for cigarettes. An elegant tortoiseshell-and-silver box, containing both cigars and cigarettes, was left ajar on the tabletop. I mentally noted these details, though they failed to illuminate the case for me. I pondered on what caught Poirot's attention in these specifics. When I inquired, he responded, ""My friend, you are overlooking the crucial detail. I am in search of something that remains unseen to me.""",1
"I enjoy my exclusive Club, a competitive game of Bridge, a gourmet meal, and a fine glass of wine. I prefer the charm of England during the summer months and the luxury of the Riviera in winter. I have no interest in being part of sensational events. Occasionally, by the fireplace, I don't mind reading about them in the news. However, I draw the line there. My main goal in life is to be completely at ease. I've invested time and money to achieve that, though success is not always guaranteed. Even if I don't seek out excitement, it seems to find me, and I often find myself entangled in unexpected situations.",1
"I had been dancing with Colonel Race several times that evening and we eventually ended up sitting in deck-chairs, engaged in conversation. He seemed to have a lot of knowledge in a particular subject, but I couldn't help but notice a few mistakes he made. One in particular stood out - he referred to the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian, which was a clear error. As I retired to my cabin that night, I couldn't shake the feeling that he might have been testing me, perhaps suspecting that I was not who I claimed to be. It was a puzzling thought that lingered in my mind as I drifted off to sleep.",1
"We were there the next morning for Jack Renauld's examination. He looked drastically different, with sunken cheeks and dark circles under his eyes. He refused to acknowledge being in Merlinville on the night of the crime, insisting he was in Cherbourg instead. The witnesses identified him from the train, and he recognized the dagger found at the crime scene as his own design. Despite the mounting evidence against him, Jack maintained his innocence, stating he did not kill his father. Suddenly, a lady entered the room and confessed to the murder, revealing the truth behind the tangled web of lies and deceit.",1
"""Excuse me."" ""Yes?"" ""Well, he was then forced to disguise himself with a fake beard and wig, had to transform back into his own appearance, and sleeping with a fake beard is no simple task as it increases the risk of being discovered! He could not take the chance of still sharing a room with his wife, Mrs. Davenheim. You confirmed my suspicions that for the past six months, or since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, they had been staying in separate rooms. That was the final piece of the puzzle! The gardener who thought he spotted his employer heading towards the side of the house was indeed correct.""",1
"""Guess what? I'll clear my name or die trying. The scoundrel who tried to murder you will pay,"" he vowed. ""He didn't push you, but he deceived you. Stones on the path were moved, luring you to step into nothingness. I'll find him,"" he promised. Then, in a different tone, he opened up about his past. ""My real name is Harry Lucas,"" he confessed. Raised in Rhodesia, he met Eardsley at Cambridge, bonding over a love for South Africa. Together, they found diamonds in British Guiana, but Anita Grünberg's betrayal led to their downfall. The police seized the diamonds, and Eardsley's influence couldn't save them.""",1
"I couldn't fathom why a conspirator would choose to represent thirteen in such an indirect way in real life. If the intention was to convey thirteen, why not simply write ""13""? The spacing between the digits was deliberate. So, I subtracted twenty-two from one hundred and seventy-one, arriving at one hundred and fifty-nine. After repeating the calculation, the result was a hundred and forty-nine. These mathematical exercises, while beneficial for sharpening the mind, proved fruitless in unraveling the mystery at hand. Setting aside arithmetic, I turned my attention to the words inscribed: Kilmorden Castle.",1
"Since the conclusion of the Conflict, he had resided in at least half a dozen various apartments and townhouses. Almost immediately after settling in a new place, he would stumble upon a different opportunity and promptly move out. Most of his relocations resulted in a small financial profit, showcasing his astute business acumen. However, his primary motivation was the thrill of the chase rather than monetary gain. As we absorbed Parker's words, we were filled with admiration for his expertise. When it was our chance to speak, a chaotic exchange of words ensued. Eventually, Mrs. was the last one standing.",1
"""Absolutely not,"" I stated firmly. ""My great-aunt Jane always used to claim that a true lady remains unfazed by any event,"" I whispered wistfully. ""I strive to embody her teachings."" Observing Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew's thoughts written plainly on his countenance, I felt compelled to continue speaking. ""Your skill in disguise is truly remarkable,"" I complimented sincerely. ""Throughout your time as Miss Pettigrew, I never once suspected, not even when you dropped your pencil in astonishment at my appearance on the train in Cape Town."" He drummed his fingers on the desk with the pencil clutched in his hand.",1
"“Allow me to maintain my little secret. Please give Lady Yardly my deepest respects and inform her of my delight in returning her jewel. Lovely weather today, isn't it? Good day, my lord."" With a smile, the peculiar man escorted the confused nobleman to the door. Returning, he rubbed his hands gently. ""Poirot,"" I inquired. ""Am I losing my mind?"" ""No, my friend, just lost in thought as usual."" ""How did you obtain the diamond?"" ""From Mr. Rolf."" ""Rolf?"" ""Yes! The threatening letters, the Chinaman, the Society Gossip article - all creations of Mr. Rolf's clever mind! The two identical diamonds? Pure fiction.""",1
"""But Sir, he was as dark as a thundercloud all day! Couldn't please him at all!"" The noise of a door closing upstairs interrupted Léonie's chatter. ""And Françoise is waiting for me!"" she cried, suddenly remembering her responsibilities. ""That old one, always scolding."" ""Just a moment, miss. The inspector, where is he?"" ""They went to check the car in the garage. The commissioner thought it might have been used on the night of the murder."" ""What an idea,"" Poirot muttered, watching the girl vanish. ""Will you go out and join them?"" ""No, I'll wait for them in the lounge. It's cooler there on this hot morning.""",1
"""During a fleeting moment, Giraud's visage was veiled by an intense, almost murderous fury. Advancing two paces towards his antagonist, he was abruptly interrupted as Marchaud swung open the salon door and inquired, ""M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?"" The newcomer who crossed the threshold exuded a commanding presence. Towering in height, with a sturdy athletic build, and a deeply tanned complexion, he effortlessly captivated the room. Even Giraud appeared pallid in comparison. It wasn't long before I discerned that Gabriel Stonor possessed a truly remarkable persona.""",1
"""Pugnacious Mac,"" the moniker his colleagues bestowed upon him, vigorously and categorically opposed the rising Pacifist movement. He personified not just the Prime Minister of England, but the essence of England itself; his removal from power would have dealt a devastating and crippling blow to the nation. Poirot, meanwhile, meticulously dabbed at a gray suit with a tiny sponge. Hercule Poirot was the epitome of a fashion-conscious gentleman, with a fervent dedication to tidiness and organization. The scent of benzine permeated the room, making it impossible for him to focus entirely on our conversation.",1
"""Tell me, what has caught your interest?"" I asked confidently, although half-expecting him to mock my suspicions. To my astonishment, he nodded in agreement. ""You are correct, Hastings. I have always had a feeling that she was withholding something. Initially, I had my doubts about her, suspecting her involvement, if not direct, then at least indirect."" ""You suspected her?"" I exclaimed. ""Absolutely! She stands to gain significantly from this new will, being the sole beneficiary. Therefore, she was immediately under my scrutiny. You might have noticed that I made a point of inspecting her wrists early on.""",1
"""What was his next move after leaving the scene, after the alleged murder or, as you claim, discovering the body. Where did he disappear to?” I maintained my silence. “I can't help but wonder,” Suzanne pondered. “Could he have convinced Sir Eustace Pedler to take him on as his secretary? It would provide a rare opportunity to escape England without raising suspicion. But how did he persuade Sir Eustace? It appears he had some leverage over him.” “Perhaps over Pagett as well,” I interjected involuntarily. “You don’t seem to trust Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace praises him as a diligent and competent young man.""",1
"""You will head to Beira.” “I refuse to go to Beira,” I interjected. “You will. You will head to Beira even if I must personally escort you there and force you onto the ship. Do you believe I am made of steel? Do you believe I will endure sleepless nights, dreading they have captured you? One cannot rely on miracles forever. You need to return to England, Anne, marry, and find happiness.” “With a reliable man who will provide me with a stable home!” “It is better than facing complete ruin.” “And what about you?” His expression turned stern. “I have my tasks at the ready. Do not inquire further about them.”",1
"I followed her lead, purchasing a variety of trinkets for a mere “tiki” (threepence) each. The selection ranged from giraffes and tigers to snakes and a forlorn eland, not to mention comical little black warriors. The thrill was palpable as we reveled in the moment. Despite Sir Eustace's attempts to rein us in, our enthusiasm could not be contained. It's a wonder we weren't left stranded at some remote station along the route. South African locomotives depart without fanfare, silently slipping away as you scramble back on board. Suzanne's astonishment at my last-minute boarding in Cape Town was priceless.",1
"Mrs. Renauld glanced at M. Hautet, awaiting his inquiry. ""You had a question for me, M. le juge."" ""If I may, madame. I gather your late husband hailed from French Canadian roots. Can you shed light on his early years or upbringing?"" She shook her head. ""My husband was quite reserved regarding his personal history, sir. He originated from the North West, but I suspect his childhood was fraught with difficulties, as he never broached the subject. Our focus was always on the here and now, looking towards the future."" ""Did he harbor any secrets from his past?"" Mrs. Renauld pondered, her expression unreadable.",1
"Poirot. My fondness for jewelry is well known. Ed always surprises me with a new piece whenever things are going smoothly. Do you have an interest in gemstones?” “I have had my fair share of experiences with them, madame. My line of work has led me to encounter some of the most renowned jewels in the world.” He proceeded to recount, using discreet aliases, the tale of the legendary jewels of a royal family, capturing Mrs. Opalsen's undivided attention. “Oh my!” she gasped, after he finished. “It's just like a scene from a play! You know, I possess some pearls with a fascinating backstory attached to them.",1
"""Of course, it's clear that M. Renauld was involved with the Englishwoman Bella. He arrives, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts a relationship with her. When he loses interest, she becomes suspicious. This letter is a definite threat. Initially, the case seemed simple - jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back initially pointed to a crime committed by a woman."" Poirot agreed. ""Yes, the backstabbing, sure. But the grave! That took effort, it was hard work. No woman could have dug that grave, sir. That was the work of a man."" The commissary responded eagerly: ""Absolutely, you're correct.""",1
"""Suzanne, I believe we've stumbled upon a breakthrough in the case,"" I exclaimed. ""It all revolves around the mysterious appointment in Cabin 17 on the 22nd."" Suzanne's eyes widened in realization. ""Yes, but what about the connection to Madame Nadina, the Russian dancer?"" I paused, struck by a sudden thought. ""What if the films that Mrs. Blair received were meant for Nadina? And what if they were a crucial piece of evidence in this whole tangled web of deceit?"" Suzanne gasped, her eyes alight with newfound understanding. ""It all makes sense now. The answer lies in those missing films. We must find them.""",1
"""Upon Poirot's crest-fallen expression, the magistrate called for Marchaud. 'Please convey my regards to Madame Renauld,' he said, 'and ask if she would spare a few moments to speak with me. Let her know not to trouble herself; I will come up to her.' Marchaud saluted and left. We lingered in anticipation until, unexpectedly, the door swung open and Mrs. Renauld, ashen in her mourning attire, appeared. M. Hautet hastily offered her a chair, expressing his concern, to which she responded with a grateful smile. Stonor, overcome with emotion, clasped one of her hands in his, unable to find the right words.""",1
"“When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?” Detective Brown asked.“It all clicked into place when I started working methodically,” replied the suspect. “The shooting incident just didn't add up, but once I learned that the Prime Minister had traveled to France with a bandaged face, everything fell into place. Then, after checking all the local hospitals between Windsor and London, and finding no one matching the description of the suspect, I knew I was on the right track. It was simple deduction from there on out.”The next day, Poirot presented me with a telegram that had just arrived.",1
"Born in England, he had traveled extensively around the globe. From hunting big game in Africa to living on a ranch in California, he had also conducted business in the South Sea Islands. Serving as a secretary to a prominent railway tycoon in New York, he even spent time with a hospitable Arab tribe in the desert. With precision, he identified M. Hautet. ""Are you the investigating judge on this case? A pleasure to make your acquaintance, M. le juge. This situation is truly distressing. How is Mrs. Renauld holding up? Is she managing to cope with the ordeal? It must have been a tremendous shock for her.""",1
"The idea excites you, I can tell. You always gravitate towards the extravagant and romantic."" The next day found us settled into our temporary residence. The apartment was tastefully decorated. Though it was on the same floor as the Robinsons, it was situated two levels above. The day following our move-in was a Sunday. During the afternoon, Poirot cracked the front door open, then urgently beckoned me over as a loud noise echoed from below. ""Peer down the stairs. Are those individuals your acquaintances? Make sure they don't spot you."" I leaned over the railing. ""Yes, that's them,"" I whispered clumsily.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, everyone fast asleep. Poirot and I stood beneath Mrs. Renauld's open window, waiting. Suddenly, a cry for help echoed through the night, a light flickered in an upper room. Poirot sprang into action, climbing up a tree and through the window. I followed, marveling at Dulcie's acrobatic skills. Inside, Mrs. Renauld was safe, but Marthe Daubreuil lay dead on the floor. Poirot's deduction of the events that transpired that night left me speechless. The murderer had been unmasked, thanks to a clever ruse and a stolen dagger. The night's events were stranger than any dream.",1
"”I was led into a dingy apartment by him, a young Kafir boy carrying my small suitcase, while Sir Eustace, with a polite demeanor, offered to fulfill any of my requests before leaving. A can of steaming water sat on the washstand, prompting me to unpack my essentials. Among them, an unexpected item awaited me inside my sponge-bag - a small pearl-handled revolver. The loaded weapon surprised me, as it was not there when I departed from Kimberley. Despite my initial shock, I couldn't help but feel a sense of security holding it in my hands. In a place like this, such a tool could prove to be quite handy.”",1
"Ah, it was executed with remarkable precision! After setting the clock to 8.47, he violently smashes it and halts time. The one oversight: he neglects to close the curtains. In a real scenario, the curtains would have been drawn once daylight waned. After swiftly informing the lift operator about the guests, he rushes to a phone booth. At almost precisely 8.47, he calls the doctor with his employer's final plea. His plan is so flawless that there is never any investigation into whether a call was made from Flat II at that exact moment. ""Unless Hercule Poirot decides to meddle,"" I remarked sarcastically.",1
"An incredible change had overtaken my companion. His eyes sparkled with anticipation, his chest expanded with pride. ""I've been foolish, my companions! But now I see the light."" Major Norman hurried to the exit. ""I'll fetch the car."" ""That won't be necessary. I won't be using it. Thankfully, the storm has passed."" ""Are you planning to walk, sir?"" ""No, my dear friend. I am not St. Peter. I choose to voyage across the ocean by ship."" ""Across the ocean?"" ""Indeed. To proceed systematically, one must start from the beginning. And the genesis of this case was in England. Therefore, we must return to England.""",1
"As I glanced at him, a sense of deja vu washed over me. His face triggered a memory, but I dismissed it quickly. Glancing down at my watch, I realized time was slipping away. With a swift turn, I headed towards Cape Town. Spotting a tram about to depart, I sprinted to catch it. Footsteps echoed behind me, growing louder. I leaped onto the tram, closely followed by the other runner. It was him - the man from the night before, the one with the distinctive nose. The pieces fell into place - the encounter at the station, the untied shoe on the road. The puzzle was coming together in a rather unexpected way.",1
"I have always been inclined to view work as something that should be taken on with a light and airy touch, if at all! Guy Pagett, on the other hand, is a man of seriousness and dedication. His lack of frivolity makes him a challenging companion. When I suggested he go to Florence, he eagerly accepted, despite the unusual timing. His devotion to guidebooks and galleries made it a worthwhile investment for me. However, our peace was shattered when he informed me of a murder in my house, involving a foreign woman. This unexpected turn of events has led me to reconsider my plans and embark on a new journey.",1
"I made sure to thoroughly search the girl's belongings upon her arrival. ""Where did you suddenly pull that from? It wasn't there a moment ago,"" I questioned. ""Actually, it was,"" she responded calmly. ""I had it hidden in my stocking."" Sir Eustace lamented his lack of knowledge about women, admitting, ""I should have paid more attention to them."" Harry's patience wore thin as he slammed his hand on the table. ""Stop the nonsense. If it weren't for your age, I'd toss you out the window, you scoundrel! Age or no age,"" he growled, taking a few steps forward while Sir Eustace quickly retreated behind the table.",1
"Poirot and I arrived at Marsdon Manor to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had recently insured his life for a large sum of money. The circumstances surrounding his death were suspicious, as he was found with signs of internal hemorrhage and financial troubles. Dr. Bernard, the local doctor, provided us with some information but seemed vague and unhelpful. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was distraught and beautiful, and Poirot handled the delicate situation with his usual tact and charm. Our investigation led to more questions than answers, and as we were leaving, a tall young man approached us.",1
"The Flemmings observed the Daily Budget, which was experiencing a day that resonated deeply with its essence. SHOCKING CONTINUATION OF SUBWAY TRAGEDY. FEMALE DISCOVERED FATALLY WOUNDED IN SECLUDED RESIDENCE. My eyes devoured the words. ""An astounding revelation unfolded at the Mill House, Marlow yesterday. This very Mill House, belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is available for rent without furnishings, and a prospectus for touring the premises was discovered on the person initially presumed to have taken his own life by throwing himself onto the electrified track at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station.""",1
"""I am not sure,"" the boy replied. The table in front of him was cluttered with various items that he absentmindedly played with. Inspector Giraud demanded a response from him, addressing him as M. Renauld. In frustration, the boy angrily knocked a heavy paper-knife off the table. ""Fine, you want to know? Yes, I fought with my father. I probably said all those horrible things you mentioned. I was so mad, I can't even recall my exact words! I was beyond furious - I felt like I could have done something terrible in that moment. Happy now?"" The boy leaned back in his seat, looking flushed and unapologetic.",1
"""The Count surprised me with his cooperation, but the price I had to pay was exorbitant."" ""How did you settle the debt?"" ""I handed over a stack of Italian banknotes with low denominations. The exchange took place on the spot. The incriminating documents were mine. After that, the Count vanished without a trace."" ""Why didn't you reveal these details during your arrest?"" ""I couldn't risk being associated with him given my circumstances."" ""What's your explanation for that fateful evening?"" ""Someone must have masqueraded as me. They left the apartment empty-handed."" Poirot met his gaze and expressed doubt.",1
"And my Reminiscences were coming along splendidly! I had crafted some incredibly clever exchanges between myself and the leaders of the strike. This morning, I found myself face-to-face with a suave, charming, and enigmatic Government official. He subtly hinted at my influential status and hinted that I should relocate to Pretoria, either voluntarily or involuntarily. ""Anticipating some unrest, are you?"" I inquired. His response was deliberately vague, indicating that they were bracing for significant upheaval. I pointed out to him that his Government was allowing the situation to escalate dangerously.",1
"Carton and She had arranged to meet at the location, pretending that their encounter was by chance. They were both there to see the same house and had taken measures to avoid being tracked. Little did Carton know, the person following him was the mysterious 'Man in the Brown Suit.' The shock of this realization caused Carton to panic and make a fatal misstep. Does this all make sense to you, Anne?"" Anne remained silent. ""That's the gist of it. Carton obtained a document from the deceased individual, but in his haste to escape, he accidentally dropped it. He then trailed the woman all the way to Marlow.",1
"I was always the professional in this business, starting as a youngster with a knack for devising clever schemes. I never made the mistake of carrying them out myself - always employing experts. But Nadina was an exception. She knew too much. My downfall was trusting her. Now, reflecting on my failures, I realize where I went wrong. That imbecile Pagett was a pawn in my game, with his poisoner's face and old-fashioned ways. My sense of humor led me to keep him around, even though I knew it was unwise. But I digress. The focus now is on you. Where are the diamonds? Do you trust Harry Rayburn with them?""",1
"My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I am compelled to reach out to you, not solely for the joy of writing, but for the certain delight it will bring you to receive my message. Our mutual acquaintance Race's intellect may not be as sharp as he believes. I am considering naming you as the executor of my literary works. Enclosed is my personal journal. While it holds no appeal for Race and his associates, I believe you may find some passages entertaining. Feel free to utilize it as you wish. Perhaps a piece for the Daily Budget titled ""Encounters with Criminals."" I do insist, however, that I remain the focal point.",1
"""I will see you later,"" he said before quickly leaving the theatre. I made my way to the hotel, heading straight to the sitting-room. Ordering a whisky and soda, I sat down and stared into the empty grate, lost in thought. The door creaked open, and I turned, expecting Poirot. But to my surprise, it was Cinderella who entered. She spoke in a shaky voice, struggling to catch her breath. ""I saw you earlier with your companion. I followed you from outside. Why are you in Coventry? What were you doing tonight? Is he the detective?"" Her cloak slipped off her shoulders, revealing her stage dress underneath.",1
"""That's the kind of secret he would have kept from his wife and four children,"" I said, finally breaking the silence. ""Has anyone else heard about this?"" He shifted uncomfortably under my intense gaze. ""Only Miss Beddingfeld. She showed up at Kimberley Station."" I maintained eye contact, trying to read his expression. ""Sir Eustace, I hope you're not too upset by this revelation?"" ""My friend,"" I replied, ""I must confess that you've truly messed things up!"" I left feeling quite agitated. On my way, I couldn't resist the urge to stop by the corner curio-shop. The owner greeted me warmly, eager to assist.",1
"""Yet another bill. It seems I've developed a taste for extravagance in my later years. Oh, what's this? A note from Japp."" I perked up, intrigued. The Scotland Yard Inspector had previously involved us in some intriguing cases. ""He's simply expressing his gratitude (in his own way) for a small detail I provided in the Aberystwyth Case. I'm pleased to have been able to assist him."" ""And how did he express his thanks?"" I inquired, knowing Japp's style. ""He was gracious enough to commend me for still being a keen player in the game at my age, and he appreciated the opportunity to involve me in the case.""",1
"""I have uncovered the truth,"" she declared confidently. ""You were not in Cannes on January 8th as you claimed, but rather in Marlow. And when Madame Nadina betrayed you, you conspired to eliminate her. The evidence points directly to you as the culprit behind the crime."" Sir Eustace raised an eyebrow. ""And who is your source for these accusations? The man currently evading the police? His testimony will surely not hold up in court."" She smirked. ""We have corroborating evidence. Someone else knew of Nadina's meeting with you at the Mill House."" Sir Eustace's expression shifted, betraying his surprise.",1
"""To shoot himself in the manner described, he would have had to manipulate the trigger with his toe, or so I assume. If Maltravers was discovered with one boot removed, surely someone would have mentioned it. A peculiar detail like that would have stood out. ""No, I must admit, I am leaning towards the belief that this was a homicide, not a suicide. However, I acknowledge that I lack any concrete evidence to support my hypothesis. Thus, the intricate charade you witnessed tonight."" ""Even now, I am not entirely clear on all the specifics of the incident,"" I remarked. ""Let us go back to the very start.""",1
"""Would you dare to ask me that question once more, mademoiselle?"" ""What are you implying?"" ""If the question were posed again, my response would differ. Someone is under suspicion, but they are not Chilean."" ""Who?"" The question slipped quietly through her lips. ""Jack Renauld."" ""What?"" She exclaimed. ""Jack? That's impossible. Who would even dare to suspect him?"" ""Giraud."" ""Giraud!"" Her face turned pale. ""I fear that man. He is ruthless. He will he will "" She hesitated. But then a sense of bravery and resolve overtook her. In that moment, I recognized her as a fighter. Poirot, too, observed her closely.",1
"In the hallway, Giraud faced Poirot, announcing the arrest of Jack Renauld for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld. Poirot, stunned by Jack's lack of defense, followed Giraud into the salon for an explanation. Giraud outlined his case, pointing to Jack's motive and means, confident in his detective work. However, Poirot cleverly pointed out a flaw in Giraud's reasoning, leaving him speechless. As Poirot left, he mentioned the overlooked lead piping, adding another layer to the mystery. Mrs. Renauld's entrance only deepened the intrigue, as Jack stood in silence, his fate hanging in the balance.",1
"Poirot glanced at me with a raised eyebrow. ""Here we go!"" he whispered. ""You've already spotted a goddess!"" ""But, come on, wasn't she?"" I pressed. ""Possibly. I didn't take notice,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""You must have seen her?"" I insisted. ""My friend, two people hardly ever perceive the same thing. You, for example, saw a goddess. I,"" he paused. ""Yes?"" ""I only saw a girl with worried eyes,"" Poirot stated seriously. Just then, we arrived at a large green gate, and both of us gasped in unison. Standing before it was an imposing police officer. He signaled us to stop. ""You can't go through, gentlemen.",1
"Poirot was engrossed in reading his letters when suddenly his attention shifted. A letter from a mysterious Mr. Renauld in France, urgently requesting his detective services, caught his eye. Poirot's interest was piqued, and he wasted no time in deciding to embark on this new adventure. The urgency of the situation was clear, and they needed to act swiftly. The mention of Santiago and South America added a layer of intrigue to the case. The clock was ticking, and there was no time to waste. A sense of excitement filled the air as Poirot and his companion prepared to embark on their journey to France.",1
"""They were missing when I returned from dinner."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Absolutely. I debated whether or not to wear them, but ultimately chose the emeralds and returned them to the jewel case."" ""Who had the key to the jewel case?"" ""I did. I always keep the key on a chain around my neck."" She displayed it as she spoke. The detective inspected it and raised an eyebrow. ""The thief likely had a copy of the key. Not a difficult task. The lock is rather basic. What was your next move after locking the jewel case?"" ""I placed it back in the usual bottom drawer."" ""You didn't lock the drawer?"" ""No, I never do.""",1
"I am alone and desperate, begging for Jack's salvation. Marthe Daubreuil pleaded with me to help. We rushed to Villa Marguerite immediately, where Marthe awaited us, clinging to Poirot. She was tormented, unable to see Jack in prison. Poirot reassured her, suggesting Jack may be protecting someone. Marthe suspected Jack's mother, accusing her of foul play. Poirot questioned Marthe about her mother's true identity and revealed shocking truths about M. Renauld. Overwhelmed, Marthe begged Poirot to save the man she loved. The next morning, we witnessed Jack's deteriorating state during his examination.",1
"In an instant, I brandished the gun concealed in my boot and pressed it against his temple. The pair of bodyguards by Harry’s side lunged forward, only to be halted by his commanding voice. “One more move and it’s over! Anne, pull the trigger if they dare to advance.” “I won’t hesitate,” I responded with a grin. “Actually, I’m quite nervous about using it.” I could tell that Sir Eustace shared my apprehension, as he trembled like a leaf. “Remain in your places,” he instructed, and the guards froze in their tracks. “Order them out of the room,” Harry demanded. Sir Eustace complied without hesitation.",1
"""It's hard for you to believe, my friend, that a man would orchestrate his own demise? Instead of accepting this truth, you choose to believe a story that is even more far-fetched. Yes, Mr. Renauld did plan his own death, but there's a crucial detail you may have overlooked - he didn't plan to actually die."" I shook my head, feeling confused. ""But no, it's quite simple really,"" Poirot explained kindly. ""For Mr. Renauld's plan, a murderer wasn't needed, as I mentioned before, but a body was. Let's reconsider, this time from a different perspective."" Georges Conneau flees to Canada to avoid capture.""",1
"""The revolver at Ealing was a mistake, a clue that led me on the right track. The criminals wanted the police far from Derbyshire, so they planted it there. It wasn't the one used to shoot Mr. Pace, which Mrs. Havering did slyly. Despite Japp's efforts, they escaped justice. But fate caught up with them later. Bond robberies were on the rise, including the disappearance of a million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds on the Olympia. Miss Farquhar sought Poirot's help, as her fiancé was blamed for the theft. The bonds were entrusted to him by his uncle, Mr. Vavasour, and disappeared during the voyage.""",1
"As the night drew to a close, I managed to convince her to let me walk her to the edge of town. We retraced our path, passing by the cemetery once more before veering off onto a different road. When we reached the first row of shops, she paused and extended her hand. ""Thank you for coming with me,"" she said. ""Are you sure you'll be alright now?"" I inquired. ""Yes, I'll be fine. I hope you won't face any repercussions for showing me around,"" she replied. I assured her that it was not a concern. ""Well then, goodbye."" ""Au revoir,"" I interjected. ""If you're sticking around, we'll cross paths once more.""",1
"""Comme ça! A magnificent stone without a flaw,"" he exclaimed as he examined the jewel closely. ""You will leave it with me, n’est-ce pas?"" Miss Marvell explained her plan to visit Yardly Chase with the diamond, despite Poirot's suggestion against it. The conversation turned to the famous Star of the East diamond in the Yardly collection, sparking Poirot's interest. Suddenly, Gregory Rolf, a dashing actor, entered the room, discussing the upcoming trip. Poirot advised against taking the diamond, causing tension between Mary and her husband. Despite Mary's protests, Poirot stood firm in his decision.",1
"“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, shaking his head in a dismissive manner. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, standing up, “all this is very intriguing, but I must take my leave.” “One moment, my dear Pedler, one moment, I implore you. Now, tell me, in confidence, do you not plan on traveling to South Africa soon yourself? You have significant investments in Rhodesia, I understand, and the issue of Rhodesia joining the Union is one that greatly concerns you.”",1
"As I turned the corner, I realized that despite having Cinderella's address, I was still clueless about her name. Inside the Salon, the examining magistrate was deep in conversation with the elderly gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary acknowledged my presence with a smile and a nod. Taking a seat discreetly, I observed M. Hautet's thorough and detailed questioning, yet he failed to uncover any significant information. Auguste confessed that the gardening gloves were his own, explaining that he used them when tending to a specific type of primula plant that was toxic to certain individuals.",1
"As Pagett made sure to wait until he had eliminated any suspicious activities, I decided to board a tram out of the city and take a leisurely stroll in the countryside. The weather was pleasantly cool, providing a welcome relief after my confined travels and time spent at Muizenberg. It's funny how seemingly insignificant details can have a big impact - like when my shoelace suddenly came undone, causing me to stop and bend down to tie it. Just as I was fixing my shoe, a man turned the corner and nearly collided with me. He quickly tipped his hat, offered a brief apology, and continued on his way.",1
"Poirot reappeared at Dover looking brisk and smiling, making our journey to London uneventful. It was well past nine o’clock by the time we arrived, and I assumed we would head straight to our rooms and wait until morning. However, Poirot had different ideas. “We must act quickly, mon ami. The news of the arrest won’t hit the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still time is of the essence.” I didn’t fully grasp his logic, but I inquired about his plan to locate the missing girl. “Do you recall Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? Well, I once helped him with a Japanese wrestler.”",1
"The man identified as L. B. Carton from Kimberley, South Africa had arrived at the hotel the day before and booked a room. He seemed to have come straight off the steamer. I was the only witness to the incident. The coroner questioned me, asking if I thought it was an accident. I was certain it was. The man appeared to have been startled by something, causing him to step back unintentionally. When asked what could have alarmed him, I couldn't say for sure. But he did seem terrified, almost panicked. One juryman casually suggested that the man may have been scared of cats, possibly having seen one.",1
"""Poirot hesitated before speaking, his voice barely a whisper: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is as follows: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, straight nose, no distinctive marks.” “Could it be Mrs. Robinson?” I interjected. “It's a possibility,” Poirot conceded. “Furthermore, there was a report of a dark-skinned man, possibly a foreigner, asking about the residents of No. 4 just this morning. Therefore, my friend, I suggest we abandon our sleep tonight and keep watch in the apartment below with your trusty revolver, of course!” “Count me in,” I responded eagerly.""",1
"""Poirot, I believe you were the last person to see the dagger. Is that correct?"" Inspector Giraud's piercing eyes bore into Poirot's. ""Oui, it is true,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""But I did not touch it, I did not take it."" ""Then who did?"" Giraud pressed, his tone accusatory. Poirot's gaze remained steady. ""That, my friend, is the question, is it not?"" The room fell into a tense silence as everyone pondered the implications of the missing dagger. It was a crucial piece of evidence, now vanished into thin air. The investigation had just taken a sharp turn, and the truth seemed more elusive than ever.",1
"”She gasped when she noticed the blood-stained tip, her eyes widening in terror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, it is, madame. Your husband met his end at the hands of this very weapon.” Quickly, he concealed it from view. “Are you certain this is the same one that sat on your dressing-table last night?” “Absolutely. It was a gift from my son, who served in the Air Force during the War. He pretended to be older than he was.” Her voice held a hint of pride. “This was crafted from a streamlined aeroplane wire, a memento from my son's time in the War.” “I understand, madame. Which leads us to another issue.",1
"""The Prime Minister, accompanied by Captain Daniels, was granted an Audience at Windsor. On the way back to town, an attempted assassination took place. Captain Daniels, a linguist who speaks seven languages, is under scrutiny. The Premier's car was held up by masked men, but the Prime Minister escaped with a slight wound. After a brief stop at a local hospital, he proceeded to Charing Cross. The car, found outside a German agent meeting place, was missing the chauffeur. Two disappearances: the Prime Minister in France, and the chauffeur in London. Poirot is granted carte blanche to investigate.""",1
"And what choice did I have? None. In just fifteen minutes, I would be departing from the station, leaving Pagett behind as he waved goodbye. He had managed to outmaneuver me skillfully. Furthermore, his attitude towards me had shifted. It was filled with a forced friendliness that didn't suit him, making my stomach turn. This man was a deceitful hypocrite. After attempting to kill me, he now showered me with flattery! Did he really think I didn't recognize him that fateful night on the boat? No, it was all an act, one that he expected me to go along with, all the while hiding his true intentions.",1
"As we prepared to call it a night, Sir Guy suddenly grasped Poirot's arm and pointed ahead. Among the tents, a mysterious figure was seen moving in the shadows. It bore a resemblance to the dog-headed entity I had previously observed in the tomb engravings. A chill ran down my spine at the eerie sight. ""Mon Dieu!"" Poirot uttered, making the sign of the cross fervently. ""Anubis, the jackal-headed deity of the afterlife."" Dr. Tosswill abruptly stood up, declaring, ""Someone is playing a prank on us."" Sir Guy, visibly shaken, whispered, ""It entered your tent, Harper,"" his complexion drained of color.",1
"I trailed behind him, silently mimicking the Barotsi woman I had once observed near the Falls. Unlike her, I wasn't balancing a frying-pan on my head. His pace was so brisk, it proved challenging to keep pace. ""Harry,"" I finally spoke up, my voice meek, ""are we trekking all the way to Rhodesia?"" Abruptly, he turned, bursting into laughter as he swept me off my feet. ""I'm crazy, my love, I admit it. But I adore you so much."" ""We're both insane. And, Harry, you never asked, but I'm not sacrificing anything! I wanted this journey!"" That was a couple of years back. We're still residing on the island.",1
"""As he gazed at the lifeless body once more, it became evident that the dagger's handle was devoid of any fingerprints, indicating that the culprit had once again donned gloves. The notion struck me, 'Could it be the same killer in both instances?' Giraud's expression remained unreadable. 'Let's focus on the facts. Marchaud!' The sergeant de ville promptly entered the room. 'Yes, Monsieur?' 'Where is Madame Renauld? I summoned her fifteen minutes ago.' 'She and her son are approaching the house, Monsieur.' 'Excellent. I will interrogate them separately.' With a salute, Marchaud exited the room.""",1
"""Given the circumstances, I decided to postpone my trip. But when I read the distressing news in the newspaper, I rushed to offer my assistance. Perhaps you could use some help in managing things for a while."" Just then, they noticed our presence. Poirot took a step forward and, after apologizing profusely, mentioned that he had left his cane in the hallway. Somewhat reluctantly, it appeared to me, Mrs. Maltravers performed the necessary introductions. ""Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black."" A brief conversation followed, during which Poirot discovered that Captain Black was staying at the Anchor Inn.",1
"""It appeared she was unable to tear her gaze away from Race. She approached me this evening, hesitatingly mentioning a favor she wished to request. Could I manage her keepsakes on her behalf? ""Not the creatures?"" I exclaimed, filled with sudden dread. I had always feared being burdened with those dreadful animals eventually. After some negotiation, we reached an agreement. I agreed to safeguard two delicate items in small wooden boxes for her. The animals will be carefully packed by the nearby shop into large crates and shipped to Cape Town by train, where Pagett will arrange for their storage.""",1
"""Poirot, what is your theory?” “One, Mr. Davenheim's sudden obsession with collecting rare coins. Two, his mysterious journey to Rio de Janeiro last year.” “Surely, you jest!” “I assure you, I am deadly serious. Oh, dear, I do hope Japp has not overlooked my request.” To Poirot's surprise, Japp had not forgotten, as a telegram arrived promptly the following day. Upon reading it aloud, the message stated: “‘Couple have not been seen together since last Christmas.’” “Ah-ha!” exclaimed Poirot. “And now it is mid-July! The pieces of the puzzle are falling into place!” I gazed at him in astonishment.",1
"""The possession of Cabin 17 seems to be a matter of contention,"" I remarked casually. Pagett, with a look of concern, proceeded to reveal a mysterious encounter involving Mr. Chichester and Miss Beddingfeld. Despite my attempts to downplay the situation, Pagett persisted in his suspicions, insinuating foul play. His paranoia extended to the presence of Colonel Race, a Secret Service agent on board. As Pagett spun his tales of intrigue and danger, I couldn't help but find amusement in his dramatic nature. It was clear that the journey ahead was bound to be filled with unexpected twists and turns.",1
"""The typewriter is in excellent condition."" ""What about all the cases?"" ""Even the two small ones."" ""I'd prefer if you weren't so nosy, Pagett. Those small cases are none of your concern. They belong to Mrs. Blair."" Pagett's expression fell. He despised making errors. ""Just repack them neatly,"" I instructed. ""Then take a stroll outside. Jo'burg might be a pile of rubble tomorrow, so enjoy it while you can."" I hoped that would keep him occupied for the morning, at least. ""There's something I need to discuss with you when you have time, Sir Eustace."" ""I'm busy at the moment,"" I interjected quickly.",1
"At the same time, if news of my getaway reached Chichester, along with the fact that I had departed Cape Town for Durban, it would be easy for him to disembark at Port Elizabeth or East London and evade me completely. It presented quite a dilemma. ""Let's look into train schedules for Durban regardless,"" I suggested. ""And there's still time for morning tea,"" added Suzanne. ""We can enjoy it in the lounge."" The train to Durban was scheduled for departure at 8:15 that night, as confirmed by the office. I held off on making a decision for now and joined Suzanne for a rather late ""eleven-o'clock tea.""",1
"I wanted to go to the Magnificent right away to inform Miss Marvell about what had happened, however Poirot rejected the idea, saying that the next morning would be more suitable. I reluctantly agreed. The following morning, Poirot appeared hesitant to leave the house. I started to think that maybe he was reluctant to continue with the investigation after realizing his initial mistake. When I tried to persuade him, he logically pointed out that since the details of the Yardly Chase incident were already in the morning newspapers, the Rolfs would be as informed as we were. I reluctantly conceded.",1
"The bonds were last seen in the London and Scottish Bank office on the morning of the 23rd. However, they mysteriously reappeared in New York shortly after the Olympia docked, prompting speculation about their true whereabouts. One theory suggested that the bonds never actually made it onto the Olympia at all. Could they have been transported to New York by another means? Indeed, the Gigantic set sail from Southampton on the same day as the Olympia, boasting the fastest Atlantic crossing time. If the bonds were mailed on the Gigantic, they would have arrived in New York a day before the Olympia.",1
"""However, the question remained - why the sudden silence from him on such a crucial issue? It was clear that Marthe had been aware from the start, explaining her anxiety and persistent inquiries to Poirot regarding any suspects. Lost in thought, I was brought back to reality by the sound of the approaching train, and soon enough Poirot was before me. His face was aglow with excitement, his joy palpable as he embraced me warmly, disregarding my typical English reserve. 'My dear friend, I have triumphed beyond measure!' he exclaimed. 'Really? That's wonderful news,' I replied, genuinely pleased.""",1
"""May I inquire about the departure times of the final train from Merlinville station?"" questioned Poirot. ""The schedule shows eleven-fifty going one direction and 12:17 in the other, however the possibility of a waiting motor seems more feasible."" Poirot, appearing slightly disappointed, nodded in agreement. ""Indeed, that could be a valuable lead,"" remarked the magistrate optimistically. ""A motor with two foreigners would surely attract attention. Well noted, M. Bex."" With a brief smile, the magistrate turned serious once more, addressing Mrs. Renauld, ""Now, there is another matter to discuss.""",1
"""Race, please, share with us the details,"" he prompted. ""Of course, I will divulge the tale. I'm sure you are all familiar with Sir Laurence Eardsley, the prominent South African tycoon? Although his wealth stemmed from gold mines, his son is the focus of this narrative. Prior to the War, rumors circulated about a potential new Kimberley hidden in the rocky terrain of the British Guiana rainforest. According to reports, two daring explorers had recently journeyed back from that region of South America, showcasing an extraordinary assortment of uncut diamonds, including some notably large ones.""",1
"""Sacre bleu!"" Poirot exclaimed. ""That Giraud, always in a rush. I won't have time to organize this drawer properly. Let's hurry."" Hastily, he dumped the contents onto the floor, revealing mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly, Poirot's eyes lit up as he found a small square cardboard - a photograph. After pocketing it, he carelessly stuffed the items back into the drawer. Grabbing my arm, he swiftly led me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hallway, Giraud was standing, observing his suspect. ""Good day, M. Giraud,"" greeted Poirot. ""What do we have here?"" Giraud gestured towards Jack.",1
"I buried my nose in a bunch of violets and felt better. The attractive Mrs. Blair, a well-known society lady, caught my attention. She snubbed those who tried to scrape acquaintance, focusing her attention on a silent man. The next morning, Mrs. Blair led me to change cabins, but a dispute arose with Rev. Chichester and Mr. Pagett over Cabin 17. A terrible smell in my cabin turned out to be asafœtida, making me suspicious of the number 17. I decided to stay in the cabin, convinced that something would happen at one o'clock. The suspenseful night seemed endless as I waited for the unknown event.",1
"I had been stuck in that room for what felt like an eternity. The glass was my only hope of escape. It took forever, but I finally managed to saw through the cords binding my wrists. Once free, I cautiously made my way out of the room and down the staircase, where I overheard a conversation between my Dutch friend and Mr. Chichester. They were discussing something about a girl who knew too much and needed to be taken care of. I quickly retreated to the attic to avoid being caught eavesdropping. It was clear that danger lurked in that house, and I needed to find a way out before it was too late.",1
"I refrained from questioning Poirot about our destination in the presence of our captive, struggling to glean any insight into the situation. We arrived at a modest house set back from the road. A tipsy passerby staggered along the sidewalk, nearly bumping into Poirot, who uttered something sternly to him, the words escaping me. The three of us ascended the house's steps. Poirot pressed the doorbell and gestured for us to step back. Silence followed, prompting Poirot to ring the bell again before resorting to knocking loudly. A light flickered on above the door, which cautiously opened a crack.",1
"I was fixated on him. The man, named Carton, hailed from Kimberley and was a diamond-sorter under De Beers'. I ventured to Kimberley to uncover more about him, armed with my revolver. Carton confessed his involvement in a robbery scheme with Anita Grünberg, whom he revealed to be his estranged wife. He divulged that Anita had kept some stolen stones for leverage against the mysterious 'Colonel'. Carton suggested striking a deal with Anita to expose the 'Colonel' in exchange for a hefty sum. Despite Carton's shaky credibility, I pondered his proposal and returned to the hotel, waiting anxiously.",1
"""I am quite the jester at times, if I put in the effort, but rest assured I am not jesting at this moment."" ""I was under the impression that, seeing as I was quite a distance away, you had not identified me, Sir Eustace."" ""Identified me where?"" ""In Marlow, Sir Eustace?"" ""In Marlow? Why on earth were you in Marlow?"" ""I thought that was clear."" ""I am becoming more perplexed by the moment. Let's rewind. You traveled to Florence."" ""So you truly did not know and failed to recognize me!"" ""Based on what I can gather, it appears you have needlessly revealed yourself, driven by your guilty conscience.""",1
"""I was clearly inebriated when I approached Race. Clearly. Mark my words, Pagett, let your bruised eye serve as a cautionary tale, abstain from excessive drinking in the future."" ""As you are aware, I abstain from alcohol, Sir Eustace."" ""It's much wiser to commit to sobriety if you struggle with such temptations. Have I approached anyone else, Pagett?"" ""Not to my knowledge, Sir Eustace."" I breathed a sigh of relief. ""There's Miss Beddingfeld,"" I mused. ""She's eager to travel to Rhodesia for archaeological excavations, I believe. I'm considering offering her a temporary position as a secretary.""",1
"""Remember, not a single word to anyone,"" Sir Eustace paused. ""I trust your creative flair to add the finishing touches,"" he added. ""Just ensure there are no errors."" ""Simply sign it 'With eternal love, Anne,'"" I suggested. As I penned the words, Sir Eustace reached for the letter and scanned it. ""Looks good. Now, the destination."" I disclosed the address of a discreet shop known for handling mail and messages. Sir Eustace rang the bell on the table. Chichester-Pettigrew, also known as Minks, appeared promptly. ""Send this letter through the usual channels without delay,"" Sir Eustace instructed.",1
"""She feigned great interest in our discovery, and we shared all the details with her, even revealing the diamonds. Delilah, a fitting name for her deceptive ways, played her role convincingly! The De Beers heist was uncovered, and suddenly the police swooped in. They confiscated our diamonds. Initially, we found the situation laughable. However, when the diamonds were presented in court, there was no doubt - they were the stolen De Beers gems. Anita Grünberg had vanished, successfully executing the switch. Our claim that these were not the original stones fell on deaf ears, met with ridicule.""",1
"I decided to rename the car ""Colonel Race and his Entourage"" instead of ""Sir Eustace Pedler and Party."" Mrs. Blair, on the other hand, became fixated on taking absurd photos during our journey. With each treacherous turn and ascent, she insisted on capturing shots of the engine. ""Can you see the thrill?"" she exclaimed with glee. ""It's truly remarkable to photograph the front of the train from the rear, especially with the backdrop of the looming mountains."" I tried to explain that the perspective was indiscernible, but she simply smiled and replied, ""I will caption it: 'Taken from the train.'""",1
"I first encountered her in the town, a woman with a sharp sense of humor that sets her apart. Despite my enjoyment of our conversations, they are often interrupted by a long-legged, stoic individual who clings to her side like a barnacle. Colonel Race, as he is known, does not strike me as someone who truly entertains her. Handsome, yes, but about as interesting as a wet rag. He fits the mold of those strong, silent types that seem to captivate female writers and young girls alike. As we departed from Madeira, Guy Pagett emerged on deck, his voice hollow as he began discussing matters of work.",1
"I know. But there is still much to unravel in this twisted tale of deceit and danger. The truth lies in the shadows, waiting to be brought to light. And I will not rest until justice is served and the secrets are laid bare. The game is afoot, and I am ready to play my part in this deadly dance of deception and betrayal. Let the pieces fall where they may, for the truth will always prevail in the end. And I will be there to witness it all, standing tall in the face of danger and uncertainty. This is my story, and I will see it through to the very end. Let the truth be known, no matter the cost.",1
"I was vehemently against the idea of educating women. My belief was that females should focus on household chores and manual labor, rather than wasting time on academic pursuits. This viewpoint clashed with the upbringing my uncle intended for me, causing me great frustration and anger. Despite his insistence, I refused to comply. I was well aware of my intellectual capabilities and had no interest in menial tasks. Our relationship was strained by our opposing views, leading to numerous heated debates. Although we cared for each other deeply, our stubbornness was a constant source of conflict.",1
"The murderer who killed his victims by drowning them in their baths could have avoided detection if he had changed his methods. However, he stuck to what had worked before, leading to his downfall. Hercule Poirot, with his knowledge of the human mind, is determined to find the criminal behind the similar crimes. He points out the importance of the wristwatch gaining two hours after the tragedy and the absence of footprints in the flower bed, alluding to a deeper mystery. Just then, Gabriel Stonor, a well-traveled and imposing figure, enters the room, bringing a new energy to the investigation.",1
"“Detecting two gunshots fired,” he remarked, returning the weapon. “Now, madam, if I could inspect,” he delicately paused. “The maid will guide you,” she whispered, turning away. The parlourmaid led Poirot upstairs. I stayed behind with the elegant yet unfortunate woman. Unsure whether to speak, I attempted a few casual remarks to which she responded absentmindedly. After a brief moment, Poirot rejoined us. “Thank you for your cooperation, madam. I believe you need not worry further about this incident. By the way, are you familiar with your husband’s financial situation?” She shook her head.",1
"She made it clear to me that Sir Eustace lived his life with a strong focus on feeling secure and at ease. His self-preservation instinct was sharp. The death of Nadina removed some of his inhibitions. His actions were driven by his intense fears for his own safety, rather than his feelings towards me. I believe Suzanne is correct. As for Nadina, she was the type of woman who brought death upon herself. While men may resort to questionable means to become wealthy, women should not feign love for hidden agendas. I can pardon Sir Eustace quite easily, but I will never be able to forgive Nadina.",1
"""He frequently travels back and forth to Africa. It is rumored that he is involved in undercover operations, although the truth remains uncertain. He carries an air of mystery about him."" ""Perhaps he inherited a substantial fortune from Sir Laurence Eardsley?"" ""Ah, he must be quite wealthy. He would make a suitable match for you."" ""I can't pursue him while you're here,"" I joked. ""Ah, the complications of married women!"" ""We certainly have an advantage,"" Suzanne said smugly. ""Everyone knows my loyalty lies with my husband, Clarence. It's much safer and more enjoyable to court a devoted wife.""",1
"“He will likely remain unconscious for a minimum of seven days.” Denise and Françoise rushed to their mistress, and with them in charge, Poirot departed the residence. His head was bowed, brows furrowed in deep thought as he stared at the ground. I held my tongue for a while, but eventually mustered the courage to ask him a question. “Despite all the evidence pointing otherwise, do you think there’s a possibility that Jack Renauld is innocent?” Poirot stayed silent for a moment, then finally spoke with seriousness in his tone: “I cannot say for certain, Hastings. But there is a slim chance.”",1
"""Pardon me, madame, but may I inquire about the nature of the business in Buenos Ayres?” Mrs. Renauld turned to face him, her expression guarded. “I am afraid I do not possess such knowledge, Monsieur Poirot. However, Buenos Ayres is merely a stepping stone for my son, his true destination being Santiago.” The mention of Santiago seemed to trigger a reaction in both the magistrate and the commissary, who simultaneously exclaimed, “Santiago! Once again, Santiago!” Poirot, who had been lost in thought near the window, approached Mrs. Renauld with a respectful nod, his mind seemingly elsewhere.",1
"""The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. Is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds? The last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the morning of the 23rd. All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. The man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft. Ah, here we are. You permit?”",1
"“Well, there's always Sir Eustace Pedler’s property,” the man hesitated. “The Mill House, you're familiar with it.” “Not exactly where,” I stumbled. (Honestly, stumbling is becoming my forte.) “That's right! The scene of the crime. But maybe you wouldn't be interested.”“Oh, I don't believe I'd be bothered,” I responded with a show of confidence. I believed my credibility was now firmly established. “And maybe I could snag a deal under the circumstances.” A stroke of genius, in my opinion. “Well, it's a possibility. Letting it out won't be easy now with servants and all that, you understand.”",1
"Dust was scattered about conspicuously, catching my sensitive friend's attention as he traced his finger along a rectangular mark on a nearby table. ""The service here is less than satisfactory,"" he remarked wryly. Lost in thought, he gazed out of the window, lost in contemplation. ""Well?"" I pressed, my impatience growing. ""Why did we even come here?"" His response was delayed. ""Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wanted to verify if the door was truly bolted on this side as well."" ""Well,"" I replied, glancing at the door leading to the previous room, ""it is indeed bolted."" Poirot simply nodded.",1
"She was in her middle years, with hair that was once dark but now mostly silvered. Despite her age, her strong personality exuded vitality. It was clear she was a force to be reckoned with, a true ""maitresse femme."" With a dignified nod, she welcomed us. ""Please, take a seat, gentlemen."" As we sat down, the magistrate's clerk positioned himself at a nearby table. M. Hautet spoke up, ""Madame, I hope you can recount for us the events of last night without causing you undue distress?"" She replied, ""Of course not, monsieur. Time is of the essence in capturing and punishing these vile murderers.""",1
"""But, Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls, though I only found out yesterday."" ""You knew!"" I exclaimed. ""Interestingly enough, it was Pagett who spilled the beans. He droned on about a pointless story involving a bet and a tin of films. It didn't take me long to connect the dots - Mrs. Blair's suspicion of Colonel Race, her nervousness, her plea for me to look after her souvenirs. The eager Pagett had already opened the cases. So, before exiting the hotel, I discreetly moved all the film rolls into my own pocket. They're right over there in the corner.""",1
"""Rage coursed through me at the sight of the lifeless woman. I felt the urge to end her existence right then and there. But how could he have ever loved her to feel such intense emotions? I composed myself and calmly spoke, 'It seems we have nothing left to discuss. Good night.' 'Good night and farewell, Miss Beddingfeld.' 'Until we meet again, Mr. Lucas.' The mention of his name caused him to recoil. He approached me. 'Why do you say we will meet again?' 'Because I have a feeling our paths will cross once more.' 'Not if I have a say in it!' His words were forceful, but I remained unfazed.""",1
"His account matched that of Miss Farquhar in every detail. After he had finished speaking, Poirot picked up the conversation with a query. ""What specifically prompted you to realize that the bonds had been taken, Mr. Ridgeway?"" He chuckled bitterly. ""The evidence was right in front of me, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn't have overlooked it. My cabin trunk was partially pulled out from under the bunk, with visible scratches and cuts where the thieves attempted to break the lock."" ""Yet I was under the impression that it was opened with a key?"" ""Indeed. They attempted to force it, but to no avail.""",1
"Poirot studied me carefully, giving advice to stick to my words. He mentioned arranging a marriage for me, but I declined. Poirot, obsessed with neatness, asked about Mademoiselle Cinderella's whereabouts. Despite my misgivings, I followed Poirot's lead, knowing he had a keen eye for human nature. As he left for Paris, I pondered his mysterious insights. I decided to inquire about Cinderella at the Hôtel du Phare, but to my surprise, she was not there. The concierge denied her presence, hinting at Poirot's earlier visit. His description matched Poirot's, confirming his secret investigation.",1
"""But was it Daniels or O’Murphy behind it all? One of them had to be involved, considering the car veered off the main road. It seems highly unlikely that the Prime Minister would be complicit in his own demise! Did O’Murphy make that fateful turn on his own, or was Daniels the mastermind behind it all?” “It appears more likely that O’Murphy was the culprit.” “Certainly, because if it had been Daniels, the Prime Minister would have overheard the command and inquired about the motive. Yet, there seems to be an abundance of unanswered questions in this case, each one contradicting the next.""",1
"""He doesn't have much going against him, besides the mystery surrounding his background and his proficiency in numerous languages, which is unusual for an Englishman. (Excuse my bluntness, but your linguistic abilities are truly lacking!) As for the victim, he was discovered gagged, tied up, and under the influence of chloroform, indicating he may not have been involved in the crime."" Poirot dismissed the idea. ""The French authorities would not overlook such a detail. Additionally, once he achieved his goal of abducting the Prime Minister, there would be no reason for him to stick around.""",1
"""Listen to your elders without interruption. I have a proposal for you. Your life in exchange for the diamonds. Understand that your life is completely under my control."" ""And what about Harry?"" ""I am too compassionate to separate young lovers. He will be released as well, with the condition that neither of you will interfere with me in the future."" ""How can I trust that you will uphold your end of the deal?"" ""You have no guarantee, my dear. You must have faith in me and hope for the best. Unless, of course, you are feeling heroic and would prefer annihilation, which is a different story.""",1
"""One learns to value life and death with ease.” “Indeed,” I replied, recalling Harry Rayburn. He had shared that sentiment. “But one should not mistreat the vulnerable?” “There are varying opinions on what constitutes ‘vulnerability,’ Miss Anne.” His tone turned serious, catching me off guard. It dawned on me that I had little insight into the man walking beside me. “I was referring to children and animals, perhaps.” “I can assure you I’ve never been unkind to children or animals. Do you consider women as ‘vulnerable’?” I paused. “No, I don’t believe I do, although they may be, I suppose.”",1
"""You're certain of that?"" ""Yes."" ""No small disagreements, right?"" Jack simply shrugged. ""Everyone's entitled to their own opinion."" ""Of course, of course. But if someone were to claim that you had a heated argument with your father before leaving for Paris, that person would be lying, correct?"" I couldn't help but admire Giraud's cleverness. His claim that ""I know everything"" was no joke. Jack Renauld seemed uneasy at the question. ""We did argue,"" he confessed. ""Ah, an argument! And during that argument, did you say: 'When you're dead, I can do what I want'?"" ""I might have,"" Jack muttered.",1
"Poirot analyzed the situation carefully. ""They did not leave through the door. They left by the window,"" he declared. His statement left me puzzled, trying to understand the implications of such a revelation. The open door now seemed like a distraction, a red herring to divert attention from the real method of exit. The window provided a much more discreet and efficient way for the perpetrators to leave the scene undetected. This new perspective shed light on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr. Renauld's death and opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for our investigation.",1
"“But I need more information to fully understand the situation. So, let's start from the beginning. You mentioned going to Florence.” “Actually, I never went to Florence. That's the truth of it.” “Then where did you go?” “I went back home to Marlow.” “Why on earth would you go back to Marlow?” “To check on my wife. She was unwell and expecting” “Your wife? I had no idea you were married.” “Yes, Sir Eustace, that's the truth. I kept that from you.” “How long have you been married?” “Just a little over eight years. I was married for only six months when I started working as your secretary.”",1
"""It's probably quite pleasant for Clarence to have you as his spouse."" ""I'm quite a handful to live with! But he can always retreat to the Foreign Office, where he adjusts his monocle, settles into a large armchair, and dozes off. Perhaps we should telegram him and inquire about Race. I do enjoy sending telegrams. They tend to vex Clarence. He always insists a letter would suffice. I doubt he would divulge much, though. He is incredibly discreet. It's precisely this quality that makes cohabitation with him unbearable for extended periods. Nonetheless, let's continue with our matchmaking.""",1
"""Well,” I asked eagerly, “what are your thoughts on this, Mrs. Blair?” “I find it absolutely enthralling! First things first, please stop with the Mrs. Blair. Suzanne is much more preferable. Agreed?” “I would be delighted, Suzanne.” “Excellent. Now, let’s focus on the task at hand. You mentioned that in Sir Eustace’s secretary, not the somber Pagett, but the other one, you recognized the man who was stabbed and sought refuge in your cabin?” I confirmed. “This connects Sir Eustace to the web in two ways. The woman was killed in his residence, and his secretary was attacked at one o’clock.",1
"“You slept well, correct? Have you recovered from the dreadful crossing? You appear almost normal this morning. Excuse me, but your tie is askew. Allow me to fix it for you.” I have previously introduced Hercule Poirot. A remarkable individual! Standing at five feet four inches tall, with an egg-shaped head tilted slightly to one side, eyes that gleamed green in excitement, a stiff military moustache, and a profound air of dignity! He was always impeccably dressed. Neatness was his absolute obsession. Any hint of disorder or dirt was unbearable to him until he could rectify the situation.",1
"He restrains and silences Madame Renauld, rectifying his error from two decades earlier, ensuring the tightness of the restraints this time to avoid implicating his partner. Despite this, he ensures she is equipped with the identical tale he fabricated previously, illustrating the mind's aversion to deviation. The evening air is cold, prompting him to don an additional coat over his garments, planning to discard it alongside the deceased in the burial site. Exiting through the window, he meticulously smooths the soil in the garden, inadvertently providing damning proof of his involvement.",1
"Her chest rose and fell with each breath, her eyes widening in disbelief. ""You're involved in this?"" I simply nodded, knowing I had hit the mark. The intensity of her emotions was clear as day. A brief silence followed, her gaze fixed on me. Then, with a firm nod, she spoke. ""Well, paint me surprised! Show me everything. I want to witness the darkness."" ""What do you mean?"" I inquired. ""Exactly what I said. Believe me, I have a fascination for crimes. Why else would I risk my feet in these high heels, trudging through this mess?"" Hours had been spent scouring the area, searching for clues.",1
"Poirot's brow furrowed in confusion, causing me to lean in and ask softly, ""What's wrong?"" He dismissed my question with a shake of his head and inquired, ""Excuse me, M. Bex, but could M. Renauld have driven the car himself?"" The commissary glanced at Françoise, who quickly responded, ""No, Monsieur did not drive himself."" Poirot's expression darkened. ""I wish you would share your concerns with me,"" I urged. ""Don't you see? In his letter, M. Renauld mentioned sending the car for me in Calais."" ""Maybe he meant a rental car,"" I proposed. ""Probably, but why rent a car when you have your own?""",1
"” “At fancy Italian resorts?” “Inexpensive if you know where to look.” I studied her closely. “But you weren’t planning on being here when we first crossed paths, were you?” “We all face setbacks,” Miss Cinderella remarked wisely. “Now, I’ve shared enough. Curiosity isn’t a good trait for young boys. So, why are you here? Tagging along with the M.P., I presume, playing the carefree youth on the shore.” I disagreed. “Think again. Remember when I mentioned my close friend is a detective?” “Yes?” “And I’m sure you’re familiar with the recent incident at the Chateau Belle?” She gazed at me.'",1
"""His plan, from what I gathered, involved assigning her enough tasks to keep her glued to her desk in her designated area all day long."" I chuckled. Later, along with the other two, I located Sir Eustace. He paced back and forth in the confined area, bombarding the hapless secretary, who I noticed for the first time. A tall, angular woman in plain attire, sporting spectacles and a businesslike demeanor. It seemed she struggled to keep up with Sir Eustace, as her pencil raced across the paper, her brow furrowed in concentration. I entered the compartment. ""Welcome aboard, sir,"" I quipped.",1
"""I stood outside waiting, but they never emerged. Eventually, I ventured inside. Sir Eustace, the shop was deserted! There must be an alternate exit,"" I informed him. ""Upon my return to the hotel, I inquired about Miss Pettigrew."" Pagett leaned in, his voice hushed and breath heavy with the weight of confidentiality. ""Sir Eustace, a witness saw a man exiting her room last night."" Arching my eyebrows, I commented, ""And I had always believed her to be a woman of impeccable reputation."" Ignoring my remark, Pagett continued, ""I proceeded directly to her room and conducted a thorough search.""",1
"As I gazed into the distance, I spotted her. ""Psst, mademoiselle! Psst! Just a moment, if you please."" Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly taken aback, hurried over to the hedge at his beckoning. ""May I have a quick chat with you, mademoiselle?"" ""Of course, Monsieur Poirot."" Despite her agreement, her eyes betrayed a sense of unease. ""Do you recall chasing after me on the road when I visited your home with the examining magistrate? You inquired about any suspects in the crime."" ""And you mentioned two Chileans."" Her voice quivered slightly, and her hand instinctively reached for her chest.",1
"I followed him willingly as we approached the Mansions, a stately group of buildings meticulously maintained. A porter, adorned in uniform, was basking in the sunlight at the entrance. Poirot inquired of him: ""Excuse me, do Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?"" The porter, a curt man with a hint of suspicion, barely glanced in our direction and replied gruffly: ""No. 4. Second floor."" ""Thank you. And may I ask how long they have been living here?"" ""Six months."" Shocked, I took a step forward, only to be met with Poirot's sly smile. ""That can't be right,"" I protested. ""You must be mistaken.""",1
"I glanced at the paper in my hand, the key to the mystery. The numbers and words held a secret waiting to be unraveled. Kilmorden Castle, a place shrouded in intrigue and possibilities. A buried treasure, a missing heir, a claimant to a title. The numbers, a cryptic message or a mere diversion? I needed to get to the bottom of this, to explore every avenue until the truth revealed itself. The journey ahead was fraught with obstacles, but I was determined to see it through to the end. The pieces of the puzzle were scattered, waiting for me to put them together and reveal the hidden truth.",1
"""I would never consider marrying someone unless I was completely in love with them. Women often find joy in doing things they dislike for the one they love. The more stubborn she is, the more satisfaction she finds."" ""I have to disagree with you on that. Usually, it's the other way around,"" he said with a hint of disdain. ""That's exactly it!"" I exclaimed excitedly. ""That's why so many marriages end in unhappiness. It's all the men's fault. They either give in to their wives and end up being despised, or they are selfish, always insisting on their own way without ever showing gratitude.""",1
"""Obviously,” Giraud began, “I quickly uncovered the true nature of that Chilian deception. Two individuals were involved, but they were not enigmatic foreigners! It was all a smokescreen.” “Impressive work so far, my dear Giraud,” Poirot murmured. “Especially after their clever ploy with the match and cigarette butt.” Giraud glared, then continued: “Someone must have been implicated in the crime to have dug the grave. No one actually gains from the crime, but someone believed they would. I learned of Jack Renauld’s dispute with his father, and the threats he made. The motive was clear.”",1
"A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. If only I could find a way to save them both.",1
"Mr. MacAdam was completely unaware of these precautions. Being a fearless man himself, he would likely remove them without a second thought. However, the police had already made their own arrangements. Interestingly, the Premier's chauffeur, O'Murphy, was actually a member of the C.I.D.""""O'Murphy? That sounds like an Irish name, doesn't it?""""Yes, he's indeed Irish.""""Which part of Ireland is he from?""""County Clare, if I'm not mistaken.""""Well, carry on, my lord.""""The Premier departed for London in a closed car, accompanied by Captain Daniels. The second car followed behind, as per usual.""",1
"On the flip side, she made it clear that, while she wouldn't disclose any information, these tales were based on truth. To close confidantes, she divulged even more, discussing political plots, confidential documents, and hidden threats. Rumors circulated about the covert sale of Crown jewels, in which she played a crucial role. One of the Beroldys' social circle, a promising lawyer named Georges Conneau, quickly fell under the spell of the captivating Jeanne. Madame Beroldy subtly encouraged the infatuated young man, all the while professing her unwavering loyalty to her older husband.",1
"Poirot, Bex, and Giraud were gathered in the room, discussing the disappearance of a dagger from the glass jar. Hastings then admitted his grave fault of showing a young lady the body, leaving the door unlocked for twenty minutes. The commissary found it deplorable, but Giraud surprisingly called it admirable, suggesting that the assassin or an accomplice had been near the Villa recently. Poirot noted that the assassin wore gloves, ensuring no fingerprints were left on the dagger. The magistrate's clerk began gathering the papers as M. Hautet announced the end of their work in the room.",1
"""But before we proceed, we require some information. Please ring the bell,"" I requested. Upon doing so, Poirot paced back and forth while we waited for a response, his keen eyes taking in the orderly surroundings. ""Mr. Marsh is a man of great method. Note the meticulous organization of the papers and the ivory labels on each drawer and cabinet key. Even the china cabinet is impeccably arranged. It is truly a sight to behold, nothing out of place,"" he remarked. Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a dirty envelope attached to the key of the desk, bringing his movements to a sudden halt.",1
"""Harry smirked. “We’re in a sticky situation, darling. Concerned?” “Not when I’m with you.” “Ah, but going out in a blaze of glory isn’t ideal. We can do better than that. Looks like they’re splitting into two groups this time. Landing in different spots. Now for my little dramatic touch.” Just then, a bright flame erupted from the cabin. Its glow revealed two mysterious figures huddled on the rooftop. “Using my worn-out clothes stuffed with rags as decoys. They won’t catch on right away. Come on, Anne, we must resort to extreme measures.” Holding hands, we sprinted across the island.""",1
"""Sentiment means everything to a woman, does it not? But a man like you, who lacks such delicate sensibilities, may find some small comfort in that fact."" ""Of course, of course,"" Mr. Opalsen replied, somewhat uncertainly. ""Still..."" His words were cut off by a triumphant shout from the inspector. He entered the room, holding something between his fingers. Mrs. Opalsen sprang up from her seat with a cry. She looked like a different person. ""Oh, my necklace!"" she exclaimed, holding it tightly to her chest. We all gathered around her. ""Where was it?"" Opalsen demanded. ""In the maid's bed.""",1
"""Should we succeed, our fortunes will be made!” “Don't count your chickens before they hatch, my friend. Wealthy individuals are not quick to part with their money. I once witnessed a well-known millionaire emptying a tram full of people in search of a dropped halfpenny.” I agreed with the sentiment. “Regardless,” Poirot continued, “money is not what draws me in. While having unlimited resources for our investigation will be enjoyable and efficient, there is something peculiar about this case that piques my curiosity. Did you notice the postscript? What were your thoughts?” I pondered.",1
"As universally agreed, they conversed in English, revealing the Count's true origins now that his facade had faded away. It was known that he had once thrived as a quick-change performer in London's music halls. ""You excelled tonight,"" he acknowledged. ""My compliments to you."" ""Nevertheless,"" the woman confessed, ""I am uneasy. My status is precarious. The doubts sown during the War persist. I am under constant surveillance."" ""Yet you were never formally accused of espionage?"" ""Our leader is too meticulous for that."" ""Here's to the 'Colonel,'"" the Count toasted, with a grin on his face.",1
"Mr. Lowen expressed his apologies and bid farewell. ""Everyone is aware that Mr. Davenheim never came back. The police were notified early Sunday morning, but were baffled by the situation. Mr. Davenheim appeared to have disappeared without a trace. He had not visited the post office, nor had he been spotted in the village. Authorities confirmed he had not left by train. His personal vehicle remained in the garage. If he had arranged for a car to meet him in a remote location, it is likely that the driver would have come forward by now, given the substantial reward for any information.""",1
"On the pretense of fetching her employer, she rushes upstairs, dons a colorful sweater and a cap adorned with black ringlets which she forcefully pulls over the gray wig. A couple of skillful adjustments, and the makeup is erased, a hint of blush applied, and the captivating Zoe Havering descends with her melodious voice. No one pays much attention to the maid. Why would they? There is no evidence linking her to the crime. She, too, has an alibi.” “But the gun discovered in Ealing? Mrs. Havering couldn't have left it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s doing but they made a blunder.",1
"""But at what point did their 'strategy' falter?"" ""My friend, the idea of posing as a maid or butler is sound, but one must not neglect their duties. They overlooked a room in need of dusting; hence, when the man placed the jewel-case on the small table by the connecting door, it left a distinct mark."" ""I recall that moment,"" I exclaimed. ""Everything became clear."" A brief pause followed. ""And I have my pearls,"" Mrs. Opalsen added, like a chorus in a play. ""Well then,"" I remarked, ""it's time for dinner."" Poirot walked beside me. ""This success should boost your reputation,"" I commented.",1
"""Yes,"" I exclaimed, ""but who is the victim?"" ""I know not. A stranger. They discovered him in the shed just a short distance from poor Monsieur's body. And there's more. He was stabbed, stabbed in the heart with the very same dagger!"" Without hesitation, I sprinted up the path to the shed. The two guards stepped aside to allow me through, and with anticipation coursing through me, I stepped inside. The light was dim, the structure was a simple wooden shelter for storing old pots and tools. Although I had rushed in, I paused at the threshold, captivated by the scene unfolding before me.",1
"But Pagett was already on the warpath. He insisted on recounting a tedious tale involving a roll of films and a reckless bet placed on the Kilmorden. The incident, which took place late at night, saw a steward foolishly tossing the films through a porthole. Disliking such pranks, I expressed my disapproval to Pagett, only to have him repeat the story in his usual inept manner. It took me a while to piece together the jumbled narrative. Our paths did not cross again until lunch, when he burst in with an air of excitement reminiscent of a bloodhound. Bloodhounds were never to my liking.",1
"I always associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong, that is a lava-lava. All these things are very cheering after England. It would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of bacon-bacon and then go out clad in a jumper-jumper. Suzanne seemed calmer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a beautiful view over Table Bay. I gazed at the view while Suzanne searched for some special face cream. Once she found it and began applying it, she was able to listen to me.",1
"I was taken aback when he unexpectedly revealed that Ascanio himself would be visiting him at eleven o’clock. “He’s coming to consult you?” I asked. “Not at all, Hastings. I wish to consult him,” was his surprising response. “Regarding what?” I inquired. “The Regent’s Court murder.” “Are you planning to prove his guilt?” I asked. “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Use your common sense. Ah, here he is now,” he said as the doorbell rang. Shortly after, Signor Ascanio arrived - a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive gaze, casting suspicious looks around the room.",1
"Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings were announced by the butler, entering to find Lady Yardly and her two children in a picturesque scene. Lady Yardly, with her dark head proudly bent over her fair children, looked up in surprise as her husband sought guidance from Poirot. The detective quickly explained his presence, apologizing for his ongoing investigation into Miss Marvell's affair. Checking on the security of the premises before Miss Marvell's arrival on Friday was his primary objective. Lord Yardly stood nearby, smiling down on his family, as the butler made the introductions.",1
"Poirot was the one to reveal the shocking truth to Jack Renauld about his father's past as a fugitive from justice. After learning the truth, Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and his secretary Stonor. Jack struggled with the idea of asking the girl who loved him to join him, but Poirot encouraged him to be honest and see what she would say. In the end, Jack found the courage to approach her as a man ready for a new beginning. As for Captain Hastings, he preferred to reminisce about a morning in the garden rather than join the Renaulds on their journey.",1
"Three deaths linger as a dark omen over the unfolding events in Egypt. Lady Willard expresses her deep fear for her son, who is determined to continue his father's work amidst the lurking shadows of the past. Poirot, surprisingly superstitious, vows to protect the young man from any unseen harm. The mysterious deaths of Mr. Bleibner and Mr. Schneider raise suspicions of foul play, leading Poirot and Hastings to embark on a journey to uncover the truth. As they delve deeper into the secrets of the expedition, they encounter a web of deceit and danger that threatens to consume them all.",1
"""I'll challenge you to a game of quoits tomorrow,"" he declared. I remained silent. ""Do you think you'll never bounce back? I've seen others in worse shape than you, and within two days they were the life of the party. You'll see."" I wasn't in the mood to flat out call him a liar. I tried to convey it through a look. After a few more minutes of pleasant conversation, he thankfully left. Couples walked by, children played, and young people laughed. A few other pale patients, like myself, reclined in deck chairs. The air was refreshing, cool but not too cold, and the sun shone brightly.",1
"""It’s largely thanks to him and his generous donations that this project is progressing. He even influenced the design of it."" Poirot nodded in contemplation. Then he stated, ""The location chosen to bury the body was not ideal, was it? If the men had started digging, everything would have been uncovered."" ""Precisely,"" Giraud exclaimed in triumph. ""That indicates they were unfamiliar with the area. It's a strong form of circumstantial evidence."" ""Indeed,"" Poirot responded with uncertainty. ""No one familiar with the area would bury a body there unless they intended for it to be found.""",1
"I could tell right away that Jack Renauld was determined to handle his own case on his own terms, much to the frustration of his lawyer. The judge suddenly turned and ordered, ""Bring in the station witnesses."" Shortly after, a man entered who I identified as a porter from Merlinville station. ""Were you working on the night of June 7th?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Did you see the 11:40 train arrive?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Look at the defendant. Do you recognize him as one of the passengers who got off the train?"" ""Yes, Your Honor."" ""Are you absolutely sure?"" ""Yes, sir. I was familiar with Mr. Jack Renauld.""",1
"Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well it sounds snobbish perhaps but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class.""",1
"""Ah, we have it! 'Yardly, 10th viscount, fought in South African War' none of that matters 'married in 1907 to Hon.

""What?"" ""Yes. I sent a telegram to him."" ""I thought you were done with the case?"" ""I no longer represent Miss Marvell since she won't follow my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction and the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Clearly, I need to be involved in this matter.""",1
"""And had kept a close eye on her, especially when she was cleaning Madame’s room! Let those bumbling policemen search her, but they won’t find Madame’s pearls. Célestine spoke rapidly in French, punctuating her words with animated gestures, and the chambermaid understood her message. She flushed with anger. “That woman is accusing me of stealing the pearls, but it’s not true!” she protested vehemently. “I never even laid eyes on them.” “Go ahead, search her!” the woman shrieked. “You’ll see that I’m right.” “You’re a liar!” the chambermaid retorted, moving towards her aggressively.""",1
"“Detective Poirot addressed the group with a list of seemingly random words: ‘Name,’ ‘Place,’ ‘Tuesday,’ ‘Dinner,’ ‘Journey,’ ‘Country,’ ‘Story,’ ‘Rook Rifle,’ ‘Shot,’ ‘Suicide,’ ‘Money.’ The room fell silent as Poirot’s gaze settled on each person in turn. ‘Thank you all for your cooperation,’ he said, dismissing them with a wave of his hand. Later, as the suspects filed out, Poirot turned to me with a knowing smile. ‘Do you see it now, Hastings?’ he asked. I was at a loss. ‘I’m afraid not,’ I admitted. ‘Allow me to enlighten you,’ Poirot replied, leaning in to share his insights.”",1
"""Did Renauld confide in you at all?""""Why would you assume he would confide in me?"" ""Because, madame,"" M. Hautet said with a hint of cruelty. ""A man often tells his mistress what he hides from his wife.""""How dare you!"" she exclaimed, moving closer with anger in her eyes. ""Sir, you offend me! I have nothing to say. Please leave my residence!""The lady clearly had the upper hand. We departed Villa Marguerite feeling like chastised schoolboys. The magistrate muttered to himself in frustration. Poirot appeared deep in thought. Abruptly, he snapped out of his contemplation and turned to M.",1
"As he dictated to Miss Pettigrew, her voice droned on monotonously. ""I therefore suggest that in addressing this issue of colored labor,"" she repeated. After a pause, he grunted something angrily. I quietly moved forward. Colonel Race's room appeared vacant, and he was nowhere to be seen in the lounge. He was the one I dreaded encountering the most. Nevertheless, I had no time to spare. Hurriedly, I exited the hotel and headed towards the bridge. Crossing it, I positioned myself in the shadows, ready and watchful. If someone followed me, I would spot them as they crossed the bridge.",1
"I had my doubts about Mrs. Blair and Anne's obsession with buying wooden animals at every station. The journey through Bechuanaland was filled with dust and primitive charm, as the Kafir children sold their hand-carved toys. The Hex river valley and the Karoo offered breathtaking scenery that was a stark contrast to the chaos of the train stops. Suzanne and I marveled at the sights, almost missing the train at each impromptu halt. The natives appeared out of nowhere, offering their wares, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the simplicity and beauty of their creations.",1
"I struggled for what felt like an eternity to free myself from the tight bonds that held me captive. Through sheer determination, I managed to cut through the ropes around my wrists, restoring feeling to my hands. As I cautiously made my way through the deserted house, I overheard a conversation that sent chills down my spine. The mention of diamonds and secret information piqued my curiosity, but also filled me with dread. It was clear that danger lurked in the shadows, and I knew I had to tread carefully. Time was running out, and I needed to find a way out before it was too late.",1
"I yanked the cabin trunk closer, my voice sharp as I commanded: ""Show yourself now."" Silence greeted me. Leaning down, I spotted my unexpected guest motionless beneath the bunk. Was he asleep? I shook his shoulder, but he remained still. ""Passed out,"" I muttered in frustration. Panic set in as I noticed a crimson stain on the floor. With great effort, I pulled the man into the center of the cabin. His pallid face revealed unconsciousness. It didn't take long to locate the source - a brutal wound beneath his left shoulder. Stripping off his jacket, I focused on addressing the injury.",1
"Unbeknownst to me, I found a twisted satisfaction in witnessing her collapse. It revealed a vulnerability that I had failed to see before. She was, after all, just a young girl, her actions driven by thoughtless curiosity. ""I did try to warn you,"" I spoke softly. ""I suppose you did. Farewell."" ""Wait, you can't venture out alone in this state. It's too dangerous. I must escort you back to Merlinville."" ""Don't be absurd. I'm perfectly fine now."" ""What if you fall ill again? No, I will not let you go alone."" She fiercely argued against my proposition, her determination shining through.",1
"""In fact, I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have something to fall back on.” “Don’t tell me you hoard stamps!” “No, I live with a fascinating man. He’s a former detective from Belgium. He’s running a successful private investigation agency in London. He’s truly a remarkable individual. Time and time again, he has succeeded where the official authorities have not.” My friend listened intently. “That’s quite intriguing, isn’t it? I have a passion for crime. I watch all the mystery movies and eagerly follow murder cases in the news.” “Do you recall the Styles Case?” I inquired.",1
"""Please, Renauld,"" said M. Hautet, gesturing towards a chair. ""My heart goes out to you. The news must have come as a dreadful shock. But it's a stroke of luck that you were unable to set sail. Hopefully, you can provide us with the answers we seek to unravel this enigma."" Renauld nodded. ""I am here to help, M. le juge. Feel free to ask me anything."" ""Let's start with this - was this journey undertaken at your father's behest?"" ""Indeed, M. le juge. I received a telegram instructing me to travel urgently to Buenos Ayres, then through the Andes to Valparaiso and finally to Santiago.""",1
"""She never speaks of her past, or even mentions her husband. It is unclear whether he is alive or dead. There is an air of mystery surrounding her,"" I acknowledged, feeling my curiosity piqued. ""And the daughter?"" I inquired. ""A remarkably beautiful young woman, humble, religious, everything one could hope for. One can't help but feel sorry for her, because even if she is unaware of the past, any man seeking her hand in marriage would inevitably uncover the truth, and then..."" The detective shrugged dismissively. ""But it wouldn't be her fault!"" I protested, my anger mounting. ""No.""",1
"At the start of January, a month filled with detestable fog, a woman reveals her daring plan to blackmail the elusive 'Colonel' with unique diamonds hidden away from prying eyes. Despite her confidence, a mysterious man warns her of underestimating the 'Colonel's' wrath, hinting at a potential threat from her past. As she prepares to face the powerful 'Colonel,' she confides in the man about a husband from her native South Africa who will stand by her side. With secrets and danger lurking around every corner, she must tread carefully in a high-stakes game of deception and betrayal.",1
"In a series of events that I am about to recount, a unique sequence of events unfolded from the seemingly insignificant incidents that initially caught Poirot's eye to the dark occurrences that concluded a highly unusual case. That evening, I was in the company of my longtime friend, Gerald Parker. Apart from my host and me, there were approximately six other individuals present, and conversation naturally turned, as it always did whenever Parker was around, to the topic of searching for a residence in London. Dwellings, both houses and apartments, were Parker's particular passion.",1
"Pagett always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else. As I leisurely settled into my deck-chair next to Mrs. Blair, I couldn't help but comment on the state of the clergy in modern times. Casually, I extended an invitation to Mrs. Blair to join me for dinner on the evening of the upcoming Fancy Dress dance, a proposition that Race somehow finagled his way into as well. Following lunch, the Beddingfeld girl joined us for coffee, confirming my previous observation about the exceptional quality of her legs. Without a doubt, I will be extending an invitation to her for dinner too.",1
"Poirot suspected that the Robinsons were actually Elsa Hardt and her accomplice, using a common name to evade detection. The plan was to lure in their pursuers by offering a flat to a Mrs. Robinson. When the real Mrs. Robinson arrived, they would strike. Poirot, Hastings, and the Italian accomplice managed to capture Elsa Hardt, who revealed the location of the hidden goods. The American Secret Service agent, Mr. Burt, assisted in the arrest. Poirot, recovering from influenza, was ready to resume his detective work. Roger Havering urgently requested Poirot's presence in Derbyshire.",1
"Upon the recent publication of the great man's daily schedule, I had pinpointed his whereabouts. He was engrossed in dictating to his secretary in his residence. Knowing that a direct approach would be futile, I devised a clever strategy. By utilizing the Marquis of Loamsley's card, I gained access to Lord Nasby. Despite his initial outburst, I managed to present the details of the Mill House Mystery. Lord Nasby's interest was piqued, and he inquired about brachycephalic heads. Although my findings were deemed thin, I boldly requested a position on his paper to further investigate.",1
"With a peaceful night's rest, the boy could be fully recovered by morning, but any excitement might lead to dangerous brain fever. It was decided that someone should stay by his side throughout the night. After doing all we could, we entrusted Marthe and her mother with his care and headed into town. By this time, we were both starving, having missed our usual dinner hour. Luckily, the first restaurant we found satisfied our hunger with a delicious omelette and an equally satisfying entrecôte. ""Now we must find lodgings for the night,"" Poirot remarked after finishing our café noir.",1
"""Can you believe it, Poirot? The chambermaid was the culprit all along,"" I exclaimed, shocked at the revelation. Poirot merely chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. ""Indeed, my friend, appearances can be deceiving,"" he replied cryptically. The mystery of the stolen necklace had finally been solved, thanks to Poirot's ingenious plan to uncover the truth. As we left the scene of the crime behind us, I couldn't help but marvel at the brilliance of my quirky little friend. Our next adventure awaited, and I knew that with Poirot by my side, there was no puzzle we couldn't solve.",1
"""Crabtree Manor and all its contents are to be mine for a year after my uncle's death, during which time my niece can showcase her intelligence,"" read the terms. ""Once that year is up, the manor and my uncle's vast fortune will be donated to charitable causes, as my intelligence has surpassed that of my niece."" ""It seems unfair to you, as Mr. Marsh was your only living relative,"" the woman remarked. ""I don't see it that way. Uncle Andrew gave me fair warning, and I made my choice. Since I didn't comply with his wishes, he had every right to leave his wealth to whoever he pleased.""",1
"""I am quite famished,"" she whispered. ""Excellent. You're at the purser's table, correct? Confront him about the cabin."" Making my way to the saloon, I started to eat cautiously and ended up devouring a massive meal. My acquaintance from the day before commended me on my improved appetite. He informed me that everyone was changing cabins that day and assured me that my belongings would be transferred to an exterior one promptly. Our table consisted of only four individuals: myself, two older women, and a zealous missionary who frequently discussed ""our impoverished black brethren.""",1
"""Really?” “Yes, my dear Watson.” The revelation left me stunned. Holmes maintained a calm demeanor. “The detective inspector is clearly unaware of the true value. But chaos will ensue soon!” “Let's go!” I exclaimed, pulling at his coat sleeve. “Where to?” “We need to inform the Smithsons immediately.” “I disagree.” “What about the victim?” “Well; the victim, as you refer to her, will sleep soundly tonight thinking the treasures are secure.” “But the criminal might get away!” “Once again, my dear Watson, you jump to conclusions. How can you be certain the diamonds Mrs. Smithson...”",1
"I found a wallet containing a few notes and a couple of unimportant letters, along with a roll of films that I seemed to have misplaced later. There was also a scrap of paper with a meeting scheduled for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my rush to depart without being caught, I accidentally dropped the paper, but thankfully I memorized the details. After quickly removing my disguise in the nearest cloak-room to avoid suspicion, I headed back to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still at lunch, oblivious to my presence. I won't go into the specifics of how I tailed her to Marlow.",1
"The furniture and house had finally been sold off, managing to cover our outstanding debts. Despite my efforts, I had yet to secure a job. Truth be told, I wasn't exactly eager to find one! I firmly believed that if I sought out adventure, it would come to me. In my experience, one's desires always come to fruition. And soon enough, my belief was put to the test. It happened on a cold January 8th, right after an unsuccessful meeting with a woman seeking a secretary-companion, though it seemed she really needed a laborer willing to toil twelve hours a day for a measly £25 per year.",1
"""I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I declared with authority. “Take me to his private car immediately.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were surprised to see me on the observation platform. “Well, well, Miss Anne,” exclaimed Colonel Race. “Back from Durban, are you? What a pleasant surprise.” Suzanne remained silent, her eyes full of unspoken questions. “I must find my chief,” I stated calmly. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office compartment,” Colonel Race replied. “Dictating at a remarkable pace to Miss Pettigrew.” “Such dedication to work,” I remarked. “Indeed,” agreed Colonel Race.",1
"""I must admit, I can no longer hide the truth. You appear to be quite knowledgeable.” “I have utilized my intellect to my advantage. Let me be direct, Signor Ascanio, you paid a visit to the deceased on Tuesday morning, correct?” “Indeed; however, I did not return the next evening. It was unnecessary. Allow me to explain. This villain had obtained sensitive information about a prominent figure in Italy. He demanded a hefty sum for the documents. I traveled to England to settle the issue. I met with him as scheduled that morning. A young secretary from the Embassy accompanied me.""",1
"""The situation was undeniably perplexing. Although it was evident that the woman herself was not the perpetrator of the crime, as Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall when the gunshot rang out, there was undoubtedly a connection to the murder, given her sudden decision to flee. I immediately sent a message to Poirot and proposed heading back to London to investigate at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s response came swiftly: “No point in checking at the agency, they won’t have any information on her. Discover which vehicle transported her to hunters lodge upon her initial arrival.”""",1
"I was enjoying an evening with my friend, Gerald Parker. The conversation turned to house-hunting in London, a topic Parker was passionate about. He had moved from one flat to another, always finding new places. Mrs. Robinson shared that she and her husband had finally found a flat in Montagu Mansions for a surprisingly low price. Parker was astonished by the good deal, suspecting there must be a catch. Mrs. Robinson seemed uneasy, mentioning some strange things about the place that made her wonder if it was haunted. Parker dismissed the idea, but Mrs. Robinson was not convinced.",1
"The month was June, with daylight still lingering at eight o’clock but fading by half-past. Does that ring a bell? I sense a vague inkling that you will come around eventually. Moving on, the coffee was incredibly dark, in stark contrast to Count Foscatini’s gleaming white teeth. Coffee tends to stain teeth, leading us to deduce that Count Foscatini abstained from it. However, all three cups contained coffee. So, why would someone fabricate the notion that Count Foscatini had imbibed coffee when he hadn’t? Perplexed, I shook my head, seeking clarity. ""Let me assist you,"" he said.",1
"""Did you forget about the letter?” “No, I didn't forget. But why do you believe that letter was intended for M. Renauld?” “Well, it was discovered in his pocket and...” “That's it!” interrupted Poirot. “There was no indication of a recipient's name on the letter. We assumed it was for the deceased because it was in his overcoat pocket. But, my friend, something about that overcoat seemed odd to me. I measured it and commented on how long it was. That should have sparked some thoughts in your mind.” “I thought you were simply making an observation for the sake of it,” I admitted.",1
"""He detailed the strategies for housing the locals, the investigations launched, and the various safeguards implemented by De Beers.

You recall that case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?"" I nodded. ""Please, share the story,"" urged Miss Beddingfeld.",1

Sir Eustace chuckled, conceding defeat without any hint of emotion. ""Oh well,"" he commented.",1
"""It shatters my hypothesis; it devastates everything... no!"" He suddenly halted, hitting his chest. ""It's inconceivable. I can't be mistaken! The evidence, approached systematically and in the correct sequence, only allows for one interpretation. I must be correct! I am correct!"" ""But then..."" I began. He cut me off. ""Wait, my dear. I must be correct, therefore this recent homicide is implausible unless unless oh, hold on, I beg of you. Don't say a word.""

"A message from Poirot greeted me as I sat down to breakfast the next day: “It is clear that the man with the black beard was not Havering, only you or Japp would entertain such a notion. Send me details about the housekeeper and her attire this morning, as well as Mrs. Havering's. Skip the interior photographs - they lack artistry.” I found Poirot's tone needlessly sarcastic. It seemed to me that he might be envious of my advantage in being on site to handle the investigation. While his request for clothing descriptions struck me as absurd, I obliged as best as a mere man could.",1
"It was meticulous work, requiring careful planning and execution. The perpetrator had gone to great lengths to cover his tracks, disguising himself with a false beard and wig before carrying out the crime. The victim, Count Foscatini, had been found brutally murdered in his own flat, the murder weapon a marble statuette left lying nearby. The scene was eerily quiet, with the unfinished meal on the table suggesting that the crime had taken place during dinner. The doctor quickly confirmed that the victim had been killed instantly, leaving little chance for help to arrive in time.",1
"Poirot examined the crime scene meticulously, his attention caught by a piece of lead-piping near the spade. Giraud dismissed it as irrelevant, but Poirot's curiosity was piqued. He then proceeded to explore the locked shed, much to Giraud's annoyance. The detective seemed focused on trivial details, such as a whitewashed line around the grave, which he questioned M. Bex about. Despite Poirot's unconventional methods, Giraud was impressed by his efficiency. As they left the scene, Giraud continued his thorough search, while Poirot hinted at a deeper mystery surrounding the case.",1
"Poirot investigated the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had insured his life for a large sum of money. The cause of death was believed to be internal bleeding, but rumors of financial trouble surrounded the deceased. Poirot, accompanied by his friend Hastings, visited Marsdon Manor to speak with Dr. Bernard, the only doctor in the area. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was questioned about the events leading up to her husband's death. She revealed that he had a premonition of his death and had insured his life because of it. As they were about to leave, a tall young man approached them.",1
"They work together to pull him into the barn where the incident took place right outside. They immediately recognize the incredible opportunity that has presented itself. Although the man looks nothing like M. Renauld, he is a middle-aged, typical Frenchman. This will do. ""I suspect they sat on the nearby bench, away from the house, talking in private. They quickly devised a plan. The key to the identification will be based entirely on Madame Renauld's testimony. Jack Renauld and the loyal chauffeur (who had served his master for two years) need to be removed from the equation.""",1
"Upon discovering that none of the station's staff had seen the arrival of a mysterious, black-bearded stranger on the night of the crime, it became evident that the murderer must have used a waiting car for a quick getaway. This very same vehicle was likely responsible for transporting the enigmatic housekeeper to her new place of employment. Subsequent investigations at the London Agency confirmed Poirot's suspicions, as no record of a ""Mrs. Middleton"" could be found in their archives. The involvement of this mysterious figure only added another layer of complexity to the case.",1
"""And why does it all matter?"" scoffed Giraud. ""Because when you see two crimes with identical design and execution, you know the same mastermind is at work. I am on the hunt for that mastermind, Mr. Giraud, and I will uncover it. This is a genuine clue, a psychological clue. You may be an expert on cigarettes and match ends, Mr. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, understand the human psyche!"" The eccentric little man tapped his forehead for emphasis. Giraud remained unmoved. ""In addition,"" Poirot added, ""I will share one crucial detail with you that may have escaped your attention.",1
"""He’d arranged the stones on the path to create an illusion, luring unsuspecting victims into danger. If I get my hands on him, he'll regret it!"" After a pause, his tone shifted: ""We've avoided discussing these matters, Anne. It's time. You need to hear the whole truth from the very beginning."" ""If revisiting the past is painful for you, please don't feel obligated,"" I whispered softly. ""But I need you to understand. I never imagined I'd reveal that part of my past to anyone. Fate has a strange way of testing us, doesn't it?"" There was a moment of silence before he spoke again.",1
"""Informant, I must insist."" We had reached the stairs leading to the entrance of the Mansion. Inside, another officer was waiting. When the chief arrived, he asked for the whereabouts of Mr. Hautet. ""He's in the living room, sir."" Mr. Bex opened a door on the right, and we followed. Mr. Hautet and his assistant were seated at a large rectangular table. They glanced over as we stepped in. The chief introduced us and explained the reason for our visit. Mr. Hautet, the Investigating Judge, was a tall man with sharp eyes and a well-groomed grey beard that he stroked while speaking.",1
"""It's impossible! The housekeeper was there when the shot rang out."" ""Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she's vanished."" ""She'll turn up."" ""I doubt it. There's something mysteriously slippery about that housekeeper, wouldn't you say, Hastings? It struck me immediately."" ""She did her job, I suppose, and then disappeared just in time."" ""And what exactly was her job?"" ""Well, most likely to create an alibi for Mrs. Havering when the shot was fired."" ""Oh, no, that wasn't her job! Her job was exactly what you just mentioned, to give Mrs. Havering an alibi at the time the shot was fired.""",1
"""Listen, I'm not naive, sir. I can face the truth head-on. He's innocent, and we need to help him,"" she declared with determination, pausing briefly to reflect. Poirot studied her closely and asked, ""Is there something you're holding back, something that could be important for us to know?"" She hesitated before admitting, ""Yes, there is something, but it's so unbelievable that I'm not sure you'll take it seriously."" ""Please, go on,"" urged Poirot. ""Well, M. Giraud called me in at the last minute to see if I could identify the man inside,"" she revealed, gesturing towards the shed.",1

""Yesterday evening, the Prime Minister and his secretary, Captain Daniels"" ""The same one who went with him to France?"" ""Yes. As I was saying, they drove to Windsor, where the Prime Minister had a meeting. This morning, he came back to the city, and that's when the assassination attempt happened."" ""Hold on a moment. Who exactly is Captain Daniels? Do you have his background information?"" Lord Estair smirked.",1
"A few moments later, he returned with Mrs. Renauld. ""Madame is here,"" he announced. Giraud approached with a brief nod. ""Follow me, madame."" Leading her across the room, he suddenly stepped aside. ""Here stands the man. Do you recognize him?"" His piercing eyes studied her face intently, searching for any hint of emotion or familiarity. However, Mrs. Renauld remained unnervingly composed, almost too composed in my opinion. She gazed down at the body with little interest, showing no signs of distress or recognition. ""No,"" she replied calmly. ""I have never laid eyes on him before.""",1
"I caught her off guard with my announcement. ""South Africa? Oh Anne, we must tread carefully if we are to embark on such a journey."" I dreaded the thought of hesitation. I reassured her that my passage was already booked, and that upon arrival I intended to assume the role of a parlourmaid. It was a spontaneous decision, the only option that came to mind. I mentioned the high demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I convinced her that I was capable of looking after myself, and eventually, with a sense of relief in her voice, she agreed to the plan without further questioning.",1
"Poirot's revelation left us stunned. It seemed that Mr. Davenheim, the famous financier, had orchestrated his own disappearance to avoid the consequences of his financial misdeeds. The evidence pointed to a carefully planned scheme involving the theft of jewels and the creation of a false identity. As Poirot calmly explained his theory, it became clear that Mr. Davenheim had outwitted us all, hiding in plain sight where no one would think to look - in a prison. This unexpected turn of events shed a new light on the case, leaving us in awe of Poirot's brilliant deductive skills.",1
"They appeared as a pair of strikingly charming children. As they started to perform, their voices, while delicate and somewhat musical, held an undeniable allure. Their dance moves were precise, accompanied by impressive acrobatic displays. The lyrics of their songs were lively and memorable. The audience responded with a round of enthusiastic applause as the curtain closed, signaling the triumph of the Dulcibella Kids. Feeling a sudden urge to leave, I proposed to Poirot that we depart. ""Certainly, my friend. I am content here and will remain until the conclusion,"" he replied.",1
"We walked around the deck three times before settling into adjacent deck chairs. The night was silent, with no one else in sight. Colonel Race was a man of few words, a Rhodesian with a stern demeanor that intrigued me. As we sat there in silence, I couldn't help but wonder if he could be more than just a dance partner. I entertained the thought of marriage, even though he hadn't proposed. It was always best to be prepared, as the Boy Scouts say. In the dim light, I found myself considering the possibility of a future together, a future that seemed both thrilling and dangerous.",1
"""Come on now, sir, you can't underestimate the importance of details as clues, can you?"" ""Not at all. They all have their place. The risk is that they might be given too much significance. Most details are irrelevant; only a few are crucial. It's the mind, the little grey cells,"" he pointed to his head, ""that one must trust. The senses can be deceiving. The truth must be found internally, not externally."" ""Are you suggesting, Monsieur Poirot, that you could solve a case without even leaving your seat?"" ""That's exactly what I mean, provided that the facts were presented to me.""",1
"“I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle ” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening.",1
"“Listen here, that one is not meant for you! Trust me,” warned Papa Poirot. “But why,” I exclaimed, “the commissary assured me she was not only beautiful, but also virtuous! An absolute angel!”Poirot chuckled, “Some of the most notorious criminals I've encountered had the charm of angels. A deviation in the brain's cells can easily mask itself behind the face of innocence.”Shocked, I protested, “Poirot, you can't possibly think that a young, innocent girl like her could be involved in this!”“Now, now, calm down! I never said I suspected her of anything,"" Poirot replied calmly.",1
"""Listen, sir."" ""I would rather not speak in front of Miss Daubreuil."" ""As my daughter mentioned, she is not a child."" The magistrate paused, unsure for a moment. ""Alright, ma'am,"" he finally said. ""Let's do it your way. We suspect that you used to visit the deceased at his Villa in the evenings. Is that true?"" The lady's cheeks blushed slightly, but she responded calmly: ""I refuse to answer that question!"" ""Madam, we are investigating a homicide."" ""So what? I was not involved in the murder."" ""Madam, we are not implying that. However, you were acquainted with the deceased man.""",1
"""The meticulous examination of fingerprints and footprints, cigarette ash, various soil types, and other evidentiary traces is undeniably crucial."" ""Absolutely. I have never disputed that. The seasoned observer, the specialist, undoubtedly they are valuable! However, the likes of Hercules Poirot, they transcend the specialists! They are presented with the evidence by the experts, their concern is the crime's methodology, its reasoned inference, the correct arrangement and organization of the evidence; most importantly, the genuine psychological understanding of the situation.""",1
"I encountered a short, slender individual sporting facial hair, fixating his gaze upon me with intense scrutiny as if I were a specter. His intense emotions piqued my interest, prompting me to investigate further. After some inquiries at the inn, I discovered his identity as Carton, hailing from Kimberley, working as a diamond-sorter for De Beers. The familiar feeling of injustice resurfaced within me, leading me to depart for Kimberley. Despite my efforts, information on him remained scarce. Determined to confront him, I armed myself with a revolver for the impending meeting.",1
"I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown. “Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair...",1
"Suzanne looked at me with a mixture of excitement and determination. ""Anne, we're onto something big here,"" she said. ""Nadina, the diamonds, Colonel Race...it's all connected."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the implications of her words. This was no ordinary mystery we were unraveling. Suzanne leaned in closer, her eyes gleaming with anticipation. ""We need to dig deeper, Anne. There's more to this than meets the eye."" With a newfound sense of purpose, I nodded in agreement. It was time to uncover the truth behind the tangled web of secrets that lay before us.",1
"The detective from Scotland Yard exuded disdain, Major Norman appeared disinterested, and I myself felt time dragging on endlessly. Restlessly, I rose from my seat and made my way to the window without making a sound. The situation was turning into a comedy of errors. Concern for my friend weighed on me. If he were to fail, I wished it would be in a less absurd fashion. I absentmindedly gazed out the window at the departing boat, billowing smoke from its stack at the dock. Poirot's sudden voice near me snapped me back to reality. ""My friends, it's time to go!"" I turned around.",1
"""And what about Mrs. Ferguson?"" inquired Parker. ""Let's hear your deductions, Hastings."" ""It's elementary, my dear Watson,"" I quipped. ""She simply went to the incorrect apartment."" ""Impressive, Captain Hastings,"" Mrs. Robinson exclaimed with admiration. In that moment, I found myself yearning for Poirot's presence. At times, I believe he underestimates my abilities. The entire situation was quite amusing, so I presented it as a playful puzzle to Poirot the next day. He appeared intrigued, probing me for details on flat rents in different areas. ""An intriguing tale,"" he mused.",1
"""He hesitated. ""So you're saying,"" she murmured quietly, ""the confirmation of my husband's body?"" The judge inclined his head. ""I am a resilient woman, sir. I can handle whatever is asked of me. I am prepared now."" ""Oh, tomorrow will suffice, I promise you."" ""I would rather face it now,"" she uttered softly, a look of anguish briefly crossing her features. ""If you wouldn't mind offering me your arm, Doctor?"" The physician stepped forward, a cloak draped over Mrs. Renauld's shoulders, and a solemn procession descended the stairs. Mr. Bex rushed ahead to unlock the shed's door.""",1
"“You're telling me he was murdered yesterday morning?” “I connected it to the theft of the dagger,” Giraud clarified. “It's possible he was killed later in the day.” “Later in the day? Nonsense! This guy has been deceased for a minimum of forty-eight hours, maybe even longer.” We exchanged bewildered looks. The doctor's statement was so unexpected that we were momentarily stunned. A man was fatally stabbed with a dagger that had been reported stolen just a day ago, yet Dr. Durand insisted he had been dead for at least forty-eight hours! The situation was unbelievably bizarre.",1
"At this point, I am certain that you have transformed from Anne Beddingfeld to Lady Eardsley, residing in Park Lane. I want to assure you that I hold no grudge against you. Starting anew at my age is a challenge, but between us, I had a small savings set aside for such circumstances. It has proven to be quite helpful as I am building a new network. And if you happen to encounter your peculiar friend, Arthur Minks, please inform him that he is not forgotten. It will surely catch him off guard. Overall, I believe I have demonstrated a remarkably forgiving and merciful attitude.",1
"Johannesburg, March 6th. The atmosphere in this city is thick with tension, as if a storm is brewing just beneath the surface. It's like tiptoeing on the edge of a knife, never knowing when it will all come crashing down. Groups of protesters, or perhaps something more sinister, lurk in the shadows with a dangerous glint in their eyes. They seem to be marking their targets, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Even something as simple as taking a taxi becomes a risky endeavor, as these mysterious figures seem to have eyes everywhere, ready to pounce at a moment's notice.",1
"Poirot calmly read through his correspondence. There was a request to give a lecture to boy scouts, a Countess wanting his visit, and then, a mysterious letter caught his attention. It was from a man in France, seeking a detective discreetly. Poirot accepted the case without hesitation, sensing urgency. The man, Mr. Renauld, needed help and was willing to pay any price. Poirot and his companion quickly prepared to leave for France, intrigued by the unusual nature of the case. They were off to solve the mystery in Merlinville, a place that held secrets waiting to be uncovered.",1
"""I'm not sure."" He then blushed and continued with sudden intensity: ""Why did I say that? I truly loved my father. We exchanged harsh words the last time I saw him, and we argued often about my reckless behavior and debts, but I held affection for the old man. I realize now how much I cared, now that it's too late,"" he added more calmly. ""It was during my time at Cambridge that I encountered the other individual."" ""Young Eardsley?"" ""Indeed, young Eardsley. His father, as you are aware, was a prominent figure in South Africa. We immediately formed a bond, my companion and I.""",1
"""I've made a reappearance,"" I informed him gravely. ""How's everything, Mr. Pagett?"" ""All good, looking forward to getting back to work with Sir Eustace,"" he replied. ""There's something I need to ask you,"" I began cautiously. ""It's crucial, more than you realize. What were you doing in Marlow on January 8th?"" His reaction was immediate. ""Miss Beddingfeld, I..."" ""You were there, right?"" ""I had my reasons for being in the area,"" he admitted. ""Care to share those reasons with me?"" ""Hasn't Sir Eustace already filled you in?"" ""Sir Eustace? Does he know?"" ""I'm pretty sure he does.""",1
"At this point, he has provided a steady source of income for the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he is planning to break free from their grasp. Initially, their plan may have been to stop him from leaving. However, a more daring scheme emerges, one that does not seem to shock Jeanne Beroldy's daughter! Currently, M. Renauld is stubbornly blocking her path to marrying Jack. Should Jack choose to defy his father, he will be left with nothing, a prospect that does not sit well with Mademoiselle Marthe. It is quite possible that she has never truly cared for Jack Renauld.",1
"No sooner had Sir Eustace stepped outside than he reached for a speaking-tube resting nearby. ""Schwart, keep an eye on Minks. He is not allowed to leave the premises without my approval,"" he commanded before setting the tube back down. With a furrowed brow, he began tapping the table lightly with his hand. ""Sir Eustace, may I inquire about a few matters?"" I finally spoke up, breaking the silence that had settled between us. ""Of course. You truly possess remarkable composure, Anne. While others may be fretting and panicking, you exhibit a keen curiosity and presence of mind.""",1
"Yes, I was content, yet there lingered a sense of anticipation, as if something awaited me on the horizon. Restlessness tingled beneath my skin. Following our tea, we meandered outside, boarded the tram, and were guided by jovial attendants along the narrow rails to the bridge. The grandeur of the scene unfolded before us - the vast gorge, the tumultuous waters below, and the misty shroud that occasionally parted to reveal the majestic waterfall, only to quickly conceal it once more in enigmatic secrecy. This, I concluded, is the allure of the Falls - their enigmatic nature.",1
"“Shall we check in at our usual spot, the Hôtel des Bains?” Without hesitation, we headed over. The staff informed us that they had two available rooms with a view of the sea. Poirot then inquired about the arrival of an English lady named Miss Robinson. Turns out, she was in the small sitting room. As we walked down the corridor, I couldn't help but ask Poirot about Miss Robinson. His response? ""I have found you a wife, Hastings."" Shocked, I protested, but Poirot dismissed my concerns and ushered me into the room. And there she was, Cinderella herself, waiting to greet us.",1
"""So, based on your knowledge, he didn't have any enemies, and you have no idea about any secrets that might have led to his murder?"" ""That's correct."" ""M. Stonor, have you ever come across the name Duveen in relation to M. Renauld?"" ""Duveen. Duveen."" He pondered the name for a moment. ""I don't believe so. Although it does ring a bell."" ""Are you familiar with a woman, a friend of M. Renauld's named Bella?"" Once again, Mr. Stonor shook his head. ""Bella Duveen? Is that her full name? It's strange! I feel like I've heard it before. But I can't recall the context at the moment.""",1
"""You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?"" interposed M. Bex. ""No, I didn't. But it doesn't surprise me a bit."" ""Why?"" ""Because the old man was rattled! I don't know what it was all about."" ""Terrible, terrible,"" said M. Hautet. ""Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot's, Captain Hastings."" Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. ""Sent for you, did he?""",1
"In the corner by the fire-place stood a large writing-table. A man, or what once was a man, sat at the table. His right hand clutched the telephone base, but he lay forward, felled by a brutal blow to the head from behind. The murder weapon was easily found - a marble statuette with a bloodstained base. The doctor’s swift examination confirmed the worst. ""Stone dead. Death was quick. Surprising he even had time to make a call. Best not to disturb the body until the police come."" Following the manager's advice, we combed through the apartment, but the outcome was inevitable.",1
"She let out a muffled scream, and I couldn't help but gasp in shock. Standing before me was none other than Cinderella, my friend from the train! The feeling of astonishment was mutual. ""You,"" we both said at the same time. It was Cinderella who composed herself first. ""My dear Aunt!"" she cried. ""What brings you here?"" ""And what about you?"" I shot back. ""Just the other day, you were on your way back to England like a dutiful child. Did they give you a permanent pass to travel back and forth, thanks to your connections in Parliament?"" I paid no mind to the rest of her words.",1
"We managed to track down Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent, after a long search. He recognized the name Bella Duveen as one of the Dulcibella Kids, a pair of acrobat and singer sisters currently performing in Coventry. Poirot decided to attend their variety show, where he saw them perform and recognized Cinderella as one of the sisters. After the show, Cinderella approached us in fear, confessing that she was the one who took the dagger and asking if we would turn her in to the police. In a surprising turn of events, I declared my love for her and promised to protect her.",1
"Why didn't he just speak up? Was he worried about his past relationship with Marthe Daubreuil coming to light? I couldn't help but feel frustrated. It was just a harmless teenage romance, and I couldn't believe that the son of a millionaire would be dumped by a French girl who loved him. There had to be something more to it. The whole situation was confusing and left me feeling uneasy. I didn't want to be involved in tracking down this girl with Poirot, but I couldn't think of a way out without revealing everything to him, which I wasn't ready to do for some unknown reason.",1
"“Are you positive it was the same one?” “Absolutely sure. That’s what makes it so perplexing.” “Nothing is out of the realm of possibility. Perhaps there were two identical daggers.” I arched my eyebrows. “That seems incredibly unlikely. It would be an extraordinary stroke of luck.” “You are too hasty in your judgment, Hastings. In certain circumstances, having two of the same weapons would not be so far-fetched. This specific dagger was a custom creation ordered by Jack Renauld. When you really consider it, it is quite improbable that he would have commissioned only one.”",1
"""If O’Murphy is truly an honest man, what compelled him to veer off the main road? Conversely, if he was a man of deceit, what motivated him to restart the vehicle after only two shots rang out, quite possibly averting the Prime Minister’s demise? Moreover, if he was indeed honorable, why did he promptly head to a notorious haunt of German intelligence operatives upon departing Charing Cross?” “The situation appears rather dubious,” I remarked. “Let us approach this matter systematically. What evidence do we possess regarding these individuals? Let us begin with O’Murphy.""",1
"""What scared him? It wasn't me. But someone could have been approaching us on the platform, someone he knew.""""Did you see anyone?"" ""No,"" I confessed. ""I didn't look back. Then, after the body was pulled from the tracks, a man came forward to inspect it, claiming to be a doctor.""""Nothing out of the ordinary in that,"" the inspector remarked dryly. ""But he wasn't a doctor.""""What?""""He wasn't a doctor,"" I reiterated. ""How can you be sure of that, Miss Beddingfeld?""""It's hard to explain, really. I served in a hospital during the war, and I've observed how doctors handle corpses.",1
"I need to get a full grasp of this Rand situation. The dancing was quite intense. I had a couple of dances with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to act like she was enjoying herself. There was one dance with Mrs. Blair, who didn't bother pretending, and I also danced with a few other ladies who caught my eye. Afterwards, we headed to supper. I had requested champagne; the steward recommended Clicquot 1911 as the top choice on the ship and I agreed. It turned out to be the key to getting Colonel Race to open up. Instead of his usual reserved self, he became surprisingly chatty.",1
"""I understand,"" I whispered softly. ""No words from you could be too harsh, Your Honor."" ""You didn't plan for this woman to be here?"" ""Absolutely not. I bumped into her unexpectedly. She's an English visitor in Merlinville, though I didn't know that until we crossed paths."" ""Hmm,"" the judge responded, his tone mellowing. ""It was against the rules, but I assume the lady is youthful and attractive, isn't she? Ah, to be young! O youth, youth!"" he sighed wistfully. The inspector, less sentimental and more pragmatic, asked, ""But didn't you shut and lock the door when you left?""",1
"""Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago.",1
"She was a tall, striking young woman who arrived promptly, dressed simply yet elegantly, exuding confidence and professionalism. I've never been a fan of the so-called New Woman, and despite her attractiveness, I was not immediately swayed in her favor. ""My business with you, Monsieur Poirot, is rather unconventional,"" she started, settling into her seat. ""I believe it is best to start from the beginning and provide you with the full details."" ""Please, go ahead, mademoiselle."" ""I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, both sons of a humble farmer in Devonshire.""",1
"""After the incident with Sir Eustace, I was left feeling uneasy. His peculiar sense of humor and covert jokes had put me on edge. I knew I had made a mistake by going to Marlow, but it felt natural at the time. Miss Beddingfeld's curiosity only added to my discomfort. When she finally pushed me to reveal my secret, I hesitated. But in three short sentences, I confessed. It was not what she expected. As I walked back to the hotel, a wire arrived, directing me to proceed to Johannesburg. Signed by Harry, not Andy. Sitting down to think, I knew my life was about to change.""",1
"""By Jove, Poirot! I swear, I would pay a handsome sum to witness you truly make a fool of yourself just once. Your vanity knows no bounds!"" ""Please, do not distress yourself, Hastings. Honestly, there are moments when I believe you despise me! Ah, the burdens of brilliance!"" With a theatrical sigh, the little man inflated his chest, provoking a chuckle from me. On Tuesday, we embarked on a swift journey to Liverpool aboard a luxurious first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot stubbornly kept his suspicions and certainties shrouded in mystery, much to my frustration.",1
"""Came up against a brick wall at the entrance, but that stubborn French gendarme was not budging. Even if I brought out Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots all at once, it wouldn’t make a difference to him! It’s a stroke of luck running into you like this. Come on, give me the grand tour.” “Hold on a second, I can’t do that. It’s off limits to everyone. They enforce the rules strictly.” “Aren’t you two big shots?” I was reluctant to let go of my sense of importance. “What’s driving your curiosity?” I asked hesitantly. “And what exactly do you want to see.”",1
"""So, what do we know about Rayburn? He's got a scar, sure, but that could easily be a fake. He fits the height and build profile though. Can you remember the details of the head you described to the police at Scotland Yard?"" My heart raced. Suzanne was intelligent and well-educated, but I hoped she wasn't familiar with the technical jargon of anthropology. ""Dolichocephalic,"" I replied casually. Suzanne seemed uncertain. ""Are you sure?"" ""Absolutely. It means long-headed, with a width less than 75 percent of its length,"" I explained smoothly. There was a moment of silence.",1
"Asking for a search, the chambermaid leaves the room unblemished. The fake necklace hidden in the French girl's bed was a masterstroke. Poirot reveals his trip to London to show a card with fingerprints. The thieves were caught, their method failed. Mrs. Opalsen mentions her pearls, and Poirot suggests a return visit. The author reflects on Poirot's role in averting a national crisis. Poirot and the author discuss the attempted assassination of the Prime Minister. Poirot deals with a charlady's case before receiving important visitors - Lord Estair and Mr. Bernard Dodge.",1
"Colonel Race stood up. “Good morning Lucas,” he greeted. Harry suddenly blushed deeply. “Yes, I suppose it’s time to use your true name,” I joked. But Harry's attention remained fixed on Colonel Race. “You recognize me, sir,” he finally admitted. “I have a good memory for faces. I remember seeing you when I was a child.” Confused, I interjected, trying to understand the tension between them. Colonel Race prevailed. Harry shifted his gaze. “I guess you’re right, sir. Go ahead and tell her my real name.” “Anne, this man is not Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas died during the War.”",1
"I had been waiting for this moment. I was cautious, resisting the urge to react impulsively. Slowly, I succumbed to the pressure and coercion. Under Sir Eustace's guidance, I penned a letter: Dearest Harry, there is a glimmer of hope to prove your innocence unequivocally. Follow my directives precisely. Visit Agrasato's antique store. Request to view something ""uncommon,"" ""for a special event."" The proprietor will invite you to the ""rear chamber."" Accompany him. A messenger will be waiting to escort you to me. Obey his every command. Remember to bring the diamonds along.",1
"We bid you goodnight, Monsieur Poirot. I see the wheels turning in your mind,"" Poirot smiled. ""I would be happy to join you. Hastings, go fetch a taxi,"" he said. Taxis always seem scarce when you're in a hurry, but we managed to find one and headed towards Regent's Park. Regent's Court, a modern apartment building near St. John's Wood Road, was our destination. The building was equipped with all the latest technology. The hallway was empty. The doctor impatiently rang the bell for the lift, and when it arrived, he interrogated the attendant about the location of Flat II.",1
"“I love you? How is that possible, given everything you know about me?” “I'm not sure,” I replied, feeling a sense of exhaustion wash over me. “Love is a force beyond control. I've attempted to resist it from the moment we first crossed paths. But love, it seems, is more powerful than my will.” Unexpectedly, she collapsed to the ground once more, consumed by uncontrollable sobs. “I can't go on like this!” she wailed. “I'm lost, with no direction. Please, someone, have mercy on me and show me the way!” Once again, I knelt beside her, offering what comfort I could muster.",1
"""I never trusted you,"" she said sharply. ""It's not that simple,"" he replied. ""I had grown cynical and suspicious, always searching for hidden agendas. Your care and concern felt like a breath of fresh air."" As he spoke, she couldn't help but notice inconsistencies in his story - promises of money, talk of buying back stolen diamonds, and a deliberate distance in his descriptions of the men involved. And then she realized, when he said ""my friend,"" he wasn't referring to Eardsley, but to Lucas. It was Lucas, the unassuming one, who had been in love with Nadina all along.",1
"""I've always heard that he acquired his wealth in a secretive manner,"" mused Suzanne. ""But that doesn't necessarily imply criminal activity. It could be something as mundane as selling office supplies or beauty products!"" I responded with a hint of regret. ""Perhaps,"" Suzanne hesitated, ""we're on the wrong track? What if we're being misled by suspecting Pagett's involvement? What if he's truly an upright citizen?"" I pondered this briefly before shaking my head. ""I find that hard to believe."" ""He does have an explanation for everything."" ""True, but they lack credibility.""",1
"“There’s something off about this situation,” he muttered. “First off, where the hell is Rayburn?” It’s true that we haven’t laid eyes on him since we got ashore. He didn’t even bother coming up to the hotel with us. I highly doubt he’s scared of Pagett, though. The whole thing is just plain frustrating. One secretary has disappeared without a trace, and the other one looks like a washed-up boxer. I can’t have him by my side looking like that. I’ll become the town’s joke. I have a meeting later to hand over old Milray’s love letter, but I won’t be bringing Pagett along.",1
"""Yet the fearless shop owner adamantly rejected their demand. Enraged by his defiance, one of the individuals promptly plunged a knife into his chest. Utilizing the victim's keys, they unlocked the secure compartment tucked away in the room, snatching a multitude of documents. Both suspects sported thick beards and concealed their identities behind masks, although Madame Beroldy confidently identified them as Russians. The incident sparked widespread shock and intrigue, earning labels such as ""the Nihilist Tragedy,"" ""Insurgents of Paris,"" and the ""Enigma from the East.""",1
"Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",1
"As I observed the man, I noted his petite frame and tanned complexion, coupled with piercing blue eyes and a neatly trimmed beard. ""Freshly returned from a foreign land,"" I concluded. ""The scent of his overcoat gives away his recent journey from India. Not military, for a soldier would be clean-shaven. Could he be a tea cultivator instead?"" Suddenly, the man pivoted, as if considering retracing his path on the platform. His gaze briefly met mine before shifting to a point beyond, causing a sudden transformation in his expression - one of terror bordering on sheer panic.",1
"Flemming and her friends appeared to be incredibly mundane to me. Their conversations revolved around themselves, their children, and the struggles of procuring quality milk for their little ones. They would then transition to discussing the challenges of finding reliable servants, recounting their interactions with the staff at the Registry Office. It was rare to see them engage with current events or show any interest in the world beyond their comfort zone. They harbored a distaste for travel, finding everything abroad too unfamiliar compared to their beloved England.",1
"""An elderly man stood by the mantelpiece, his shoulders slightly stooped. Dr. Durand was his name. “Most extraordinary,” M. Hautet remarked after the commissary spoke. “Do you have the letter, Monsieur?” Poirot handed it over, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. A secret is mentioned. What a pity he did not provide more details. We are grateful for your help, M. Poirot. Will you assist in our investigations? Or must you return to London?” “M. le juge, I intend to stay. I may not have arrived in time to save my client, but I feel compelled by honor to uncover the killer.""",1
"“Have you calmed down now and are you ready to share what's really going on?” I inquired. He hesitated, then replied, “I'm afraid I can't indulge your curiosity at the moment.” Disappointed, I pressed, “And why is that?” He smirked sardonically. “If you want something spread around, just tell a woman. Otherwise, keep quiet.” Feeling slighted, I retorted, “Are you implying I can't keep a secret?” His response was noncommittal. Rising from his seat, he remarked, “In any case, you'll likely have plenty to say about tonight's events.” Outraged, I exclaimed, “How dare you!”",1
"He stared at me, a sly smile playing on his lips. ""You've erred, haven't you?"" I shook my head. ""I highly doubt it."" ""You've handed me the incorrect scroll. This one is unexposed."" I exited with all the poise I could gather. It's humbling to recognize one's own foolishness from time to time! But no one enjoys the revelation. As I passed by a prominent shipping company, I abruptly stopped. A stunning replica of the company's ship, labeled ""Kenilworth Castle,"" caught my eye. A reckless notion crossed my mind. Without hesitation, I pushed the door open and stepped inside.",1
"""Enthralled by the tale proposed by Madame Daubreuil, she willingly allows herself to be silenced and tied up. Well, Poirot, what's your take on this?"" I reclined, beaming with the satisfaction of a successful reconstruction. Poirot gazed at me pensively. ""You should consider writing for the cinema, my friend,"" he finally commented. ""You think?"" ""It would translate well onto screen, the narrative you've just shared with me, but it lacks realism."" ""I confess I haven't delved into all the specifics, yet..."" ""You've gone beyond that - you've skillfully disregarded them.""",1
"""Excuse me, but could you please unlock Mr. Opalsen's room for me?"" Poirot asked the chambermaid. She led the way to the room, unlocking it with her pass-key. Poirot showed her a card, asking if she had seen it before, but she hadn't. Poirot then asked the valet the same question, with no luck. As Poirot prepared to leave for London, he asked Hastings to brush off some French chalk powder from his coat sleeve. The next day, Poirot revealed that the chambermaid and valet were the culprits behind the theft of the necklace, using a clever plan involving the French chalk.",1
"“His partners may have silenced and drugged him,” she pondered, “but I struggle to discern their motive. His value to them is minimal now, as he will undoubtedly be under intense surveillance until the enigma surrounding the Prime Minister is resolved.” “Could it be an attempt to mislead the authorities?” “If so, why the lack of effort? His account only mentions a cloth over his face, followed by darkness. There is no diversion in that. It appears quite close to reality.” “Very well,” she remarked, checking the time, “I believe it is time to head towards the station.”",1
"""Sir Laurence Eardsley wielded great power. He managed to have the charges dropped, but it resulted in the ruin of two young men who now bore the shame of being labeled as thieves. It was a heavy blow for the elderly man, his heart shattered by the outcome. A bitter confrontation ensued between father and son, where harsh words were exchanged. Despite Sir Laurence's efforts to protect the family reputation, his son was forever estranged. The young man, full of pride and stubbornness, chose to remain silent, refusing to defend himself against his father's accusations.""",1
"As a crime novelist, I understand the importance of maintaining suspense and intrigue in a story. The key details of a murder investigation, the psychological clues, and the unique personalities of the characters are essential to keeping the reader engaged. In my writing, I strive to create a narrative that is both complex and captivating, drawing the reader in with unexpected twists and turns. By carefully crafting the structure of the story and the interactions between the characters, I aim to create a gripping tale that keeps the reader guessing until the very end.",1
"Beside him lay the empty cup. I quickly went to his side, then hurried out and made my way across the camp to Dr. Ames’s tent. “Dr. Ames!” I shouted. “Hurry.” “What’s wrong?” asked the doctor, emerging in his pajamas. “My friend. He’s sick. Dying. The chamomile tea. Stop Hassan from leaving the camp.” The doctor sprinted to our tent. Poirot was still on the bed. “Incredible,” exclaimed Ames. “Looks like a fit or something he ingested?” He examined the empty cup. “But I didn’t drink it!” a calm voice declared. We spun around in surprise. Poirot was now sitting upright.",1
"I glanced up to find her eyes peering mischievously over the edge. Despite myself, a smile crept onto my face, prompting her to chuckle heartily and discard the paper. ""I knew you had some wit hidden beneath that facade,"" she exclaimed. Her laughter was so contagious that I couldn't resist joining in, even though I wasn't fond of being called a ""mutt."" Although the girl possessed qualities I typically found unappealing, I decided not to be overly serious. I relaxed my stance. In the end, she was undeniably attractive. ""See, we're pals now!"" she announced with a smirk.",1
"I presented myself as a potential renter. My target was the local real estate agents, who had a limited number of properties available. However, I underestimated my opponent. A friendly clerk provided details on several attractive properties. I had to use all my cunning to come up with flaws for each one. In the end, I was afraid I had hit a dead end. ""Do you have anything else?"" I inquired, feigning desperation. ""Perhaps something by the river, with a sizable garden and a small lodge,"" I mentioned, summarizing the key features of the Mill House, based on my research.",1
"She hopped onto the train at the very last moment, gasping for breath as if she had just finished a marathon, yet Pagett claimed he saw her boarding a train to Durban the previous night! Either Pagett was intoxicated once again or the girl must have a supernatural presence. And she never offers any explanation. No one ever does. Ah, the ""Secretaries I have encountered."" The first, a fugitive murderer on the run. The second, a hidden drinker involved in scandalous affairs in Italy. The third, a stunning woman with the uncanny ability to be in two places simultaneously.",1
"""There was clearly going to be tension between the examining magistrate and the detective leading the case. They clashed from the beginning. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were incompetent, while M. Hautet, who was very serious, took offense at the laid-back attitude of the Paris detective. “Well, M. Giraud,” the magistrate said sharply. “I assume you have made great progress? You already know who the killers are, correct? And you also know exactly where they are hiding now?” Unfazed by the sarcasm, Giraud answered: “I at least know where they originated from.""",1
"""Do you think you'd be able to identify Chichester if he were in a different disguise?"" Suzanne inquired. I shook my head, admitting, ""I didn't even recognize him as the stewardess, and wouldn't have without your sketch."" ""He must be a professional actor,"" Suzanne mused. ""His make-up is truly remarkable. He could walk off the boat looking like a laborer, and no one would suspect a thing."" ""You're not exactly reassuring,"" I remarked. Just then, Colonel Race entered through the window and joined us. ""Where is Sir Eustace?"" Suzanne inquired. ""I haven't seen him today.""",1
"""I rolled my eyes, a hint of irritation creeping in. “But don't worry, my friend,” Poirot reassured, his tone softening. “Not everyone can be as extraordinary as Hercule Poirot! I am fully aware of that.” “You really do have a high opinion of yourself,” I remarked, torn between amusement and exasperation. “What can I say? When one is truly unique, one cannot help but know it! And from what I gather, others seem to agree, including, if I'm not mistaken, Miss Mary Marvell.” “What?” “No doubt about it. She's on her way here.” “How do you know that?” “It's quite simple.",1
"""I rushed to offer my own perspective. 'You have faith in the triumph of this Uprising? You've committed fully.' 'For someone as intelligent as you are, that's a remarkably foolish comment. No, my dear, I do not have faith in this Uprising. I predict it will die down disgracefully in a couple of days.' 'Not a victory for you, then?' I remarked harshly. 'Just like all women, you lack an understanding of business. The task I undertook was to deliver specific explosives and weapons for a hefty sum to stir up general unrest, and to fully implicate certain individuals.'""",1
"“Indeed, Renauld, it is unfortunately true! A perfect little weapon, I suspect. Sleek and simple to wield.” “Where is it located? Can I have a look at it? Is it still inside the corpse?” “Oh, no, it had already been extracted. You desire to examine it? Just to confirm? It would be wise, I believe, even though madame has already recognized it. But M. Bex, could I ask you?” “Of course, M. le juge. I will retrieve it promptly.” “Might it not be preferable to bring M. Renauld to the barn?” proposed Giraud smoothly. “Undoubtedly he would want to see his father’s remains.",1
"""Mrs. Blair complimented, tilting her head. ""Share your story, Gipsy girl. What's your reason for heading to South Africa?"" I mentioned Papa's mission. ""So you're Charles Beddingfeld's daughter? You're not just an ordinary Miss, are you? Off to Broken Hill to dig up more skeletons?"" ""Possibly,"" I replied carefully. ""I have other plans too."" ""You're quite the enigmatic one.

She yawned, resembling a drowsy kitten.",1
"""My initial plan was to spend a few days exploring the Falls, a sight I have yet to witness despite this being my third trip to Africa. Afterwards, I intended to travel to Jo’burg to analyze the state of affairs on the Rand. Back in my country, I am regarded as an expert on South African politics. However, based on what I have been told, Jo’burg will soon become a rather inhospitable destination. I have no desire to investigate the situation amidst a potential uprising."" Race responded with a condescending smile. ""I believe your concerns are unfounded, Sir Eustace.""",1
"At the sight of her son, caught between the two enforcers of the law, she froze in shock. ""Jack,"" she whispered. ""Jack, what's going on?"" He met her gaze, his expression impassive. ""I've been taken into custody, mother."" ""What?"" Her cry was sharp, piercing the air, before she collapsed to the ground. Hastening to her side, we quickly lifted her limp form. After a moment, Poirot rose to his feet. ""She's sustained a nasty gash on her head, most likely from the stairwell. There may be a mild concussion as well. If Giraud needs a statement from her, he'll have to wait.""",1
"He managed to have the case thrown out, but it resulted in two young men being ruined and publicly shamed as thieves. It shattered the old man's heart. After a bitter confrontation with his son, he disowned him completely. The son, in his pride, chose to remain silent, refusing to defend his innocence to his father. Enraged after the encounter, he met up with his friend, and a week later they both enlisted in the war together. Tragically, his friend was killed due to reckless behavior. The man's death was a devastating blow, leaving his reputation tarnished forever.",1
"I waited for what felt like an eternity before I could finally feel the warmth returning to my hands. Rubbing my wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag that silenced me. Taking a few deep breaths, I managed to loosen the last knot, though it took some time before I could stand. Finally on my feet, I swung my arms to restore circulation, longing for a meal. After waiting to ensure my strength had returned, I silently made my way to the door. To my relief, it was only latched, not locked. I carefully unlatched it and peered out, making sure not to make a sound.",1
"Upon investigating, we notice three instances where M. Renauld's behavior shifts dramatically, indicating three crucial psychological turning points. The first occurs upon his arrival in Merlinville, the second following a heated argument with his son, and the third on the morning of June 7th. The reasons behind these changes are as follows: the influence of Madame Daubreuil is to blame for the first, the impending marriage between Renauld's son and Daubreuil's daughter for the second, but the root cause of the third remains elusive, requiring deduction on our part.",1
"""And the Minister quickly departed. Major Norman and I engaged in casual conversation. Among the cluster of men nearby, I spotted a sly-looking individual conversing with a tall, blonde man. It was none other than Inspector Japp, a familiar face to Poirot and known as one of Scotland Yard's finest. Inspector Japp approached us with a friendly greeting. 'I heard you were involved in this case as well. Quite a clever operation so far. The culprits have managed to evade capture thus far, but I have my doubts about their ability to keep him concealed for much longer.'""",1
"“But what is it about him that draws you in? I fail to see any appeal in him, aside from his daring good looks and his modern-day caveman approach to love.” I vented my frustration towards Suzanne for a few moments. “Just because you’re happily married and letting yourself go, you seem to have forgotten about the existence of romance,” I concluded. “Oh, I’m not letting myself go, Anne. The stress of worrying about you lately must have taken a toll on me.” “You appear to be in good shape,” I remarked coolly. “I’d venture to guess you’ve gained at least five pounds.”",1
"“Poirot was about to continue when the door burst open, revealing a magnificent figure. With his impeccably styled black hair and polished boots, Gregory Rolf entered the room exuding an air of heroism. ""I promised to stop by, Mary,"" he announced. ""So here I am. What's Poirot's take on our little predicament? Thinks it's all a hoax, like me?"" Poirot gazed up at the imposing actor, the two of them an odd pair. ""Whether hoax or not, Mr. Rolf,"" he remarked wryly, ""I've advised your wife against bringing the jewel to Yardly Chase on Friday."" ""Couldn't agree more, sir.”",1
"His cohorts could have used a different method to incapacitate him, but the end goal remains unclear. He is not of much value to them now, given the current circumstances surrounding the Prime Minister. As we made our way to the station, I glanced at the clock. We may uncover more information in France, but the mystery of the Prime Minister's disappearance remains unsolved. At Charing Cross, we were greeted by Mr. Dodge and introduced to Detective Barnes and Major Norman. The search for the missing Prime Minister continues as we delve deeper into the investigation.",1
"We shared a passion for South Africa and a mutual interest in exploring remote corners of the globe. Following his departure from Cambridge, Eardsley had a falling out with his father over financial matters. Sir Laurence, having already bailed out his son twice before, refused to do so again, leading to a heated confrontation. Determined to make it on his own, Eardsley and his companion embarked on a diamond prospecting venture in South America. The details of their expedition are not relevant at the moment, but our time in that exotic land was truly unforgettable.",1
"With an air of nonchalance, I approached the lady who appeared to be in charge of the ship. Her fair hair and blue eyes gave her an air of elegance, and her Parisian clothes spoke of sophistication. As she commanded the deck stewards to rearrange her chair multiple times, I couldn't help but be intrigued by her confidence and charm. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted and how to get it, a rare quality indeed. Perhaps, once I regained my strength, I would strike up a conversation with her, if only to learn her secret to navigating the world with such finesse.",1
"“Absolutely nothing. I’m terrible at dealing with business matters.” “I see. So you have no idea why he suddenly decided to take out a life insurance policy? He hadn’t done so before, is that correct?” “We had only been married for a little over a year. But the reason he got the life insurance was because he was convinced that he wouldn’t live much longer. He had a strong feeling that his death was near. He had already suffered from a hemorrhage, and he believed that another one would be fatal. I tried to reassure him, but he was convinced of his impending death.”",1
"""No need to be upset, Anne. I was just joking around. Come sit here. Putting jokes aside, I believe you've stumbled upon something crucial. We've always assumed Pagett had an alibi. Now we know he doesn't."" ""Exactly,"" I replied. ""We need to keep a close watch on him."" ""And on everyone else too,"" she added with a hint of regret. ""Actually, that's one of the topics I wanted to discuss with you. That, and our finances. Please, don't act all high and mighty. I understand you value your pride and independence, but you need to consider some practicality in this matter.""",1
"""Urgent matter. Yours faithfully, P. T. RENAULD."" A barely legible plea followed the signature: ""For God’s sake, come!"" Returning the letter, I felt a surge of anticipation. ""Finally, something unusual,"" I remarked. ""Absolutely,"" Poirot concurred thoughtfully. ""You will be going, correct?"" I asked. Poirot nodded, deep in thought. After a moment, he made a decision and checked the time. His expression was serious. ""Time is of the essence. The Continental express departs Victoria at 11 o’clock. No need to fret, we have ample time. Let's take ten minutes to discuss.""",1
"He appeared to be in his forties, with a hint of silver hair framing his temples, and undoubtedly the most handsome passenger on the ship. I inquired with the stewardess about the identity of the captivating lady beside me. ""That is the Honorable Mrs. Clarence Blair, a prominent figure in high society. Surely you have heard of her in the newspapers."" I acknowledged, studying her with a newfound curiosity. Mrs. Blair was renowned as one of the most fashionable women of her time. I couldn't help but notice that she was commanding a considerable amount of admiration.",1
"He walked past us without acknowledging our presence, but I couldn't help noticing his striking appearance - a lean, sun-kissed face that hinted at a life spent in tropical lands. Poirot approached the gardener, who had momentarily paused from his leaf-clearing duties. ""Do you know that gentleman?"" Poirot inquired urgently. ""He was here last week, Tuesday night."" We hurried after the mysterious man, witnessing a tense encounter with Mrs. Maltravers. As Poirot delved deeper into the investigation, a shocking revelation emerged, leading to a dramatic turn of events.",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had captivated Paris, graciously acknowledged the applause, her black eyes gleaming and scarlet lips curling upwards. The Manager, a bearded gentleman, embraced her warmly, praising her exceptional performance. Bouquets and futuristic garments filled her dressing room, the air heavy with the scent of blossoms and perfumes. When Count Sergius Paulovitch arrived, Nadina's demeanor shifted subtly. They conversed in English, revealing a shared heritage. Despite her success, Nadina expressed unease about lingering suspicions from the War.",1
"Poirot muttered softly: ""Ah, c’est comme ça!"" Then, displaying his usual knack for accuracy (which he preferred to call psychology), he remarked, ""So you must be familiar with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?"" ""Gregory crossed paths with her during her time out West three years back,"" Miss Marvell revealed. After a brief pause, she blurted out, ""Do either of you follow Society Gossip?"" We both admitted guilt with a hint of embarrassment. ""I inquire because the latest issue features an article on renowned jewels, and it's quite intriguing,"" she trailed off.",1
"The farm was not prosperous, leading the older brother, Andrew, to move to Australia where he found success through land speculation, eventually becoming wealthy. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no interest in farming and instead worked as a clerk after some self-education. He married up, to my mother, the daughter of a struggling artist. My father passed when I was six, and my mother followed when I was fourteen, leaving my Uncle Andrew as the only family I had left. He had just come back from Australia and purchased Crabtree Manor in our home county.",1
"When Pagett informed me of his affiliation with the Secret Service, a chill ran down my spine. Memories of his presence in Paris during the War, particularly his interest in Nadina, fueled my growing unease. The suspicion that he was now targeting me gnawed at my thoughts. His unwavering shadowing of my every move only heightened my concerns. Pagett embodied the archetype of the strong, silent man with a hidden agenda. As a whistle pierced the air, Sir Eustace attended to the urgent call. ""Business,"" he muttered before turning to Miss Anne to lead her to her room.",1
"""And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.",1
"""But I am not one to partake in the frantic pursuit of a needle in a haystack, as you English say. Let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. I am confident that I will locate her when the time is right. For now, I am willing to be patient."" I gazed at him skeptically. Was he trying to deceive me? I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still in control of the situation. My feeling of superiority was slowly fading. Despite orchestrating the girl's escape and devising a clever plan to protect her from the repercussions of her impulsive actions, I couldn't shake my unease.",1
"I wiped away my tears, feeling the lingering weakness in my body. Gripping his hand tightly, I wished for a peaceful death in that moment, under his watchful gaze. His eyes held a new intensity, a protective glint that soothed me. ""Please, Anne, no more tears. You're safe now,"" he reassured me, offering a cup of milk. I drank without hesitation, listening to his comforting words, spoken in a gentle, coaxing tone. ""Rest now, don't worry. Let your strength return. No need for questions."" And with that, I drifted back into slumber, feeling reassured by his presence.",1
"""As we returned to the flat, Poirot's expression changed. He leaned in and whispered, 'A man of method is at play here.' I couldn't help but ask, 'The murderer, or Count Foscatini?' Poirot's response was cryptic, 'The latter was certainly meticulous. Even in his plea for help and prediction of his demise, he made sure to delicately place the telephone receiver back in its cradle.' His words sparked a realization in me, 'You suspect poison?' I gasped. Poirot's smile was enigmatic. We entered the flat to find the local inspector and two constables waiting for us.""",1
"""I will definitely assist you in any way I can,"" the young soldier responded. ""Unfortunately, I did not observe anything unusual. Maltravers was a family friend, but I did not know him well personally."" ""When did you arrive?"" ""On Tuesday afternoon. I left for London early Wednesday morning, my boat departing from Tilbury around noon. However, I had to change my plans due to some news I received, as I mentioned to Mrs. Maltravers."" ""You were heading back to East Africa, correct?"" ""That's right. I've been there since the War - it's a remarkable country."" ""Indeed.""",1
"""I'm sorry, but I am far from convinced that Jack Renauld is guilty,"" Poirot stated firmly. Giraud couldn't help but laugh, shaking his head in disbelief. Poirot's eyes flashed dangerously. ""Your disrespectful attitude towards me throughout this investigation will not go unpunished. I propose a wager - 500 francs says that I will identify M. Renauld's killer before you. Do we have a deal?"" Giraud was speechless, muttering under his breath once more. ""Let's settle this once and for all,"" Poirot insisted. ""Do we have a deal?"" Giraud hesitated, clearly taken aback.",1
"I could sense the hopelessness in Poirot's gaze. Together, we pushed against the door with all our strength. From the window, Cinderella's voice pierced through the tension, cool and detached: ""You'll never make it in time. I suppose it's up to me."" Before I could react, she seemed to launch herself into the void. I scrambled to the window and peered out. My heart stopped as I witnessed her hanging from the rooftop, inching her way towards the illuminated window. ""Dear God! She's risking her life,"" I exclaimed. ""Don't forget, Hastings. She's a seasoned acrobat.""",1
"I grow weary of having only Miss Pettigrew for company. “You’re in Jo’burg?” I inquired casually. “When did you get here?” “Just last night.” “Where are you lodging?” “With some friends.” He appeared unusually reserved, almost uncomfortable with my inquiries. “Let’s hope they have chickens,” I quipped. “Fresh eggs and the occasional rooster for dinner would be quite pleasant from what I’ve been told.” “Oh, and did you hear?” I mentioned later at the hotel. “Miss Beddingfeld is alive and well.” He nodded. “She certainly gave us all a scare,” I added nonchalantly.",1
"I watched as horror overtook her expression, her once debonair demeanor now extinguished. She had ignored my advice, and now faced the consequences. I was uncharacteristically ruthless towards her. She needed to face the truth. Turning the body over gently, I pointed out, ""He was stabbed in the back."" Her response was barely audible. ""With what?"" I gestured towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Without warning, she staggered and collapsed. I rushed to her side. ""You're faint. Let's get you out of here. This has all been too much for you."" ""Water,"" she whispered.",1
"In a flash Poirot sprang up. “Hastings, quick! Let’s follow him.” We discreetly trailed our target through the winding streets of Merlinville. However, Poirot halted as soon as he noticed the man heading towards the station. “Everything is going according to plan. He fell for the trap. He will head to Abbalac, seeking the non-existent valise left by the supposed foreigners. Ah, my friend, it was all a fabrication of mine.” “So you wanted him out of the picture!” I gasped. “Your insight is truly remarkable, Hastings! Now, shall we proceed to the Villa Geneviève?”",1
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Johnson, a renowned archaeologist specializing in ancient civilizations.""",1
"""Don't fear me, Bella. Please, don't fear me. I do love you, that's the truth, but I don't expect anything in return. Just allow me to assist you. If you must, continue to love him, but let me be there for you in ways he cannot."" Her reaction was as if she had been petrified by my words. Looking up from her hands, she gazed at me. ""You really believe that?"" she murmured. ""You truly believe that I care for Jack Renauld?"" Then, with a mixture of laughter and tears, she embraced me tightly, burying her face against mine. ""Not in the way I love you,"" she whispered.",1
"""The concept of suicide is no longer a concern. However, if she manages to quiet Madame Renauld by force, escape using her silk ladder while we distract the further door, and return to Villa Marguerite before we do, it will be difficult to incriminate her. Hercule Poirot did not outsmart her, but rather she was outplayed by the petite acrobat with her strong wrists."" Reflecting on the situation, I questioned Poirot, ""When did you first suspect Marthe Daubreuil? Was it when she claimed to have overheard the argument in the garden?"" Poirot responded with a smile.",1
"Renauld's smile faded as she shook her head at M. Hautet. ""There's nothing romantic about it, I assure you,"" she said. M. Hautet nodded in agreement. ""Let's not get carried away with melodrama. But there is something else,"" he added, pausing for a moment. Before he could continue, Stonor interrupted eagerly, ""It's unbelievable, Mrs. Renauld. They think Mr. Renauld was involved with a Madame Daubreuil who lives next door."" Mrs. Renauld blushed deeply, her expression changing rapidly. Stonor watched her, surprised by her reaction, while M. Hautet remained silent.",1
"""I suggest you adjust your attitude, young lady."" I remained silent, letting out a small yawn that hinted at my boredom. ""What the heck,"" he started forcefully. But I cut him off. ""Yelling won't get you anywhere with me. Let's not waste time. I have no interest in speaking with subordinates. Take me directly to Sir Eustace Pedler to save us both time and trouble."" ""To?"" He seemed bewildered. ""Yes,"" I confirmed. ""Sir Eustace Pedler."" ""I I beg your pardon,"" He hurried out of the room like a startled hare. I took the opportunity to touch up my makeup in my purse.",1
"As we approached the excavation site, a man with a grey beard, dressed in white and a helmet, approached us. ""Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We got your message. I apologize for the absence of a welcoming party in Cairo. A sudden turn of events messed up our plans."" Poirot's face lost color. His hand reached for his clothes-brush but halted. ""Another fatality?"" he whispered. ""Indeed."" ""Sir Guy Willard?"" I asked. ""No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider."" ""And the reason?"" Poirot inquired. ""Tetanus."" I felt my blood drain from my face.",1
"Chichester and Mr. Pagett. ""You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that sailors are the nicest to women. My purser came to the rescue magnificently. He confidently approached, clarified that No. 17 was my cabin, and offered them Nos. 13 and 28 or the option to stay put. I expressed my gratitude with a glance and settled into my new quarters. The incident lifted my spirits. The sea was calm, the temperature rising. Seasickness was a thing of the past! I ventured onto the deck and learned the game of deck-quoits. I signed up for various sports events.",1
"I pondered whether the killer had left any footprints the day before. The authorities would probably not divulge this information, but I doubted it. The climate had been pleasant and arid. The space itself was unremarkable. A nearly square shape with two large bay windows, simple white walls, and a bare wooden floor, the perimeter of which was marked by the absence of a carpet. I meticulously examined the area, yet there was not even a single object left behind. The brilliant young investigator appeared unlikely to stumble upon an overlooked piece of evidence.",1
"Poirot carefully surveyed the room, running his hand over the furniture and inspecting the cleanliness with approval. Suddenly, he straightened a crooked hearth-rug and discovered a small piece of paper hidden beneath it. Upon closer examination, it was revealed to be a torn fragment of a cheque, signed by M. Renauld to someone named Duveen. The commissary, flustered by his oversight, quickly turned to Madame Renauld for answers. With a renewed sense of determination, they left the room, leaving behind the mystery of the unexpected guest from the night before.",1
"Poirot examined the spade and gloves that belonged to Renauld, the victim of the crime. He noted the attention to detail in the planning of the murder, with the killer using Renauld's own dagger and spade to avoid leaving traces. Giraud, the Paris detective, was focused on the ground while Poirot took interest in a piece of lead-piping nearby. Despite Giraud's dismissal, Poirot found it intriguing. As they continued their investigation, Poirot questioned the significance of a whitewashed line around the grave, revealing his unique approach to solving the case.",1
"She placed her small hand gently in mine. ""Please, be a dear,"" she whispered. Reluctantly, I agreed. Deep down, I knew that I might actually enjoy playing the role of a showman. The girl's moral stance was not my concern. Despite some nerves about the examining magistrate's reaction, I consoled myself with the thought that no real harm could come of this. Our first stop was the location where the body was found. A guard stood watch, offering a respectful salute upon seeing me, without questioning my companion. Evidently, he assumed she was under my protection.",1
"""The revelation of the possible love affair between Madame Daubreuil and Mr. Renauld left Mrs. Renauld in a state of anguish. Stonor, shocked by this revelation, stood there with a blank expression on his face. The door suddenly burst open, and a young man, with a striking resemblance to the deceased Mr. Renauld, entered the room. The uncanny resemblance caused a stir among the assembled group, but it soon became apparent that this was a mere boy, untouched by the grey hairs of age, who had entered with an impetuousness that disregarded all norms of decorum.""",1
"""The short man grabbed me, shoved a gag in my mouth, and tied me up with rope. Meanwhile, the other man menaced my husband with a dagger. They dragged him into the dressing-room, speaking in a foreign language. They demanded something from him, grew angry, and searched for keys. They found money, but not what they wanted. Eventually, they forced my husband to dress and took him away. There was no other exit from the room. My husband reassured me before they left, but I could see the fear in his eyes. I must have fainted, and when I came to, Léonie was there.""",1
"As we raced against time to outsmart the cunning Andrew Marsh, our efforts proved futile and his niece remained in peril. Rushing to the station, we managed to board a train bound for London, albeit not the fastest one. Poirot appeared dejected, while I struggled to stay awake in my seat. Suddenly, near Taunton, Poirot let out a sharp cry. ""Quick, Hastings! Wake up and jump! Jump, I tell you!"" In a daze, we found ourselves on the platform, without our belongings, watching the train vanish into the darkness. Anger boiled inside me, but Poirot remained unfazed.",1
"It was clear that Madame Beroldy was involved in a complicated web of lies and deceit, leading to a shocking murder. Despite her initial acquittal, the truth eventually came to light. Madame Beroldy's manipulative nature and hidden motives were finally exposed, revealing a dark and twisted tale of betrayal and revenge. The case was a tangled web of secrets and lies, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. The shocking revelation of Madame Beroldy's true intentions left everyone stunned, proving that sometimes the most innocent-looking faces hide the darkest hearts.",1
"Poirot raised an eyebrow. ""You're missing the key detail here,"" he said, leaning back in his chair with a thoughtful expression. ""Lowen couldn't have been the one to force the safe, it's too obvious. The grudge against Davenheim is a red herring, a distraction from the real motive."" I glanced at him, puzzled. ""Then who do you think did it?"" Poirot smiled mysteriously. ""Ah, that is the question, isn't it? The answer lies in the details that everyone else overlooks."" And with that enigmatic statement, he got up and left the room, leaving me to ponder his words.",1
"” I tried to follow his instructions, reviewing every aspect of the investigation. After careful consideration, it became apparent to me that Giraud's theory, which Poirot dismissed, was the most logical explanation. Contemplating further, I realized that the key to the puzzle likely lay with Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was unaware of her involvement in the Beroldy Case, a detail Poirot emphasized as crucial. Focused on this new lead, I felt a surge of hope. Then, a sudden burst of inspiration struck me, causing me to tremble as I pieced together a new theory.""",1
"""But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I exclaimed. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, right?” “Yes, sir, but…” Poirot leaned in. “But what?” “M. Renauld was murdered this morning.” Poirot swiftly exited the car, his eyes filled with intensity. He grabbed the man by the shoulder. “What did you say? Murdered? When? How?” The police officer stood firm. “I cannot provide any answers, sir.” “Understood. I see.” Poirot pondered for a moment. “The Police Commissioner, he is inside?” “Yes, sir.” Poirot handed over a card, quickly jotting down a few words on it.",1
"""I kept a low profile, biding my time before seizing an opportunity. Luck finally intervened when I eavesdropped on a chat between two older men in the neighborhood, one of whom turned out to be Sir Eustace Pedler. That moment sparked an idea - I decided to insinuate myself into his circle as his personal assistant. The snippet of their conversation provided a vital clue. Doubt began to creep in regarding Sir Eustace Pedler's true identity as the 'Colonel.' Perhaps his residence was chosen as a meeting point by chance, or for a hidden agenda that eluded me.""",1
"""I wanted to ask how you knew about those two?"" ""My friend, I understand human nature. When you combine a young boy like Renauld with a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, the outcome is almost certain. And then, the argument! It was either money or a woman, and recalling Léonie's account of the boy's rage, I deduced the latter. So I took a chance and I was correct."" ""So that's why you cautioned me against falling for the lady? You already suspected that she had feelings for young Renauld?"" Poirot grinned. ""At least I noticed that she had worried eyes.""",1
"""I was just starting to relax when Suzanne abruptly asked: “What's the opposite?” “The opposite of what?” I replied. “There has to be an opposite. What's the term for skulls that are more than 75% as wide as they are long?” “Brachycephalic,” I reluctantly admitted. “Ah, that's right. I thought I heard you say that.” “Did I? Must have misspoke. I meant dolichocephalic,” I confidently stated. Suzanne stared at me intently. Then she burst out laughing. “You're a good liar, Gipsy girl. But let's cut to the chase, tell me everything now to save time and trouble.”",1
"""Looking down at the body, he furrowed his brow. ""Would you classify this individual as Spanish?"" he inquired abruptly. Studying the features intently, I finally replied, ""No, without a doubt I would identify him as French."" Giraud expressed his dissatisfaction with a grunt. ""I concur."" After a brief pause, he motioned for me to step aside with authority and resumed his meticulous search of the shed floor on all fours. His attention to detail was exceptional. Methodically, he combed through every inch of the area, scrutinizing pots and inspecting old sacks.""",1
"""Oh, those English! Our ways are quite different. Let me tell you about a woman I knew who, at the start of the war, sought refuge in Ostend. There, she was gripped by a severe bout of nerves. Trapped with the enemy closing in, her only escape route was across the sea. But she had an absolute horror, mais une horreur! of the sea. Can you picture the dire circumstances she found herself in?"" ""And what did she do?"" I asked, my curiosity piqued. ""Luckily, her husband was a practical man. He remained remarkably composed, unaffected by her nerve-wracking crises.""",1
"Diamonds had been discovered in the vicinity of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers in the past, but John Eardsley and Lucas made a groundbreaking find of extensive carbon deposits at the confluence of two rivers. The diamonds they unearthed displayed a wide array of colors - pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and pristine white. Eardsley and Lucas traveled to Kimberley to have their precious gems evaluated, coinciding with a shocking heist at the De Beers establishment. Whenever diamonds are shipped to England, they are carefully packaged into a secure parcel.",1
"I observed him carefully, noting his official demeanor as a high-ranking member of the Secret Service. It was evident that he was on a mission to apprehend the elusive figure known as the ""Colonel."" As I pieced together the puzzle in my mind, it became increasingly apparent to me. But where did I fit into this intricate web of deceit and treachery? Were the valuable diamonds the sole motivation behind the relentless pursuit to eliminate me? I could not bring myself to believe it. There was something more at play here, something far greater than a mere heist.",1
"The night of the Fancy Dress ball was a turning point for me. I pondered over whom to confide in, feeling a sudden loneliness and vulnerability. Colonel Race seemed kind and intelligent, but too commanding for my liking. Mrs. Blair, on the other hand, was approachable and experienced in life's ways. I made up my mind to seek her out immediately. After learning her cabin number, I headed to Mrs. Blair's cabin, where she welcomed me in her stunning kimono. I opened up to her about my life story, expecting a certain reaction but receiving a surprising response.",1
"“I must say, that looks like hair,” I observed with a grimace. “It is indeed hair. A toupee, I presume,” “Exactly,” I responded. “Does this finally convince you that Mrs. Pettigrew is actually a man in disguise?” “Absolutely, Pagett. Those feet of hers were a dead giveaway.” “Well then, it’s settled. Now, Sir Eustace, I need to discuss some personal matters with you. Your subtle hints about my time in Florence have not gone unnoticed.” Finally, the truth about Pagett's time in Florence is about to come to light. “Just come clean, my friend,” I urged gently.",1
"But, at that moment, where was Poirot? I watched him closely. He projected an air of innocence, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. His calm demeanor seemed too serene and relaxed to offer any comfort. Through my experience with Poirot, I had come to realize that the more harmless he appeared, the more dangerous he actually was. His tranquility unsettled me. Sensing my unease, he smiled kindly. ""You seem perplexed, Hastings? Wondering why I haven't taken action?"" ""Something along those lines."" ""That's what you would do if you were in my shoes. I get it.""",1
"I approached the counter, my voice steady this time. ""Kilmorden Castle?"" I inquired. The attendant informed me that the ship was departing on the 17th from Southampton to Cape Town. ""First or second class?"" he asked. Without hesitation, I asked about the cost. ""First class, eighty-seven pounds,"" he replied. The exact amount of my inheritance! I made up my mind. ""First class,"" I confirmed, sealing my fate. The adventure awaited me. (Excerpts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)It's curious how peace always eludes me. I am a man who craves tranquility.",1
"We must act quickly if we hope to catch the culprit,"" the manager declared, swiftly producing the key. Without hesitation, we made our way into the apartment. Our first stop was a compact square lounge. A partially open door on the right caught the manager's attention. ""The dining area,"" he muttered, gesturing towards it. Dr. Hawker took the lead, with us close behind. Stepping into the room, I couldn't help but gasp. The table at the center still held the remnants of a meal, while three chairs were pushed away, as if their occupants had only just departed.",1
"When Havering walked into the hall, his wife hurried towards him with an apology. Left alone, my investigation proved to be underwhelming. Unlike the abundance of clues in detective novels, I found nothing out of the ordinary except for a significant bloodstain on the carpet where the deceased seemed to have collapsed. Despite my meticulous examination and a few snapshots taken with my trusty camera, the scene offered little insight. The trampled ground outside the window seemed futile to explore further, as it had clearly been disturbed beyond recognition.",1
"“Good Lord! You have a heart that is easily swayed!” “Hastings,” I said, “do you recall the aftermath of the Styles Case when ” “When you were entangled with feelings for two delightful women simultaneously, yet neither reciprocated? Yes, I recall.” “You comforted me by suggesting that one day we would collaborate on a case once more, and that then ” “And then?” “Here we are, collaborating again, and ” I hesitated, chuckling somewhat awkwardly. To my astonishment, Poirot vehemently shook his head. “Ah, my friend, do not become attached to Marthe Daubreuil.",1
"""I see it as the most effective approach."" ""Appreciate it, Sir Eustace."" ""Could it be her spouse? Husbands can be quite bothersome. They always appear at the most inconvenient times."" ""I am confused, Sir Eustace. Whose spouse are you referring to?"" ""The woman's spouse."" ""Which woman?"" ""Heavens, Pagett, the woman from your encounter in Florence. Surely there was a woman involved. You can't tell me you only burglarized a church or attacked an Italian because you didn't like his appearance."" ""I am completely bewildered, Sir Eustace. I assume you are jesting.""",1
"""Renauld. This case has been one of the most perplexing and baffling mysteries to crack. Someone like Giraud, who doesn't rely on psychology, is bound to come up short."" ""You're truly amazing, Poirot,"" I expressed with awe. ""Absolutely amazing. No one else could have pulled it off like you did!""I could tell my admiration made him happy. For once, he seemed almost bashful. ""So, you no longer look down on poor old Papa Poirot? You're back to supporting me instead of the human foxhound?"" His nickname for Giraud always brought a smile to my face. ""Absolutely.""",1
"""Sir Eustace, the situation is rather suspicious in my opinion. Just consider my illness before our journey,"" Pagett remarked. Interrupting sharply, I stated, ""Your illness was simply a bout of indigestion. You are prone to such episodes."" Pagett looked uneasy. ""This was different. I suspect foul play."" ""Please spare me the details of your ailment, Pagett. I have no interest in hearing them,"" I replied. ""Very well, Sir Eustace. But I am convinced that I was intentionally poisoned!"" ""Ah,"" I mused. ""You've been influenced by Rayburn."" Pagett remained silent.",1
"I adored Falls, a place I cherished deeply. After dinner, Sir Eustace secluded himself with Miss Pettigrew. A mysterious note from Harry Rayburn urged me to the palm gully clearing. Hesitating, I set out, wary of being followed. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows and chased me. Panicked, I tripped and fell into darkness. Awakening in a strange room, I found Harry Rayburn sitting beside me. Grateful for his presence, I wept with relief. His comforting words and a cup of milk eased my fears. As I drifted back to sleep, I knew I was safe in his care.",1
"I noticed it as we ascended the staircase of the tall building in a serene Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me with a friendly demeanor. She appeared to be a sturdy, calm woman of the ""ideal wife and mother"" category. Showing me to a pristine bedroom adorned with chintz, she assured me that tea would be served shortly and then departed, leaving me alone. Her voice, slightly elevated, drifted from the drawing-room below on the first level. ""Well, Henry, what in the world"" I couldn't make out the rest, but the sharpness of the tone was unmistakable.",1
"Poirot sat calmly, reading his letters. One was a request for a lecture, another an invitation from the Countess of Forfanock, and the last a mysterious letter from France. The urgent plea for help intrigued Poirot, prompting him to make hasty travel plans to meet the desperate writer. The letter hinted at danger and a secret that could cost a man his life. Poirot, sensing the gravity of the situation, wasted no time in preparing for the journey to France. He and his companion set off on the Continental express, eager to unravel the mystery that lay ahead.",1
"The Kafir boy opened the door, gesturing for me to come in. Hesitating, I lingered in the dimly lit hall. Without a word, the man led me to another room. ""The young lady here to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,"" he announced with a chuckle. I entered. The room was bare, the air thick with the smell of stale tobacco. A man sat at a desk, scribbling away. He glanced up, surprised. ""Well, well, if it isn't Miss Beddingfeld,"" he remarked. ""I must be mistaken,"" I stammered. ""Are you Mr. Chichester, or perhaps Miss Pettigrew? You bear a striking resemblance to them both.""",1
"""Indeed,"" Poirot remarked with a hint of disdain. ""Even in Santiago, they possess that knowledge. Even the most inexperienced English Miss is aware of it, thanks to the extensive publicity the Bertillon system has received in the media. Nevertheless, the absence of finger-prints intrigues me greatly. It is astonishingly simple to plant another person's prints. And the authorities are satisfied."" He sighed. ""I suspect our culprit lacks a systematic approach, or perhaps was rushed. Time will tell."" With that, he gently returned the body to its initial pose.",1
"As Sir Eustace paused mid-sentence, Miss Pettigrew, though efficient in appearance, startled at his sudden halt. “God bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “What of the man in Durban?” “I choose you,” I murmured. “My dear,” Sir Eustace whispered. “You may hold my hand now.” At once, Miss Pettigrew cleared her throat, causing Sir Eustace to retract his hand abruptly. “Ah, yes,” he continued. “Where were we? Ah, yes. Tylman Roos, during his speech...Why are you not jotting this down?” Colonel Race interjected gently, “I believe Miss Pettigrew's pencil has snapped.”",1
"I realized the enormity of the task I had set for Poirot. It would not be easy to secure Jack Renauld's acquittal. M. Hautet suggested that Madame Renauld may have been mistaken about the dagger, insinuating Jack's guilt. Jack's response only fueled further suspicion, leading to his inevitable condemnation by M. Hautet. Just as all hope seemed lost, a mysterious figure named Bella Duveen appeared, confessing to the murder of Mr. Renauld. Bella's confession shed light on the events leading up to the crime, revealing a tangled web of deceit and desperation.",1
"No wonder she fainted! Despite her grief and despair, she has resolutely played her part. The anguish must be unbearable. She remains silent, refusing to reveal the true identity of the real murderers. To protect her son, she conceals the fact that Paul Renauld was actually Georges Conneau, the criminal. In a final bitter blow, she publicly admits that Madame Daubreuil was her husband's mistress, risking blackmail to keep her secret safe. She skillfully navigates the questions of the examining magistrate regarding any mysteries in her husband's past life.",1
"""Anne, do you recall telling me that women often do things they dislike for someone they care about?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, curious about his intentions. He embraced me tightly. ""Anne, run away with me tonight. Let's go back to Rhodesia, back to the island. I can't endure all this foolishness any longer. I can't keep waiting for you."" I pulled away for a moment. ""And what about my collection of French dresses?"" I lamented in a playful tone. Harry still struggles to differentiate when I am serious and when I am simply teasing him. ""Forget your French dresses.",1
"""He smiled softly. ""I did not drink it,"" he said. While his friend Hastings rambled on, he seized the chance to pour the liquid into a small vial instead of swallowing it. That vial was on its way to the chemist for analysis. The doctor attempted to grab it, but he quickly realized that force would not work. In the short time that Hastings left to get the doctor, he had hidden the vial. ""Quick, Hastings, stop him!"" I mistakenly thought Poirot was worried about his friend and jumped in front of him. But the doctor's sudden action had a different purpose.""",1
"""I might as well be dead and done with it."" ""I appreciate the favor. There's no escaping it. I saved your life and I expect some gratitude."" If glares could kill, he would have murdered me on the spot. He shoved past me aggressively. Pausing at the door, he looked back and spoke dismissively. ""I won't thank you now or ever. But I won't forget the favor. One day, I'll repay it."" With that, he disappeared, leaving me with clenched fists and a racing heart. The rest of the night was uneventful. The next morning, I had breakfast in bed and woke up late. Mrs.",1
"""I've taken care of everything. Is Mrs. Blair bringing a maid?"" ""Mrs. Blair?"" I exclaimed. ""She said you offered her a spot."" I must have, that one night. I even encouraged her to join. Never expected her to actually come though! Lovely as she is, I'm not sure I want to spend the entire trip to Rhodesia and back with Mrs. Blair. Women need so much attention. And they can be quite a bother at times. ""Did I invite anyone else?"" I asked anxiously. These things happen in moments of excitement. ""Mrs. Blair thought you had also invited Colonel Race."" I sighed.",1
"""So we have come to the conclusion that Madame Renauld fabricated the truth out of love for a man, specifically Georges Conneau. Do you agree with this assessment?"" ""Yes,"" I confessed. ""It does make sense."" ""Good! Madame Renauld's affection lies with Georges Conneau. But who is Georges Conneau?"" ""The vagrant."" ""Do we have any proof that Madame Renauld cared for the vagrant?"" ""No, but..."" ""In that case, let go of theories that lack evidence. Instead, consider who Madame Renauld truly loved."" I shook my head in confusion. ""But of course, you already know.""",1
"“What reason would he have to do that? Especially with criminals and killers roaming the streets every minute! Ridiculous! The man was not foolish. It’s not like he had to release that woman.” The judge interjected abruptly: “That woman? Which lady are you referring to?” “Why, the woman who visited him.” “A woman had visited him that night?” “Of course, sir, and on many other nights too.” “Who was she? Were you acquainted with her?” A sly expression crossed the woman’s face. “How would I know who she was?” she grumbled. “I didn’t let her in last evening.",1
"“Your Honor,” I began, feeling a weight of guilt on my shoulders, “I must confess to a serious misstep that I deeply regret.” “Please, go on,” the judge urged. “I encountered a young woman, a friend of mine, who expressed a strong curiosity to explore every corner of the crime scene. Against my better judgment, I gave her access to the restricted area,” I admitted. The magistrate's expression hardened. “This is a grave error, Detective Reynolds. Your actions were reckless and completely out of line. Such behavior cannot be tolerated in our line of work.”",1
"Honestly, I despise early humans, whether they be Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or any other kind. Despite working on Papa's book about Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors, I can't help but feel repulsed by Neanderthal men themselves. It's a relief that they went extinct so long ago. I doubt Papa ever realized my true feelings, and even if he did, he wouldn't have cared. He was never concerned with the opinions of others, which I believe was a testament to his greatness. Similarly, he lived completely removed from the mundane aspects of everyday life.",1
"I approached Pagett on the platform, eager to speak with him. He seemed startled by my presence, his usual nervous demeanor even more pronounced this time. ""Miss Beddingfeld, I thought you had vanished,"" he exclaimed. The train had arrived just ten minutes behind schedule, with everyone hastily disembarking and pacing back and forth. The hotel porter had mentioned that the train's journey to Johannesburg was going smoothly today, despite doubts due to a recent explosion along the line. It was a surprisingly cheerful notion, considering the circumstances.",1
"I positioned myself on the floor, mimicking the posture of the deceased. Placing a cushion in my place, I painstakingly recreated the movements and actions of the physician from memory. Completing the task, I achieved my objective. Leaning back, I scowled at the walls before me. An article in the evening news mentioned a suspicious death in the subway, raising questions of intent versus happenstance. The course of action became evident to me, and Mr. Flemming concurred upon hearing my account. ""You will undoubtedly be summoned to testify at the inquiry.""",1
"I waited anxiously, but no one appeared. There was no sign of being trailed. I proceeded toward the open space, counting my steps. After six paces, I halted abruptly. A noise came from behind me, not from anyone tailing me, but from someone already present, lurking. Suddenly, a feeling of impending danger washed over me, an instinctual alarm similar to what I experienced on the Kilmorden that fateful evening. I quickly glanced back, only to be met with silence. Continuing forward, the rustle sounded once more. Persisting on my path, I glanced back again.",1
"Poirot revealed the shocking truth to Jack Renauld about his father's past, leading Jack to make a life-changing decision. Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother and secretary, leaving behind a girl who loves him dearly. Poirot encouraged Jack to be honest with the girl and let her decide. Despite his doubts, Jack realized that true love conquers all and decided to pursue a future with her. As for Captain Hastings, his future plans remain uncertain, but the story ends with a light-hearted moment between him and a familiar face.",1

My behavior last night was completely uncalled for.” “It was quite an unusual evening,” I replied quickly. It wasn't the most coherent response, but it was all I could muster. “Can you find it in yourself to forgive me?” I extended my hand silently. He accepted it. “There is another matter I need to address.” His expression grew more serious.""",1
"""Here you go! Please deliver this card to the commissary right away,"" she said, handing the man the message. He took it and, beckoning to his colleague, whistled. Within moments, another man arrived and received the card from her. After a brief wait, a stout man with a large moustache hurried over to the gate. The officer saluted and stepped aside. ""Ah, my dear detective,"" exclaimed the newcomer, ""I'm so glad you're here. Your timing couldn't be better."" The detective's face lit up. ""Mr. Smith! What a pleasant surprise."" He then glanced in my direction.",1
"""I don't know,"" I murmured. ""I have this uneasy feeling that something terrible is on the horizon."" Suzanne shook her head firmly. ""Ridiculous,"" she scoffed. ""Let's shift our focus. Anne, those jewels..."" ""What of them?"" I inquired. ""I fear they may not be secure in my possession any longer. Previously, it was inconspicuous, but now that our close relationship is common knowledge, I may come under scrutiny."" ""But no one suspects they're concealed within a roll of film,"" I countered. ""It's a brilliant hiding spot, and I doubt we could find a better one.""",1
"He walked past us without acknowledging our presence, his lean, bronzed face hinting at a life spent in tropical regions. Poirot quickly approached a gardener for information about the man, who had stayed at the house the previous week. Mrs. Maltravers was shocked to see him, as he had cancelled his trip to East Africa due to unexpected news of inheritance. Poirot suspected foul play and engaged in a subtle interrogation to uncover the truth. As the mystery unfolded, it became clear that appearances could be deceiving and things were not as they seemed.",1
"“Believe it or not, I had a dream where we stumbled upon Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and you accused her of killing Mr. Renauld,” I said. “That wasn’t a dream. It actually happened,” Poirot confirmed.“But Bella Duveen confessed to the murder, didn’t she?” “No, my dear Hastings, she did not. She took the blame to protect her lover from the death penalty.”“What?” “Think back to Jack Renauld’s account. They both arrived at the crime scene simultaneously, each mistaking the other for the killer. The girl, horrified, fled with a scream.”",1
"""But who was he?"" Poirot asked. ""The man with the duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who miraculously recovered from severe bronchitis. Yes, that 'stodgy' old man, Mr. Shaw! Sometimes, my friend, criminals lurk in high places. Ah, we have arrived. Mademoiselle, success is mine! May I?"" Poirot beamed as he lightly kissed the astonished girl on both cheeks. Among the many adventures shared with Poirot, one of the most thrilling and dramatic was our investigation into the mysterious deaths following the opening of King Men-her-Ra's Tomb.",1
"“But, my goodness! What will happen to Bella?” “If I were in your shoes,” Poirot advised, “I wouldn't worry too much. The French legal system tends to be forgiving towards young and beautiful individuals involved in crimes of passion. A skilled attorney could argue for mitigating circumstances. It won't be easy for you” “I'm not concerned about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a sense I do feel responsible for my father's death. If not for me and my relationship with this woman, he would still be alive. And then my foolish mistake in taking the wrong coat.",1
"“Who was it that Madame Renauld loved so deeply that upon discovering his lifeless body, she succumbed to a faint?” I was taken aback. “Her spouse?” I uttered. Poirot confirmed. “Her spouse, or Georges Conneau, as you wish to refer to him.” I composed myself. “But that seems highly unlikely.” “Why so ‘unlikely?’ Did we not just establish that Madame Daubreuil had leverage over Georges Conneau?” “Indeed, but” “And did she not successfully use that leverage against Mr. Renauld?” “That may be the case, however” “And do we not lack any information about M.",1
"Jack rushed to catch his train in Paris after a heated argument. Léonie, who witnessed his departure, couldn't understand the cause of the dispute due to the language barrier. Poirot decided to wait in the salon while I went to investigate Giraud's activities. As I made my way through the shrubbery, I unexpectedly collided with a young lady, who turned out to be Cinderella. She confessed to being intrigued by the murder at Villa Geneviève and begged me to show her the crime scene. Shocked by her morbid curiosity, I hesitated, unsure of what to do next.",1
"Renauld plans to disguise himself as a tramp, making his escape from the station on the 12:10 train without raising any suspicion. The unexpected arrival of Bella threatens to derail his carefully orchestrated scheme, forcing him to act quickly to eliminate her interference. With every passing moment crucial to the success of his plan, Renauld wastes no time in dispatching Bella and setting in motion the next phase of his deadly plot. Leaving the front door slightly open, he skillfully manipulates the scene to divert attention from his true intentions.",1
"""But what if it wasn't her sister's dagger, but the one Jack gave to Marthe Daubreuil? If that were the case, Bella Duveen's dagger would remain untouched! I didn't say a word to you, Hastings (there was no time for romance). Instead, I found Mademoiselle Dulcie and disclosed what was necessary, instructing her to search through her sister's belongings. My excitement soared when she came to me (following my directions) as Miss Robinson, holding the precious memento! Meanwhile, I had already taken actions to lure Mademoiselle Marthe out into the open.""",1

Poirot's questions pierced through my soul, revealing a tangled web of deceit and betrayal. And as the truth slowly emerged, I found myself on my knees, begging for salvation.""",1
"As I looked around, a sense of malevolence hung in the air. The chilling possibility crossed my mind - could I be the next target? Poirot whispered softly, ""Mon Dieu, this is beyond comprehension. It's terrifying. Please, sir, was it definitely tetanus?"" ""I don't think so. Dr. Ames will have more information,"" I replied. ""Ah, you're not the physician then."" ""No, I'm Tosswill."" Lady Willard's British specialist, a man named Tosswill from the British Museum, emitted an aura of seriousness and determination that intrigued me. ""Follow me,"" Dr. Ames urged.",1
"The man tending to the garden was clearly agitated by our presence, but begrudgingly agreed to assist us. After an unbearable delay, he presented us with some stale pastries and lukewarm tea before retreating back to his gardening. As soon as he left, a swarm of hungry cats surrounded us, meowing incessantly. Feeling sorry for the starving creatures, I offered them bits of cake which they devoured eagerly. Pouring what little milk we had into a saucer caused the cats to fight over it ferociously. ""They're clearly malnourished!"" I exclaimed in outrage.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, the inhabitants fast asleep. As we stood below Mrs. Renauld’s open window, a cry for help pierced the night. Poirot sprang into action, rushing to the front door, then scaling a tree with feline grace to enter through the window. The scene inside was chaotic, with Mrs. Renauld barely clinging to life. The true culprit, Marthe Daubreuil, lay dead on the ground, a victim of her own twisted plot.

Expected the eyes to draw attention, so he took a bold approach to throw off suspicion. Must have shadowed you from the hotel and struck as soon as you were out of sight."" ""And what of the jewel case?"" I inquired. ""It was discovered in a hotel corridor.""",1
"""I remember the purser assuring me that cabin."" ""Pursers are always so preoccupied, don't you think?"" I replied vaguely. ""They're bound to overlook things from time to time."" Mr. Chichester remained silent. ""Is this your initial journey to Africa?"" I asked casually. ""To South Africa, yes. However, I've spent the past couple of years among the cannibal tribes in the heart of East Africa."" ""How exciting! Have you encountered many close calls?"" ""Close calls?"" ""Of being devoured, I mean?"" ""You shouldn't joke about such serious matters, Miss Beddingfeld.""",1
"""Look, here he comes pushing his wheelbarrow.” It was clear that an older gentleman was making his way across the driveway with a load of seedlings. Poirot signaled to him, causing the man to stop and shuffle towards us. “Are you planning to request one of his boots to compare against the footprints?” I inquired eagerly. My confidence in Poirot started to return. If he deemed the footprints in the right-hand bed significant, then they must be. “Precisely,” responded Poirot. “But wouldn’t he find it rather strange?” “He won’t give it a second thought.",1
"“There’s a certain cold precision in his manner that was missing from the real doctor. Plus, a doctor wouldn’t typically check for the heart on the right side of the chest.” “Are you saying he did that?” “Yes, I didn’t pick up on it right away, but I had a feeling something was off. It all clicked for me later when I got home.” “Interesting,” remarked the detective. He slowly pulled out a pen and paper. “By examining the upper body, he could easily have taken whatever he pleased from the pockets.” “I find that hard to believe,” the detective replied.",1
"""Why was she so shocked by the return of young Black once more? And despite the expectation for a woman to feign sorrow for her deceased husband, I find the heavily painted eyelids distasteful! Did you not notice them, Hastings? As I constantly remind you, you are oblivious to everything!"" ""So, here we are. The two potential scenarios present themselves. Did Black's account propose a clever scheme for suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did the wife, his other audience, perceive a similarly cunning plan for murder? My inclination leans towards the latter.""",1
"Efforts to locate the missing individual proved futile, despite Signor Ascanio's insistence on his innocence and lack of association with the victim. The Daily Newsmonger kept the public informed of the unfolding events surrounding the arrest of Signor Ascanio for the murder of Count Foscatini. Rumors swirled about the mysterious second man allegedly involved in the crime, but his whereabouts remained a mystery. Signor Ascanio's arrival at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent just two days prior to the murder only added to the intrigue of the case.",1
"I never suspected the extent of my own foolishness. I foolishly believed I had ample time before her arrival at the Villa. Mademoiselle Marthe was certainly cunning.” “Her goal was to kill Mrs. Renauld?” “Indeed. By doing so, the entire inheritance would go to her son. But it would have been a reckless move, my friend! Beside Marthe Daubreuil's lifeless body, I discovered a pad, a small bottle of chloroform, and a syringe filled with a lethal dose of morphine. Do you see? First the chloroform, then, once the victim is unconscious, the needle's prick.",1
"What was Poirot's true motive in searching for Bella Duveen? Was it related to the murder of Jack Renauld? The girl seemed to have no reason to wish for his death, but perhaps there was a deeper connection between them. Why did she keep returning to Merlinville? These questions circled in my mind as Poirot and I arrived in London, ready to uncover the truth. Time was of the essence, and Poirot was determined to act swiftly. Our next move was to seek out Joseph Aarons, a theatrical agent with connections that might lead us to the elusive Bella Duveen.",1
"... She couldn't bear to see him suffer! Would she be the one to seal his fate? Guilty of many things, but innocent of the crime they accused her of. Yet, her charm and charisma prevailed. In a whirlwind of emotions, Madame Beroldy was found not guilty. Despite the police's best efforts, Georges Conneau remained elusive. And as for Madame Beroldy, she vanished without a trace, taking the child with her to start anew. The Beroldy case, with all its intricacies, is now documented. Not every detail is crystal clear in my mind as I recollect the events.",1
"""Oh, every detail! The location of the incident, the murder weapon, the victim, any fingerprints or other intriguing evidence. I never imagined I would be so close to a murder investigation like this. Will this memory haunt me forever?"" I walked away, feeling disgusted. What had society come to, with women finding excitement in such gruesome events? The girl's morbid enthusiasm made me feel sick to my stomach. I had heard of the crowds of women gathering outside courtrooms during capital trials, but I never understood who these women were until now.",1
"“Tell me, did you let Madame Daubreuil into the house last night?” “No, sir, it was the night before.” “But Françoise just said Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, sir. A woman did visit Mr. Renauld last night, but it wasn't Madame Daubreuil.” The magistrate pressed further, but the girl was adamant. She was positive it wasn't Madame Daubreuil. This woman was dark, but shorter and much younger. Her identification was unwavering. “Had you ever seen her before?” “Never, sir.” Then, the girl hesitated and added: “But I believe she was English.”",1
"""The master detective has not failed us yet,"" Hawker remarked, patting him on the back. ""There is always something to ponder."" ""Indeed, there is,"" he replied. ""Take, for instance, the door."" ""The door? But it was locked. No one could have entered or exited through it. I made sure of it."" ""And why were you so certain?"" The doctor appeared confused. Poirot quickly clarified. ""I am referring to the keyhole. It was not covered. Quite peculiar. And then there was the tea. It was exceptionally bitter."" ""So what?"" ""Exceptionally bitter,"" Poirot emphasized.",1
"As the morning sun rose, a startling piece of news arrived in the form of a telegram. It was a plea for help, urging immediate action in the wake of a tragic event. Without hesitation, we embarked on a journey to a remote location, guided by the grim reality of a murder that had taken place the night before. The desolate surroundings only added to the mystery and sense of foreboding that hung in the air. Despite the uncertainty and lack of details, one thing was clear - the need for a skilled detective to unravel the truth behind this heinous crime.",1
"However, despite the gossip, there were many who claimed that young Conneau was not the only one who held Madame Beroldy's affections. Approximately three months after the Beroldys arrived in Paris, another notable figure entered the picture. Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a wealthy American, found himself captivated by the charming and enigmatic Madame Beroldy. His admiration for her was clear, yet always maintained a sense of respect. As time passed, Madame Beroldy began to confide in a few close friends, expressing her concerns for her husband's well-being.",1
"I have never witnessed a man in such distress. The situation is truly bizarre. Where could the young woman have disappeared to? She left the hotel at eleven-ten, fully clothed, and vanished without a trace. Suicide is out of the question; she was a vibrant soul with a deep love for life. With no trains departing until noon the next day, she couldn't have left town. So, where on earth is she? Race, her partner, is frantic. He has done everything in his power to find her. Law enforcement officers from all over the region have been called in to assist.",1
"In a single cunning move, the blackmailed individual not only eliminated the blackmailer, but also cleverly framed another unsuspecting victim for the crime. The unmistakable mark of the notorious 'Colonel' was evident in the scheme. Once again, I found myself ensnared in his web of deception. How foolish I was to have fallen into the trap so effortlessly. Disoriented, I exited the scene, trying to maintain a facade of composure, knowing that it was only a matter of time before the truth would surface and my identity would be broadcast far and wide.",1
"The room was adorned with curtains and portière in a muted green hue, perfectly complemented by the matching carpet. Poirot carefully surveyed the space, running his hand over the leather chairs, inspecting the magazine on the table, and lightly touching the oak sideboard. A look of satisfaction crossed his face. ""No dust?"" I teased. He smiled warmly, acknowledging my understanding of his preferences. ""Not a speck, my friend! Though, perhaps, a bit unfortunate this time."" His keen eyes scanned the room before he exclaimed, ""Ah!"" in a tone of relief.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, everyone fast asleep. Poirot's eyes focused on the open window of Mrs. Renauld's bedroom. A cry for help pierced the silence, followed by a struggle in the room. Poirot sprang into action, trying to break down the locked door. Meanwhile, Cinderella, the acrobat, swung from the roof to save the day. The mystery unraveled as Marthe Daubreuil's lifeless body was discovered, revealing the truth behind Mr. Renauld's murder. Poirot's keen observations and deductions ultimately led to the unravelling of the complex case.",1
"""As an example, on the night he attempted to push me off the ship, the Kilmorden, he claims that he followed Rayburn onto the deck and got knocked down by Rayburn. We now understand that this is false."" ""Yes,"" Suzanne admitted reluctantly. ""But we only received the account indirectly from Sir Eustace. If we had heard it directly from Pagett himself, the narrative might have been altered. People tend to distort a story slightly when they pass it on."" I pondered the situation. ""No,"" I finally replied, ""I can't find a way around it. Pagett is guilty.""",1
"""Lord Estair, I can only tell you that if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I would have laughed in his face,"" Monsieur Poirot said, keenly observing. ""And today?"" ""Today, I do not know what to think,"" Lord Estair replied, gesturing in despair. Poirot nodded solemnly, glancing at his watch. ""I must have carte blanche, messieurs, in every way. I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose."" ""Absolutely. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard.""",1
"""Why was the Mill House chosen as the murder scene? Could Pagett have been made a scapegoat for the stolen diamonds in Kimberley if I had not intervened? Do you think he is innocent?"" ""It seems that way, but we need to uncover his activities in Marlow. If he can explain that, we might be on the right track."" Standing up, he said, ""It's late. Get some rest, Anne. I'll take you to the boat just before dawn. You need to catch the train in Livingstone. A friend will keep you safe until it's time to leave. Head to Bulawayo and catch the train to Beira.""",1
"""Yet the letter from Mr. Renauld? It clearly alludes to a hidden truth involving Santiago?"" ""Certainly, a concealed aspect of M. Renauld's past seems evident. However, I believe the mention of Santiago is merely a diversion, a tactic to mislead us. Perhaps it was intentionally used to divert M. Renauld's suspicions away from a closer threat. Rest assured, Hastings, the danger looming over him did not originate in Santiago, but rather much closer, within France."" His words carried a weight of seriousness and certainty that left me no room for doubt.",1
"As soon as I laid eyes on the lifeless body, a chilling resemblance to Jack sent shivers down my spine. Draped in Jack's elegant overcoat, the deceased also clutched the very same paper-knife he had gifted Bella. Odds were high that her fingerprints still lingered on its sharp edge. The sheer terror of the situation overwhelmed me, leaving me with only one clear thought - secure the dagger and disappear before its absence was noticed. Feigning a fainting spell, I seized the weapon while you fetched water, concealing it within the folds of my dress.",1
"As the Revolution finally subsided, Colonel Race arrived in Cape Town. Following his suggestion, we all moved into the grand villa in Muizenberg once owned by Sir Lawrence Eardsley. Plans were made for my return to England with Suzanne, where we would marry at her London home. The trousseau was to be purchased in Paris, a task that Suzanne took great pleasure in organizing. Despite the excitement, the future appeared strangely distant. At times, a suffocating sensation gripped me, leaving me breathless. On the eve of our departure, sleep eluded me.",1
"I arrived at the edge of the cliff, overlooking the vast ocean below, far from any signs of civilization. A young boy with a friendly smile greeted me at the door. ""Are you here to see Mrs. Raffini?"" he asked. Leading me through a narrow hallway, he opened a door for me. As I prepared to enter, a feeling of unease washed over me. Ignoring my instincts, I crossed the threshold and the door closed abruptly behind me. A man stood up from his desk, approaching me with a welcoming smile. ""We are delighted you decided to join us, Miss Thompson,"" he said.",1
"What cunning! He anticipated every move a detective might make, steps that I, a foolish fool, actually made. He prepares two wills, has the staff sign both, then confidently presents his will on the back of a crumpled receipt, using a pen filled with his own unique ink. Under false pretenses, he convinces the baker and his spouse to add their signatures below his, then attaches it to his desk key, smirking to himself. Should his niece uncover his deception, she will prove her worth and expensive education, earning her rightful claim to his fortune.",1
"""Parties sometimes join me on my boat from the hotel, but my expenses are minimal and I live as I wish."" ""Do you live here alone?"" ""I have no desire for company,"" he replied coldly. ""I apologize for imposing mine on you,"" I responded, ""but I had no say in the matter."" Surprisingly, his eyes sparkled slightly. ""None at all. I lifted you over my shoulders like a sack of coal and brought you to my boat. Reminiscent of a primitive man from the Stone Age."" ""For a different reason,"" I added. This time, he blushed deeply, his face turning a shade of tan.",1
"""Trust me, I've examined all the details. M. Jack Renauld came in on the train. There was an hour gap before he showed up at the house. It's clear that he saw Captain Hastings and his partner exit the shed, snuck in himself, grabbed the dagger, and stabbed his partner in the shed.""""But the partner was already dead!"" Giraud shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't realize that. Perhaps he thought the partner was just asleep. It's likely they had a meeting planned. Either way, he knew that this second murder would make the case much more complicated. And it did.""",1
"""You know, I have feelings for someone else,"" I admitted. His response was a simple, ""I understand."" I hesitated before confessing, ""It didn't start out that way when we met on the Kilmorden."" His next words carried a weight I had never felt before, ""I see."" His expression was stern, a stark contrast to his usual demeanor. ""What are you trying to say?"" I asked, my voice wavering. His gaze was intense, commanding. ""I now know what needs to be done,"" he declared. His declaration sent a chill down my spine, his resolve both mysterious and unsettling.",1
"I took the envelope from her hand as we said our goodbyes. Inside, five brand new five-pound notes greeted me along with a note that read: “I hope you will not be offended and will accept this with my love.” Despite our differences, she truly was a kind woman. With twenty-five pounds in my pocket, I was ready to embark on my journey into the unknown. It wasn't until the fourth day that the stewardess convinced me to venture up on deck. I had believed staying below would hasten my demise, but I was slowly coming to realize the error in my thinking.",1
"""But just one or two minor details I'd appreciate your input on nonetheless. Captain Hastings, who is familiar with me, will head up to the residence to notify them of your arrival. By the way, Captain Hastings, where is the little man?” “He's currently bedridden with the flu.” “Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Quite a predicament, you being here without him, isn't it?” With that rather poorly timed joke, I proceeded to the house. I pressed the doorbell, after Japp shut the door. After a brief wait, a middle-aged woman in black answered the door. ""Mr.",1
"""Unfortunately, the Prime Minister’s vehicle inexplicably veered off the main road,” Poirot interjected. “Around a bend in the road?” “Yes, but how did you surmise that?” “Oh, it’s obvious! Please, go on.” Lord Estair continued, “Without explanation, the Prime Minister’s car departed from the main road. Meanwhile, the police vehicle, oblivious to the detour, stayed on the main route. Further along the deserted path, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly halted by a group of masked individuals. The driver” Poirot mused, “That courageous O’Murphy!”",1
"A large settee covered in chintz sat against the wall, the window seats also upholstered in the same faded fabric. Poirot, with his small cigarette in hand, discussed their plan of action. The key to their investigation, he believed, lay within this room. They would carefully examine the desk's documents for any hidden clues. After some questioning, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen from Plymouth to create a secret compartment in the fireplace. With this new lead, they set off to Plymouth to uncover the truth.",1
"Poirot hesitated before turning to M. Hautet. ""Let's head there now,"" he said quietly. As we made our way to the scene, I could sense Poirot's determination to uncover the truth behind the murder. However, when he finally spoke, it was with an odd awkwardness that seemed out of place. ""His overcoat was quite long,"" Poirot remarked, his voice strained. M. Hautet greeted us in the hall, and we followed Françoise upstairs. Poirot's erratic movement caught my attention, but he explained in a whisper, ""We must be cautious, the servants are listening.""",1
"The roots of the tree in question extended all the way to the rear of the bed, making it necessary to step on the bed in order to reach them. The commissary pointed out that due to the dry weather, no footprints would be visible on the paths or driveway, but they would be noticeable on the soft soil of the flower-bed. Poirot carefully inspected the smooth surface of the bed, confirming Bex's observation that there were no marks or indentations. Satisfied, Poirot abruptly shifted his attention to the neighboring flower-bed for further examination.",1
"""Shortly thereafter, I heard a commotion in the residence that seemed to have spooked them, leading to my husband being forcibly taken into my quarters in a state of undress."" ""Excuse me,"" Poirot interjected, ""is there no other way out of the dressing room?"" ""No, sir, only a door connecting to my room. They rushed my husband inside, the shorter man leading the way, the taller one following closely with a dagger in hand. Paul attempted to reach me, his eyes filled with anguish. He pleaded with his abductors. 'I need to talk to her,' he insisted.""",1
"I had survived multiple attempts on my life by him, witnessed him murder an innocent woman, and was aware of his involvement in numerous other crimes unbeknownst to me. Despite this knowledge, I couldn't bring myself to fully comprehend the gravity of his actions. He remained in my eyes as a charming and affable companion on our travels. Strangely, I couldn't muster any fear towards him, despite knowing his capacity to order my execution without hesitation. The only comparison I could draw was to Stevenson's infamous character, Long John Silver.",1
"I headed out after lunch, wearing my best hat (a hand-me-down from Suzanne) and my least wrinkled white linen. Taking a quick train to Muizenberg, I arrived in just thirty minutes. The journey was pleasant as we circled around the foot of Table Mountain, passing by some beautiful flowers. Due to my poor geography skills, I had never fully grasped that Cape Town is situated on a peninsula. So, I was taken aback when I stepped off the train and found myself staring at the sea once again. The sight of people enjoying the water was truly delightful.",1
"Leaving the girl hidden in the bushes, I made my way into the residence. Marchaud stood guard by the entrance to the salon. Inside, voices whispered in conversation. ""Is Monsieur in need of Hautet? He's inside, questioning Françoise once more."" ""No,"" I quickly replied, ""I have no use for him. However, I do require the key to the shed outside, if it's not forbidden."" ""But of course, monsieur."" He handed it over. ""Here you go. Judge M. ordered that you have full access to everything. Just return it to me once you're done, that's all."" ""Certainly.""",1
"The doctor repeatedly pressed the doorbell, but there was no response from inside. Frustrated, he turned to the lift attendant and inquired about a pass-key. The attendant mentioned one being in the porter's office downstairs. Poirot suggested calling the police, which the doctor agreed with. After a short absence, the attendant returned with the manager, who demanded an explanation for the commotion. The doctor explained that they had received a distressing call from Count Foscatini, claiming he had been assaulted and was in critical condition.",1
"The Villa was cloaked in darkness as we approached Mrs. Renauld's bedroom window. Suddenly, a cry for help pierced the silence, followed by a shadowy struggle. Poirot sprang into action, climbing a tree to enter the room through the window. Meanwhile, Cinderella, the acrobat, swung from the roof to rescue Mrs. Renauld. In the end, Marthe Daubreuil was unmasked as the murderer of Mr. Renauld and the would-be murderer of Mrs. Renauld. The night's events left me bewildered and exhausted, with Poirot unraveling the intricate web of motives and lies.",1
"“Do you have another plan up your sleeve? Let me take a wild guess. Are you planning to sell the Star of the East?” Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s correct. It’s been passed down through the family for generations, but it’s not tied to any inheritance. However, finding a buyer isn’t as simple as it seems. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden dealer, is in search of a potential customer, but time is running out.” Lady Yardly interjected with one more question, “Which plan does she agree with?” “She strongly objects to selling the jewel,” Lord Yardly replied.",1
"""I see myself as a specialized consultant."" Japp chuckled. ""I bet you five pounds that you can't point me in the direction of Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, within a week."" Poirot pondered. ""Very well, my friend, I agree. The thrill of the chase is a passion for you English. Now, the details."" ""Last Saturday, Mr. Davenheim boarded the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, his estate, The Cedars, being located there. He had lunch, inspected the grounds, and spoke with the gardeners as usual. Everyone noted that he was acting completely normal.""",1
"""Remember, not a word of this to Giraud,"" I cautioned Poirot. ""He seems to dismiss me as inconsequential. But we'll see about that. I did drop a hint to him, out of common decency. If he chooses to ignore it, that's on him."" Poirot nodded, trusting in my discretion. ""Very well then, let's engage our little grey cells. Do you have an estimate of when the tragedy occurred?"" I replied, ""Around two o'clock, I believe."" Poirot raised an eyebrow in surprise. ""Yes, Mrs. Renauld mentioned hearing the clock chime while the men were present in the room.""",1
"“Renauld’s?” My eyes widened in shock. “His anger towards his son, undoubtedly.” “But he wrote affectionate letters to him in Paris?” “That's what Jack Renauld claims, but he has no proof.”“Let's move on from that.”“Now, let's focus on the day of the tragedy. You've organized the morning events in a specific sequence. Is there a reason for that?”“I discovered that the letter to me was sent out at the same time as the telegram. Shortly after, Masters was given time off. In my view, the altercation with the tramp occurred before these incidents.”",1
"A large chintz-covered sofa was placed against the wall, while the window seats were adorned with the same faded chintz fabric. Poirot, with his customary cigarette in hand, proposed a plan to search for a clue in the room. The key to the desk had an unfamiliar note attached to it, indicating a different presence in the house. After questioning the Bakers, it was revealed that Mr. Marsh had a second will and had hired workmen to create a hidden compartment in the fireplace. With this new information, we set off to Plymouth to uncover the truth.",1
"I arrived at the Villa Medgee after a challenging search. The people arrived on the waves on short curved boards. It was too early for tea, so I headed to the bathing pavilion. When offered a surf board, I eagerly accepted. Surfing seemed simple at first glance, but I quickly learned otherwise. Despite my initial frustration, I was determined to try again. Eventually, I caught a good wave and felt pure joy. Surfing has a way of bringing out strong emotions. Whether cursing vigorously or feeling foolishly proud, the experience is always intense.",1
"Mrs. Havering had been searching for a new housekeeper and had interviewed several candidates. However, when she sent the engagement fee, she failed to inform them of her decision. Disappointed, I returned to London where I found Poirot lounging in a flamboyant silk robe. He welcomed me warmly, expressing his fondness for me. ""My dear Hastings, how delightful to see you! Have you had a good time? Have you been assisting Japp and conducting your own investigations?"" ""Poirot,"" I exclaimed, ""this case is shrouded in darkness! It seems unsolvable.""",1
"Rushing into the bedroom at the sound of faint moans, she was met with a horrifying scene. Madame Beroldy was on the floor, her hands and feet tied, emitting weak cries after managing to remove the gag from her mouth. Meanwhile, Monsieur Beroldy lay on the bed, surrounded by a pool of blood, a knife plunged into his heart. Madame Beroldy recounted the harrowing events that had unfolded - two masked figures had startled her awake, restraining and silencing her before turning their attention to Monsieur Beroldy in search of a mysterious ""secret"".",1
"""Mrs. Davenheim is a rather unintelligent woman, a nonentity,"" pondered Poirot. ""Had he any enemies?"" ""Plenty of financial rivals,"" replied Hastings. ""A figure was seen near the rose-garden,"" mentioned Hastings. ""Beyond lies a lake with a boathouse,"" added Hastings. Japp walked in bursting with news. ""We found his clothes, identical to what he wore that day,"" announced Japp. ""Lowen was seen near the study,"" continued Japp. ""Mr. Davenheim's ring was pawned by Billy Kellett,"" Japp explained. ""Kellett saw a man with a big moustache,"" shared Japp.",1
"""Poirot, what do you make of this?"" I asked, watching as he scanned the letter with intense concentration. After a moment, he looked up and replied thoughtfully, ""It appears to be a classic case of deception and betrayal. The question is, who is the true mastermind behind it all?"" I nodded, pondering his words. ""Do you think it's someone close to the victim?"" I inquired. Poirot's eyes gleamed with a hint of mischief. ""Ah, but in matters of crime, my dear Hastings, one must always consider all possibilities. Even those that seem most unlikely.""",1
"After having tea, he mentioned to his wife that he needed to walk down to the village to mail some letters. He also informed her that a Mr. Lowen was expected for business. In case Mr. Lowen arrived before his return, he should be directed to the study to wait. Mr. Davenheim left the house through the front entrance, strolled down the driveway, exited through the gate, and mysteriously disappeared. He was never spotted again after that moment. ""Quite intriguing, a delightful little mystery,"" whispered Poirot. ""Please continue, my dear friend.""",1
"At the trial, the prisoner Renauld sat nervously next to his lawyer, Maître Grosíer. A stern guard, armed with a gleaming sabre, stood watch by the door, while the diligent greffier busied himself at his desk. The magistrate wasted no time. ""Renauld,"" he interrogated, ""do you still claim you were in Cherbourg on the night of the crime, despite all evidence pointing to Merlinville?"" Jack hesitated, his voice trembling as he repeated, ""I told you, I was in Cherbourg."" Maître Grosíer's expression darkened, a mix of frustration and disappointment.",1
"Madame Daubreuil and her daughter were an intriguing pair. The daughter, innocent and pure, caught in the web of her mother's secrets. Madame Daubreuil, charming and enigmatic, with a past shrouded in mystery. As the examining magistrate probed for answers, the tension in the room grew palpable. The daughter's loyalty to her mother unwavering, while Madame Daubreuil's composure never faltered. The air was thick with unspoken truths and hidden motives. It was clear that beneath their facade of civility, lurked a darkness waiting to be revealed.",1
"“Have you heard of anyone by the name of ‘Duveen’?” Mrs. Renauld paused before responding, “Duveen? No, I can’t say that I have.” Poirot pressed on, “Has your husband ever mentioned anyone by that name?” “Never,” she replied firmly. “Do you know anyone named Bella?” Poirot observed Mrs. Renauld closely for any reaction, but she simply shook her head. Undeterred, he continued, “Did you know that your husband had a visitor last night?” A hint of color rose in her cheeks, but she asked calmly, “Oh, did he? Who was it?” “A lady,” Poirot revealed.",1
"“It's beyond me! It's just plain stupid! They had everything planned out for the abduction, and it was all well thought out too. But instead of keeping it low-key, they decided to go all out with a melodramatic attack that seemed straight out of a movie. It's hard to take it seriously, with their group of masked men so close to London!” “Maybe there were two different groups trying to pull off the same thing at the same time,” I proposed. “No, that's too much of a coincidence! And besides, someone must have been a traitor in the first place.”",1
"""Lady Yardly,"" I said, ""I know the reason behind your visit. You have been targeted by blackmailers regarding the diamond."" My words hit their mark, evident from the shock on her face. She stared at me, speechless and pale. ""You are aware?"" she gasped. ""How?"" I maintained my composure. ""It's a simple deduction. If Miss Marvell, with one of the twin diamonds, has received threatening letters,"" ""Miss Marvell? She was here?"" ""She just departed. So, if she's been warned, it follows that you, with the other diamond, would have also been a target.""",1
"""Never one to pay attention to legs, he would sooner die than admit it. He finds my fascination with such matters frivolous. Enjoying irritating Pagett, I added with malice: “Since you've met her, why not invite her to join us for dinner tomorrow night at the Fancy Dress dance. And don't forget to pick out a fancy costume for me at the barber.” “You wouldn't actually attend in fancy dress, would you?” Pagett exclaimed, horrified. It was clear that such behavior didn't align with his perception of my dignity. He appeared shocked and dismayed.""",1
"“Where is your assistant now?” “He’s out sick with a stomach issue,” I replied. “Are you certain it’s just a stomach issue?” “Absolutely. He gets them often.” My guest smirked. “It might be more than a stomach issue. Only time will tell. But let me assure you, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray wouldn’t be shocked if there was an attempt to remove your assistant. Don’t worry about yourself” I must have shown a hint of concern “you’re not in danger. With your assistant gone, it would be easier to reach you. Either way, Mr. Milray wants me to go with you.",1
"""You recall the De Beer jewels?” “Yes, I recall. In Kimberley, just prior to the war? I was not involved, and I never learned the specifics, the incident was kept quiet for some reason, correct? Quite a lucrative heist.” “Valued at a hundred thousand pounds. Two of us executed it as per the ‘Colonel’s’ instructions, naturally. That's when I seized my opportunity. The idea was to swap out some of the De Beer diamonds with sample diamonds carried from South America by two inexperienced miners who were coincidentally in Kimberley at that moment.",1
"I made my way to my cabin earlier than usual. The stewardess was informed that I was fighting a cold and was not bothered by any odors. Despite her concern, I stood my ground. The night dragged on endlessly. Eventually, I retired to bed, but not without preparing for the worst. I wrapped myself in a heavy dressing gown and slipped on my warm slippers. Fully dressed for action, I was ready to react to any unforeseen events. What exactly was I anticipating? The possibilities were unclear, a jumble of far-fetched scenarios raced through my mind.",1
"Silently, the Kilmorden approached closer and closer, like a dream to Anne Beddingfeld. As she marveled at the world around her, she noticed a figure by her side. It was Rayburn, the man she had encountered the night before. His warning about the dangerous business she was involved in sent shivers down her spine. He advised her to be cautious and not to meddle in affairs that could put her in harm's way. Despite her confusion, Rayburn's words struck a chord with her. She couldn't help but wonder why he was going out of his way to protect her.",1
"The ""Colonel"" was a mastermind of systematic crime, orchestrating operations through his network of followers. His presence on the Kilmorden Castle indicated that Colonel Race was hot on his trail, working to bring him down. The danger was closing in, with enemies surrounding and watching closely. An unexpected turn of events led to a frantic escape, dodging arrest and boarding a train just in time. The unexpected appearance on the train surprised everyone, leading to a humorous interaction with Sir Eustace and his unconventional secretaries.",1
"“As Hastings indicates, bodies tend to be discovered persistently.” “Moreover, a gardener mentioned spotting a silhouette heading towards the rose-garden from the side of the residence. The study's lengthy French window overlooks the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently used that entrance. However, the gardener was far away tending to cucumber frames, unable to confirm if it was his employer's figure. Additionally, the time is uncertain, but it was likely before six since the gardeners finish their work by then.” “Could it have been Mr.",1
"""Furthermore, the fact that he openly pawned the ring suggests that murder was not his motive. Additionally, a sneak-thief is typically not a killer. Moreover, since he has been incarcerated since Saturday, it would be too coincidental for him to provide such a detailed description of Lowen."" Japp agreed with a nod. ""I'm not saying you're wrong. However, convincing a jury to consider a jailbird's testimony will be a challenge. What baffles me is why Lowen didn't come up with a more clever plan to get rid of the ring."" Poirot simply shrugged.",1
"""I'm an actress. No, not the kind you're thinking of - lunching at the Savoy covered with jewelry, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So's face cream. I've been on the boards since I was a kid of six tumbling."" ""I beg your pardon,"" I said puzzled. ""Haven't you seen child acrobats?"" ""Oh, I understand."" ""I'm American born, but I've spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now."" ""We?"" ""My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in.""",1
"""Make haste to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines. Request the loan of a woman with captivating eyes, amenable to hand-holding,” instructed Sir Eustace. The secretary nodded, “A skilled short-hand-typist shall be sought.” Sir Eustace scowled, “Pagett is vexing. He'll likely select a displeasing woman to vex me further. Don't forget, she must possess dainty feet.” Excitedly, I grasped Suzanne's hand and led her to her quarters. ""Suzanne, time is of the essence. We must devise our plans swiftly.""",1
"""The crime scene was meticulously staged to mislead investigators about the time of death. Madame Renauld, the examining magistrate, and everyone else accepted the initial timeline without question. However, Hercule Poirot, with his keen eye for detail, knew that the truth was being concealed. The doctors' examination of the body revealed that death had actually occurred much earlier than indicated at the crime scene. There was a deliberate effort to create a false narrative, but Poirot was determined to uncover the real timeline of events.""",1
"“You can guess, I dare say. But mark my words, I will vindicate myself, or meet my demise in the pursuit, and I will strangle the wretch who attempted to end your life the other evening.” “Let us be just,” I remarked. “He never physically shoved me.” “He didn’t need to. His scheme was more cunning than that. I inspected the path later on. Everything appeared normal, but from the indentations on the ground I deduced that the stones bordering the path had been lifted and repositioned slightly. There are lofty shrubs growing right at the edge.”",1
"He used to be a beachcomber and a remittance man on various South Sea islands before coming back to New York two years ago, where he quickly spiraled downwards. What struck me the most was that he recently acquired enough money to travel to Egypt. ""I have a friend there who can lend me some,"" he confidently stated. However, his plans took a turn for the worse. He returned to New York, bitterly cursing his miserly uncle who valued ancient kings' bones more than his own family. It was while he was in Egypt that Sir John Willard met his demise.",1
"I peered through the keyhole, expecting to hear voices. Sure enough, the big Dutchman was one of the speakers. The other man remained just out of sight. Abruptly, he stood up to pour himself a drink, revealing his back in dark clothing. Even before he faced me, I recognized him. Mr. Chichester! Gradually, I caught snippets of their conversation. ""It's risky, nonetheless. What if her companions seek retribution?"" the big man muttered. Chichester responded, abandoning his usual clergyman's tone. It was no wonder I hadn't identified him sooner.",1
"We were isolated from society, resembling Adam and Eve in solitude but with stark contrasts! Old Batani loitered nearby, observing like a curious dog. I took charge of cooking, despite the challenge with only one functional arm. Harry often roamed outside, while we passed hours together lounging in the palm tree shade, conversing, arguing, touching on all topics imaginable, fighting and reconciling. Our arguments were frequent, yet a genuine and enduring camaraderie developed, beyond what I thought feasible. That, and an unspoken connection.",1
"With the ability to feign emotions, she mirrors her mother's cold, calculating nature. It's unclear if she truly believed in her control over the boy's feelings. Though she charmed him, the boy could easily be pulled away by his father. However, with Mr. Renauld's demise and Jack inheriting a large portion of his fortune, the marriage becomes imminent. In a single move, she will secure wealth far beyond the meager sums she has managed to obtain thus far. Her sharp mind grasps the straightforwardness of the situation. It all seems effortless.",1
""" Célestine let out a sharp scream, grabbing onto Poirot's arm. He leaned in and whispered something in her ear. She gazed up at him with uncertainty. “Yes, yes, my child, I assure you it is wiser not to fight back.” Then he faced the inspector. “May I, sir? A small test for my personal curiosity.” “Depends on the nature of it,” the police officer responded vaguely. Poirot turned back to Célestine. “You mentioned going into your room to get a spool of thread. Where exactly was it?” “On the dresser, sir.” “And the scissors?” “There as well.""",1
"""He might have had,"" I answered thoughtfully, recalling our discussion after returning from the Matoppos. ""He’s a very powerful personality,"" I continued, ""but not at all my idea of the 'Colonel.' And, in any case, the notion is preposterous. He’s with the Secret Service."" ""But how can we be sure of that? It’s so easy to insinuate such things. No one refutes it, and the gossip spreads until it's accepted as absolute truth. It justifies all sorts of questionable actions. Anne, what’s your opinion on Race?"" ""I have mixed feelings,"" I replied.",1
"""I had no idea that cannibalism was considered a sacred topic,"" I shot back, feeling a twinge of irritation. But as I spoke, a new thought occurred to me. Considering Mr. Chichester's supposed two-year stay in the heart of Africa, why did he not appear more tanned? His complexion was as fair as that of a newborn baby. Something didn't quite add up. Despite his flawless demeanor, there was an air of artificiality about him. Could he be compared to a theatrical clergyman, I wondered, recalling the young curates from my days in Little Hampsly.",1
"""The note, penned on an exotic parchment, displayed a confident, distinctive script: “Chateau Genevieve, Merlinville-sur-Mer, France “Dear Detective, “I require your expertise urgently and, due to certain circumstances that I will explain later, prefer not to involve the authorities. Your reputation precedes you, with word on the street being that you are not only highly skilled, but also adept at maintaining discretion. Sending sensitive information via mail is risky, but I live in constant dread of my safety due to a confidential matter.""",1
"""And rightly so! Your crime was a horrifying one, condemned by both gods and men!” M. Hautet declared, relishing the opportunity to deliver his speech with gravitas. “You have taken a life, and now you must face the consequences. I do not address you as a mere mortal, but as the embodiment of eternal Justice,” M. Hautet's speech was abruptly cut short. The door swung open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” the attendant stuttered, “there is a woman here who claims, who claims ” “Who claims what?” the magistrate demanded, his patience wearing thin.",1
"""But he chose his words carefully: “Certainly, the ‘Colonel’ is known for being a generous employer. I believe his ability to shift blame onto others has played a significant role in his achievements. A brilliant mind, truly extraordinary! A firm believer in the principle, ‘If you want something done right, don’t do it yourself!’ Here we all are, implicated and completely at his mercy, yet none of us can find any fault with him.” He stopped, as if anticipating a rebuttal from her, but she simply smiled quietly. “None of us,” he reflected.""",1
"“No, I promised myself that I would care for you better than anyone else could. No one ever visits this secluded island. I convinced old Batani, who I once helped recover from a fever, to come and take care of you. She is trustworthy and will never betray us. I could hide you here for months and no one would suspect a thing.” The thought of those words brought me satisfaction. “You made the right decision,” I assured calmly. “I won’t reach out to anyone. A few more days of uncertainty won’t change much. After all, they are not my own kin.”",1
"""Your lack of manners is truly appalling,"" I remarked icily. ""I'm afraid I must bid you farewell."" He made a move towards the exit, stumbling along the way. Reacting quickly, I guided him to the sofa with a firm hand. ""Stop being foolish,"" I scolded bluntly. ""You wouldn't want to leave a trail of blood throughout the entire ship, would you?"" He appeared to grasp the logic behind my words, sitting still as I tended to his wound as well as I could. ""There,"" I declared, giving my handiwork a satisfied pat. ""That will have to suffice for now.""",1
"As he performed the act, half of the spectators erupted in loud barks of ""Woof, woof!"" possibly a Dutch equivalent to ""Hear, hear,"" while the other half jolted awake from their peaceful slumber. I was informed that the man had been talking non-stop for a staggering three days. It appears patience is a virtue in South Africa. I concocted numerous reasons to detain Pagett in Cape Town, but my creativity has finally reached its limit. Tomorrow, he will accompany me with the loyalty of a faithful dog ready to meet his end by his master's side.",1
"“How can I deal with a secretary like that? His face is an unpleasant shade of yellow, not a good match for a black eye. I'm done with secretaries unless I find a nice girl, someone with gentle eyes who will comfort me when I'm upset. What do you say, Miss Anne? Are you up for the job?"" ""How often will I need to comfort you?"" I inquired, chuckling. ""All day long,"" Sir Eustace flirtatiously replied. ""I won't get much work done if that's the case,"" I teased. ""That's alright. This workload is all Pagett's doing. He's working me to the bone.""",1
"""The cabin must have held some secrets,"" I suggested. ""That would make sense of why my belongings were thrown about the following day. Yet, I scoured every inch and found nothing hidden."" ""Do you think the young man could have planted something in a drawer while you were distracted?"" Suzanne proposed. I dismissed the idea. ""I would have noticed."" ""Perhaps they were after your important document?"" she pondered. ""It's possible, but it had already served its purpose. The time and date had come and gone."" Suzanne concurred, ""True, of course.""",1
"""The check was made out to a certain Duveen,"" Poirot pointed out. ""I suspect it was the former,"" he continued, ""considering the resemblance to M. Renauld's handwriting."" The authenticity was quickly confirmed by cross-referencing it with a note found on the desk. The commissary, looking sheepish, muttered, ""I can't believe I missed this."" Poirot chuckled. ""Always check under the mats! My associate Hastings knows that any irregularity bothers me. When I noticed the rug askew, I immediately thought, 'Ah! The chair leg must have nudged it.'""",1
"A second diamond, identical in shape and size, served as the right eye. Legend had it that this gem too would eventually be taken. 'One eye will head West, the other East, until they reunite. Then, they will come back to the deity in glory.' It's interesting to note that there exists currently a gem closely resembling this one, referred to as 'the Star of the West' or 'the Western Star.' This precious stone belongs to the renowned movie star, Mary Marvell. A side-by-side analysis of these two jewels would be fascinating."" She fell silent.",1
"As I entered the dimly lit room, the moonlight cast eerie shadows across the floor. The wooden floorboards creaked beneath my weight as I cautiously made my way further inside. Suddenly, a faint whisper reached my ears, causing me to freeze in place. Time seemed to stand still as I hesitated, contemplating the potential dangers that lay ahead. Despite the risks, my insatiable curiosity drove me forward. Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself and pressed on, determined to uncover the secrets hidden within the walls of the mysterious house.",1
"I've been in this business a long time, and I've learned to trust my instincts. You have to be one step ahead of the game, always ready for the unexpected. The key is to keep your eyes open and your mind sharp, never letting your guard down. That's how you stay alive in this world of shadows and secrets. The truth is, you never know who's watching, who's waiting to strike. That's why you have to be ready for anything, even when it comes from the most unlikely sources. It's a dangerous game we play, but it's the only one I know how to win.",1
"In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation while Ned made inquiries about Sir Eustace's party. I told Harry I wouldn't go to Beira. It was decided I would join Suzanne and focus on self-preservation. The diamonds would be deposited under the name of Parker. I suggested a code: any message from me would have 'and' crossed out, wires signed 'Andy.' Ned mentioned the train's imminent arrival. Anne teased Harry about marriage, to which he responded possessively. Just then, Mrs. Blair barged in frantically looking for Anne.",1
"When he dared to challenge Fate, he proved to be a skilled player. He could face defeat with a grin. ""Regardless,"" he remarked casually, ""I doubt our paths will cross again."" ""No,"" I responded slowly. ""I don't think so."" ""Farewell then."" ""Farewell."" He squeezed my hand tightly, his unusual gleaming eyes locking with mine for a moment, then he abruptly departed, his footsteps resonating along the ship's deck. The sound reverberated in my ears. Footsteps exiting my world. I must confess, the following couple of hours were far from pleasant.",1
"""Despite your insistence, I, Hercule Poirot, refuse to degrade myself by laying on the ground (perhaps on wet grass) to analyze imaginary footprints, or collecting cigarette ash without understanding the different types.

Upon his return, I was able to accurately describe his findings without leaving my room.” “Are you suggesting that Japp's efforts were fruitless?” “On the contrary, his discoveries only served to support my deductions.""",1
"He casually signed the receipt, mentioning offhandedly: ""This pen feels different, but I injured my hand in a rush."" The employee just grinned and noted little change. Rolf chuckled and added: ""Just don't mistake me for a criminal this time. Been receiving ominous notes from a Chinese man, and the problem is, I bear a resemblance to one myself, especially in the eyes."" ""I observed him,"" the clerk recounted, ""and immediately understood his point. The eyes angled upwards like those of an Asian. It had never caught my attention previously.""",1
"He journeyed through the countryside, eager to reach his destination before the day grew hot. In the early hours, he commanded his assistants to prepare the mules for travel. Despite the animals' initial resistance, they were eventually ready to depart. The mules surged forward at a rapid pace, and as dawn broke, the reason became clear. Unbeknownst to them in the darkness, a lion had been harnessed as the lead mule. This revelation sparked amusement among the group, although the Labour Member's grave reaction hinted at a deeper concern.",1
"I never planned on dressing up, but seeing Pagett so uncomfortable was too good to resist. ""What are you talking about?"" I asked. ""We're definitely wearing costumes. You too."" Pagett hesitated. ""Then go check out the costumes at the barber shop,"" I instructed. ""I hope they have your size,"" Pagett mumbled, eyeing me up and down. Sometimes, without realizing it, Pagett can be quite rude. ""And book a table for six at the restaurant,"" I continued. ""We'll invite the Captain, the woman with the attractive legs, Mrs. Blair"" ""You won't find Mrs.",1
"I was no stranger to the stage, having acted extensively during my years at Cambridge. It was a simple matter for me to assume the persona of a solemn, mature gentleman with a full beard. During the voyage, I made a point of avoiding Carton, feigning illness and secluding myself in my cabin. Once we arrived in London, I had no trouble tracking his movements. Carton checked into a hotel and remained indoors until the next day. At nearly one o’clock, he emerged and I discreetly followed him to a real estate agent's office in Knightsbridge.",1
"Renauld plans to disguise himself as a tramp and leave town unnoticed after committing the crime. He stages the scene to implicate others and creates a false trail of evidence. However, justice catches up to him in the end. Poirot solves the case by unraveling the deeper mystery behind the crime.

A secretary like me isn’t supposed to have a spouse, so I kept it hidden.” “You surprise me,” I commented. “Where has she been all this time?” “We’ve had a small cottage by the river in Marlow, near the Mill House, for more than five years.” “Goodness gracious,” I muttered. “Do you have any children?” “Four children, Sir Eustace.” I stared at him in disbelief. I should have realized that someone like Pagett wouldn’t harbor a dark secret. Pagett’s respectable image has always been a thorn in my side.”",1
"""We rushed up the driveway in pursuit of the fleeing silhouette. Catching sight of a dark figure in robes on the side terrace of the mansion, our target changed course and we followed suit, leading us to witness the encounter. Mrs. Maltravers appeared to almost lose her balance, her face visibly paling. “You,” she stammered. “I thought you were sailing to East Africa?” “I received urgent news from my solicitors that held me back,” the young man clarified. “My late uncle in Scotland passed away suddenly and bequeathed me an inheritance.""",1
"Poirot was examining the crime scene thoroughly, his attention caught by a piece of discoloured lead-piping near the spade. Giraud, the Paris detective, seemed uninterested and continued his search. Poirot, however, was intrigued and found it very interesting. M. Bex, impressed by Poirot's quick understanding of the situation, praised him highly. The detective's efficiency was undeniable, even though I harbored a dislike for him. Poirot's focus on seemingly insignificant details puzzled me, but he seemed determined to uncover the truth.",1
"The leather handbag she clutched tightly held an overstuffed wallet and a few coins, a delicate lace hanky with no initials, and the torn half of a train ticket to Paris. Not much to work with. These were the facts shared far and wide by the Evening Post, with ""Locate the Gentleman in the Tan Suit"" as their repeated call to action. Each day, approximately five hundred individuals penned letters boasting of their triumph in the pursuit, while statuesque youths with sun-kissed complexions lamented the moment they agreed to don a tan suit.",1
"The waiting game was all too familiar. A quick glance at the Robinson listing in the phone book was all it took to confirm suspicions. It was only a matter of time before a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson would make an appearance. And when she did, the avenger would not be far behind. Armed with a name and address, vengeance would be swift. Miss Elsa Hardt, as always, narrowly escaping her fate. Oh, Hastings, the introduction to the true Mrs. Robinson will be quite the affair! The shock of a break-in awaiting them at home. We must make haste.",1
"""At that moment, the front door opened and M. Hautet and the commissary descended the steps. ""Ah, M. Poirot, we were just about to search for you,"" the magistrate stated. ""Although it is late, I feel compelled to visit Madame Daubreuil. Surely, she will be greatly distressed by M. Renauld's passing, and perhaps we can find a lead from her.

Hautet's choice of words quite striking.""",1
"“Can you recall the topics of conversation during Tuesday night's dinner?” Poirot inquired. “Well, we touched on various odd subjects. Maltravers inquired about my family, then we delved into the issue of German reparations. Mrs. Maltravers had many queries about East Africa, to which I shared a couple of anecdotes,” the witness replied. Poirot paused briefly before proposing, “May I conduct a small experiment with your consent? You have divulged all that your conscious mind is aware of, now I wish to probe your subconscious thoughts.”",1
"“Excuse me, if it’s already spoken for.” “Oh, I apologize, ma'am. I've been bothered quite a bit by those journalists. Can't catch a break. No, the house isn't rented and probably won't be now.” “Are the pipes faulty?” I questioned quietly. “Goodness, no, ma'am, the pipes are fine! But surely you've heard about that foreign woman who was murdered here?” “I think I remember reading something about it in the news,” I replied casually. My lack of concern intrigued the kind lady. Had I shown any curiosity, she likely would have clammed up.",1
"""Youth calls to youth, but my work still beckons,"" I said quietly. It felt impossible to love two men simultaneously, yet the allure of this man was undeniable. Looking into his eyes, I whispered, ""Your future is destined for greatness. You will leave a mark on the world."" It was as if I was foreseeing his path. ""I will be alone,"" he mused. ""That's the price of greatness,"" I assured him. With a gentle grasp of my hand, he confessed, ""I wish it was the other way."" Just then, Harry appeared from around the house, interrupting our moment.",1
"He stood up to greet me when I entered the room, taking both of my hands in his and patting them gently. ""My dear child,"" he whispered. ""My dear, dear child."" Despite myself, I couldn't help but feel like a vulnerable orphan in his presence. His demeanor was soothing and paternal, yet there was an underlying hint of condescension. It was clear that he saw me as a naive young woman facing a harsh world alone. I quickly realized that there was no point in trying to prove him wrong. And in the end, maybe it was for the best that I didn't.",1
"Papa never cared for others' opinions. He lived detached from daily life, eating without concern for payment. His celebrity brought no money, only trouble when a reporter twisted his words. I longed for romance and adventure, envying Emily's suitors. My only excitement came from daydreams and the Kinema. Yet, a discovery in Rhodesia would soon bring real adventure to my doorstep. Papa was ecstatic about the find, convinced it was the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. We had to leave at once to explore the area for more treasures.",1
"Poirot and Hastings were deep in discussion, trying to unravel the mystery of the crime that had taken place. Poirot was convinced that the key to the case lay in the details surrounding Mr. Renauld's murder. As they debated various theories, Hastings suggested that perhaps the open door was a clue that had been overlooked. Poirot considered this idea, but shook his head, indicating that there was more to the case than met the eye. He was certain that the solution to the mystery lay elsewhere, and that the truth would soon be revealed.",1
"The incident on the Underground, brushed off as mere chance, slipped from the public consciousness. But was it truly random? I harbored doubts. While the Tube mishap held a personal intrigue for me, there appeared to be a link between the two deaths. Both victims sported a sun-kissed complexion, indicating they were English expatriates, among other curious similarities. Intrigued by these peculiarities, I made a bold move. I marched into Scotland Yard, insisting on an audience with the lead investigator of the Mill House investigation.",1

Poirot, with his green cat-like eyes, remained calm and unmoving. ""So you don't believe it, doctor?"" ""Absolutely not. I trust in science, not superstition,"" the doctor stated firmly.",1
"I eagerly sipped from the straw until the glass was drained. The cold liquid slid smoothly down my throat, satisfying my thirst. Seated on a high stool by the counter, I noticed my pursuer entering and taking a discreet seat at a nearby table. After finishing my second coffee soda, I ordered a maple soda, enjoying the sugary sweetness. I have a high tolerance for ice-cream sodas, and can consume them endlessly. Unexpectedly, the man stood up and left the establishment. Intrigued, I quietly slipped off my stool and approached the door.",1
"Miss Marvell leaned forward, revealing a stone of white fire in her palm. Poirot examined it closely and advised her to leave it with him. She mentioned a deal with Lord Yardly to film a play at Yardly Chase. Lady Yardly arrived, revealing that she also received blackmailing letters about the diamond. Poirot decided to involve himself in the case and questioned Lord Yardly about his plans to sell the Star of the East. Lord Yardly explained his financial difficulties and the pressure to sell the jewel, despite Lady Yardly's opposition.",1
"We must trust that Mademoiselle Bella receives fair treatment, and ultimately Jack Renauld cannot wed both women. My words were purely professional. This is not a crime of precision and organization that a detective would appreciate. The elaborate setup orchestrated by Georges Conneau is flawless, but the resolution, oh no! A man accidentally killed in a moment of rage by a woman, really, where is the logic or structure in that? As I chuckled at Poirot's idiosyncrasies, Françoise entered the room. Poirot insisted on speaking with Mrs.",1

"""Get back to work,"" he commanded the chambermaid, who reluctantly obeyed. The inspector then locked the door behind her and proceeded to search Célestine. Despite the thorough search, nothing incriminating was found on her person. With a solemn expression, the inspector informed Célestine that she would still need to accompany him. Addressing Mrs. Opalsen, he apologized for the inconvenience, explaining that all evidence seemed to implicate Célestine. If the missing items were not on her, they must be concealed somewhere in the room.",1
"""I have heard rumors,"" I began cautiously, ""that you have ties to the government, possibly even working in the Secret Service. Is there any truth to that?"" There was a brief pause, almost imperceptible, before he responded. ""Let me assure you, Miss Bedford, that I am simply a tourist enjoying my own private travels."" Reflecting on his response afterwards, I couldn't shake the feeling of ambiguity. It seemed intentional. We returned to the car in silence, making a pit stop for tea at a rustic roadside cafe on our way back to Bulawayo.",1
"""The crime must have taken place approximately two hours later, giving anyone who left on that train a solid alibi!"" ""Brilliant, Hastings! You've got it!"" I jumped to my feet. ""We need to check with the station. They surely couldn't have missed two strangers leaving on that train! Let's go immediately!"" ""Do you really think so, Hastings?"" ""Absolutely. We should head there right now."" Poirot gently held me back with a touch on my arm. ""Go ahead if you must, my friend, but if you do, I wouldn't bother asking about those two strangers.""",1
"In some mysterious manner, I found myself in a perilous situation. There was a piece of information, real or perceived, that made others desperate to eliminate me, and it was somehow connected to the valuable diamonds. I was convinced that one individual, The Man in the Brown Suit named Harry Rayburn, held the missing puzzle piece. However, he had disappeared into the shadows, evading capture. It was unlikely that our paths would cross again. Shaking off sentimental thoughts of Harry Rayburn, I refocused on the present circumstances.",1
"Poirot pondered for a moment before speaking, ""The value of the diamond is significant. Greg sold it to you for far less than it is worth."" He paused, deep in thought. ""Hand me my almanac, Hastings,"" he requested. As I handed it to him, Poirot turned the pages, mumbling to himself. ""Ah, the full moon is on Friday next, in three days' time. Madame, I suggest you leave the diamond with me for safekeeping until then. This romantic tale may be a deception, but we cannot be certain. Let us wait until after Friday to decide our next move.""",1
"Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I had to find out if Chichester was on that boat. Whether to board it myself or not, I couldn't decide, but in the end I made up my mind to do so. Chichester had no idea that I had spotted him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would surely set more traps for me, but I was prepared. He was the one I was hunting, the one in search of the diamonds for the enigmatic “Colonel.” Unfortunately, as I reached the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was already sailing away from shore.",1
"""Because,” he exclaimed, “it is vital that I am there to witness its impact on me, just as it did on you.” “What?” I inquired. “Yes, to ensure my attendance! Upon reviewing the letter, he felt dissatisfied. It lacked the necessary force!” Pausing briefly, he continued with a glint in his eyes: “Hence, my friend, given that the postscript was not an impulsive addition, but a deliberate one, time is of the essence, and we must locate him without delay.” “Merlinville,” I pondered aloud. “The name sounds familiar.” Poirot simply nodded.",1
"He managed to get the case dismissed, but it destroyed the lives of two young men, staining their reputation as thieves. The father disowned his son, unable to bear the betrayal of the family name. The son, in his pride, remained silent, refusing to defend his innocence. Enraged, he enlisted in the war with his friend, who tragically lost his life due to reckless behavior. The father's bitterness towards a woman stemmed from his friend's deeper connection to her, leading to a series of events that awakened a sense of justice in him.",1

The magistrate was taken aback. ""Then what could it have been?"" Stonor's hand came down on the table with a resounding thud. ""Blackmail,"" he stated firmly. The magistrate was visibly startled. ""Blackmail,"" Stonor repeated.",1
"""Miss Pettigrew."" ""He wasn't exactly singing her praises just now,"" I observed. Pagett gave me a cold stare. ""She's a skilled shorthand typist,"" he stated firmly. As we arrived at the station, I thought he would depart. Extending my hand, I was surprised when he declined. ""I'll accompany you to see you off. It's only eight o'clock, your train departs in fifteen minutes."" Efficiently, he directed the porters. I stood frozen, avoiding eye contact with Suzanne. The man was suspicious. He was intent on ensuring that I caught the train.",1
"""Perhaps in the future, I could facilitate a marriage suitable for you."" ""I appreciate the offer,"" I chuckled, ""but marriage is not on my mind."" Poirot let out a sigh and shook his head. ""The English!"" he muttered. ""They rely too much on chance."" He furrowed his brow and adjusted the salt shaker. ""You mentioned Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at Hôtel d’Angleterre, correct?"" ""No, she's at Hôtel du Phare."" ""Ah, I stand corrected."" A brief moment of doubt crossed my thoughts. Had I disclosed the hotel information to Poirot before?",1
"""Ugh, this blasted sand!"" ""Oh come now, Belgium has plenty of sand,"" I pointed out, recalling a vacation in Knocke-sur-mer surrounded by ""les dunes impeccables"" as the guidebook described. ""Not in Brussels,"" Poirot stated firmly. He stared at the Pyramids pensively. ""It's true that they, at least, have a solid and geometrical shape, but their uneven surface is rather displeasing. And those palm trees, I cannot stand them. They don't even plant them in straight rows!"" I interrupted his complaints, proposing that we head to the camp.",1
"""Witnessed by the two maids, Denise and Françoise. Nothing particularly unusual about that.” He handed it over. “Maybe,” started Bex, “you didn't observe ” “The date?” sparkled Poirot. “Oh, but I did. A fortnight ago. Maybe it signifies his first hint of danger. Many wealthy men pass away without a will by never thinking about the possibility of their death. However, it's risky to jump to conclusions too soon. Nevertheless, it indicates his genuine affection and love for his wife, despite his romantic affairs.” “Indeed,” replied M.",1
"He refrained from entering, opting instead to linger near the bench mentioned earlier, positioned a short distance from it. After a brief contemplation, he walked cautiously from the bench to the hedgerow separating Villa Geneviève from Villa Marguerite. He retraced his steps, nodding in approval. Moving back to the hedgerow, he pushed aside the bushes with his hands. ""If luck is on my side,"" he whispered to me, ""Mademoiselle Marthe might be in the garden. I need to speak with her without drawing attention at the Villa Marguerite.""",1
"The man's death is under investigation. Madame Daubreuil is questioned about her relationship with him, but she denies any involvement. Madame Daubreuil is characterized as yielding yet seductive, and she insists on being present during the questioning. The examining magistrate insinuates that she may have known more than she lets on, but she remains defiant and refuses to cooperate, ultimately kicking them out of her house. The magistrate and Poirot part ways, with Poirot commenting on the thoroughness of the French police system.",1
"""You see, Anne, Sir Eustace has been cleared of all charges. His guilt is certain, despite some technicalities. There is nothing to prevent you from being together now."" His voice was hesitant as he spoke, avoiding eye contact. ""I am aware,"" I responded with relief. ""And there is no obstacle to him reclaiming his true identity immediately."" ""Indeed, there is not."" ""Do you know his true name?"" The question caught me off guard. ""Yes, I do. It's Harry Lucas."" His silence in response felt unsettling, leaving me with a sense of unease.",1
"""Excuse me, sir, but was that a usual habit of his?” “No, it was not, however, old Françoise holds the common belief about the English being eccentric and capable of unpredictable actions! While going to fetch her mistress, a younger maid, Léonie, was shocked to find her tied up and gagged, and at the same time, news arrived that M. Renauld’s lifeless body had been found, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most bizarre aspects of the situation. Mr. Poirot, the body was discovered lying face down in an open grave.""",1
"""My dear friend, do not let your mind wander. Recall the partially torn cheque and the name Bella Duveen, faintly recognized by Stonor. It is safe to say that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack's mysterious correspondent, the one who visited Villa Geneviève that fateful night. We cannot be sure if she sought Jack or his father from the start, but it seems likely. She presented her demands to Jack, possibly revealing incriminating letters, prompting the older man to offer payment with a cheque. This she defiantly ripped apart.""",1
"""She doesn't know him at all."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Absolutely."" ""You don't see any resemblance to the attackers?"" ""No,"" she paused, considering. ""No, I don't believe so. They had fake beards, as the magistrate mentioned, but still no."" Then she made up her mind. ""I'm positive neither of them was this guy."" ""Alright, ma'am. That's all."" With her head held high, she walked out, the sunlight gleaming on her silver hair. Jack Renauld followed, also unable to recognize the man, in a completely nonchalant manner. Giraud simply grunted.",1
"""They were both dressed in dark coats with hats pulled low over their eyes."" The magistrate paused, eyeing them suspiciously. ""Too much facial hair,"" he muttered. ""Are they impostors?"" questioned the woman. ""Indeed,"" confirmed the magistrate. ""Please, go on with your account."" She continued, ""The smaller of the two grabbed me, shoving a cloth in my mouth before tying my hands and feet with rope. Meanwhile, the other intruder loomed over my husband, brandishing my small dagger from the vanity table dangerously close to his chest.""",1
"He grasped my arm tightly. ""I've made a fool of myself, my dear friend! I could hear the love and sorrow in her voice, my little theory was completely off. Well, I must rethink everything!"" The doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman inside. The police inspector watched them, sighing. ""Poor woman,"" he muttered. ""The trauma was too overwhelming for her. There's nothing we can do now. Shall we go to the crime scene, M. Poirot?"" ""Yes, let's, M. Bex."" We made our way through the house and exited through the front entrance.",1
"It was clear that out of several hundred applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Elsa Hardt and her partner, from New York, took the flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson to escape the Mafia or the Camorra. They offered the flat at a low rental to attract a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson. The plan was to strike when the avenger arrived. Poirot deduced this scheme and saved them from being hanged. The house was watched, and the police were on their way. Our beautiful lady will not escape.",1
"Pagett clearly wants me to do it. And I have to deal with Caroline. It's hard to believe that anyone would stay in England during winter! The weather here is just terrible. This situation is really frustrating. The house agents are saying it will be nearly impossible to rent out the Mill House now that it's been in the news. Caroline is satisfied with double the pay. We could have just sent her a message from Cannes. Honestly, there was no reason for us to come here in the first place. I'll be heading back tomorrow. The next day.",1
"We shut the door behind us as Harry positioned himself next to the window with a view of the landing-stage. A boat was approaching, drawing closer. ""Who goes there?"" Harry's voice echoed loudly. Our suspicions about our uninvited guests were quickly confirmed. Bullets rained down around us, but miraculously we remained unscathed. Harry gripped the rifle tightly, firing with deadly accuracy. Two cries and a splash followed. ""That should give them pause,"" he muttered, grabbing a second rifle. ""Stay clear, Anne, and reload swiftly.""",1
"""Upon receiving his assurance, we bid him farewell. True to his word, a hastily written message arrived the next day around eleven. It simply read, 'The Dulcibella Sisters performing at the Palace in Coventry. Best of luck.' Without hesitation, we immediately set off for Coventry. Poirot opted not to investigate at the theater, instead choosing to secure seats for the variety show that night. The performance turned out to be dreadfully tedious, leaving me to wonder if it was truly the show or simply my own dismal state of mind.""",1
"Despite the excruciating pain and my inability to shield my face, I struggled to maintain a specific course. I found myself spinning in all directions except the one I desired. Eventually, I reached my target, nearly brushing it with my tied hands. Yet, the task was far from simple. It required an eternity to maneuver the glass into a suitable position against the wall to rub against my restraints. The painstaking process nearly broke my spirit, but I persevered until I finally managed to cut through the ropes binding my wrists.",1
"I asked her, ""Don't you think this is sufficient? It's going to be quite horrifying and distasteful."" There was a strange expression on her face that I struggled to understand. Suddenly, she burst into laughter. ""I have a taste for the macabre,"" she declared. ""Let's go."" We made our way to the shed in complete silence. As I opened the door, we stepped inside. Approaching the body, I delicately uncovered it just as M. Bex had shown me the day before. A soft gasp escaped from the girl's lips, causing me to glance in her direction.",1
"The clever heroine always found herself in the clutches of the Master Criminal, facing death in unusual ways. Fortunately, the hero always came to her rescue just in time. One day, Papa was in a frenzy over the discovery of an ancient skull. He insisted on an immediate trip to explore the area, despite financial concerns. Papa's focus on science clashed with practical matters, leaving Anne to sort out the details. The prospect of an adventure in Rhodesia excited Anne, but she couldn't help noticing her father's mismatched boots.",1
"""The calm demeanor of handling situations didn't sit right with me. ""If you don't object,"" I began, pausing for a moment. ""Not at all. You want to conduct your own investigation, correct?"" ""I'd actually prefer to observe Giraud, if he happens to be around, and see what he's doing."" ""The human bloodhound,"" Poirot muttered, reclining in a cozy chair and shutting his eyes. ""Feel free, my friend. Goodbye."" I exited through the main entrance. The heat was quite intense. I headed down the same path we had traversed the previous day.""",1
"After committing the crime, the killer had to disguise himself to avoid detection. He had to wear a false beard and wig, and sleep separately from his wife to avoid suspicion. The gardener's sighting of the killer sneaking around the house was indeed true. The killer disposed of his clothes in the lake and pawned the stolen ring to divert attention. The unexpected phone call about a murder at Count Foscatini's flat led to a chilling discovery - the victim was found dead at his writing table, struck by a brutal blow to the head.",1
"I gasped in horror at the sight of the airplane dagger. Maître Grosíer immediately interjected, insisting on speaking to his client before any questions were answered. Jack Renauld, however, disregarded Grosíer's pleas and calmly confirmed, ""Yes, I recognize it. It was a gift from me to my mother, a reminder of the War."" When asked about the possibility of a duplicate dagger, Jack confidently stated, ""To my knowledge, there is none. The design was unique to me."" The magistrate was taken aback by the audacity of Jack's response.",1
"Not forgetting the mysterious visitor from the previous night, I made a mental note to locate him on the ship before the day was out. My attention was drawn to the following individuals as they seemed significant: (1) Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of Mill House, whose appearance on the Kilmorden Castle was quite unexpected. (2) Mr. Pagett, the secretary with a sinister demeanor, who had shown great interest in securing Cabin 17. Note: Investigate his connection to Sir Eustace's journey to Cannes. (3) Reverend Edward Chichester.",1
"He appeared to be around fifty years old, his once dark hair now peppered with strands of grey. With a clean-shaven face, his long, narrow nose and closely set eyes gave him a stern appearance. The deep bronzed complexion hinted at a life spent under tropical suns. As his lips curled back in a grimace of shock and fear, Poirot noted, ""It's clear from his expression that he was attacked from behind."" With great care, he rolled the lifeless body over, revealing a dark stain between the shoulder blades on the light fawn overcoat.",1
"His expression remained unchanged, a smirk playing on his lips. ""I have my eye on those diamonds,"" he declared. I shook my head. ""You won't be getting your hands on them,"" I retorted. ""Oh, but I will. Let's not beat around the bush. A few bodies turning up in this part of town wouldn't raise any eyebrows. There's a guy downstairs who takes care of those messy situations. Now, let's be reasonable. Write a letter to Harry Rayburn. Tell him to come here, diamonds in tow."" I stood my ground. ""I refuse to comply with your demands.""",1
"I was taken aback by the sudden appearance of the mysterious woman in my compartment. She was young, with a face covered in powder and lips painted an impossibly bright red. Her impudent demeanor and shocking language made me frown, but her infectious laughter soon broke through my reserve. Despite her unconventional behavior, I found myself unable to resist her charm. With a toss of her head, she declared us friends and demanded an apology for her missing sister. I obliged, feeling strangely drawn to this rebellious stranger.",1
"Poirot calmly analyzed the situation as Japp burst in with a sense of urgency. There was a burglary, jewels and money involved, and the culprit seemed to have made a clever escape plan. Poirot, with his keen eye for detail, explained his theory while enjoying his breakfast. Japp pressed for answers on the whereabouts of the criminal. Poirot, unfazed, hinted at a hiding place that showcased the brilliance of the criminal mind. The conversation turned to the best escape strategy, with Poirot's companions offering their opinions.",1
"Walking away from each other after a tense exchange, I strolled along Edgware Road (the meeting had occurred in a St. John’s Wood residence) and through Hyde Park towards St. George’s Hospital. Upon arriving, I made my way into Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and purchased a ticket for Gloucester Road. Standing on the platform, I proceeded to the far end. Curiosity drove me to confirm the existence of points and an aperture connecting the two tunnels past the station towards Down Street. To my satisfaction, I was proven correct.",1
"… I barely had time to entertain the chilling thought that had crossed my mind before Jack Renauld entered the room. Poirot greeted him with a professional demeanor. ""Please, have a seat, sir. I apologize for the inconvenience, but you must understand that I find the atmosphere of the Villa quite unpleasant. M. Giraud and I have differing opinions on several matters. His lack of courtesy towards me has not gone unnoticed, and I have no intention of sharing any findings with him."" ""Of course, M. Poirot,"" replied the young man.",1
"""Hautet, removing his hat, “we deeply apologize for the intrusion, but you understand the requirements of the Law? Please convey my regards to Madame your mother, and would she kindly spare me a brief moment for a conversation.” The girl hesitated briefly, her left hand clutching her side to calm the overwhelming turmoil in her heart. Eventually, she regained composure and whispered, “I'll check. Please, follow me.” Leading him into a room on the left side of the hallway, we could hear the faint murmur of their conversation.""",1
"""He was securely locked up for the night in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course.""",1
"""I chose to hire Harry as my secretary instead of turning him in to the authorities,"" she explained. ""I was after those accursed diamonds. Nadina, that sneaky little vixen, was pitting your Harry against me. If I didn't meet her demands, she threatened to sell the gems back to him. It was a miscalculation on my part. I assumed she would have them on her that day, but she was more cunning than I anticipated. To make matters worse, her husband Carton was also deceased, leaving me clueless as to the whereabouts of the diamonds.""",1
"""Shall we go down together, Hastings, and lend an ear to our guest's particular issue? Please extend my apologies."" Roger Havering, a man in his forties, stood tall with a sharp appearance, yet his face betrayed signs of distress. ""Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s associate, correct? It is absolutely crucial that he accompany me to Derbyshire today."" ""I'm sorry, but that's not feasible,"" I responded. ""Poirot is bedridden with the flu."" Havering's expression darkened. ""Oh dear, that is a significant setback for me.""",1
"""We caught up with Cinderella and headed swiftly towards Villa Geneviève. Poirot cast a glance back at the lighted window, observing Marthe's profile as she worked diligently. 'He's under watch, no doubt,' he whispered. Upon reaching Villa Geneviève, Poirot positioned himself discreetly behind some foliage to the left of the driveway, granting us a clear view while remaining unseen. The Villa was shrouded in darkness, its occupants likely asleep. We found ourselves right beneath Mrs. Renauld's open bedroom window in no time.""",1
"""Why must they be cleaned? Do I parade myself on the front like a young man? On Sundays I wear the Sunday boots, of course, but other times!"" he shrugged. I shook my head, disheartened. ""Well, well,"" the magistrate said. ""We are not making much progress. We are surely waiting on the return cable from Santiago. Has anyone seen Giraud? Honestly, that one lacks manners! I am tempted to summon him and-"" ""You won't have to look far, M. le juge."" The calm voice surprised us. Giraud stood outside, peering in through the open window.",1
"A nervous wreck, poor thing. I've done what I could to shield her, but the shock was inevitable."" ""You were treating Mr. Maltravers recently?"" ""My dear sir, I never treated him."" ""What?"" ""I believe Mr. Maltravers followed Christian Science or a similar belief."" ""But you conducted the examination?"" ""Indeed. I was summoned by a gardener."" ""And the cause of death was evident?"" ""Undoubtedly. Blood on the lips, but the majority of bleeding internally."" ""Was the body left undisturbed?"" ""Yes, untouched from where it was discovered.""",1
"At the sensation of the icy water, he jolted awake and sat upright. ""Stay put, please,"" I instructed. He was the type of young man who recovered quickly from a shock. Pushing himself up, he stood unsteadily. ""No need for assistance, thank you,"" he declared defiantly, with a hint of aggression. Not a hint of gratitude or manners! ""That's quite a nasty gash. Let me help bandage it up."" ""Absolutely not,"" he retorted, throwing the words at me as if I had been the one asking for a favor. My temper, always simmering, began to boil.",1
"I saw that I would be intercepted before reaching the platform I sought. Glancing at the clock, it showed one minute until eleven. If my scheme worked, I could pull it off. I had used the main entrance on Adderly Street to access the station. Now, I swiftly exited through a side door. Across from me stood the post office's side entrance, the primary one being on Adderly Street. As predicted, instead of pursuing me inside, my pursuer ran down the street to intercept me at the main entrance, or to signal the policeman to do so.",1
"""After indulging in soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of beef, and a rice soufflé, the time was just around eight o’clock. Unfortunately, the plates and dishes had already been washed up. The question of finger-prints did not concern Poirot, rather, he was intrigued by Count Foscatini's appetite. Did the Count consume every dish? The answer was affirmative, although the quantity remained unknown. The plates were dirty and the dishes empty, except for the rice soufflé, of which a considerable portion remained.""",1
"""Eight years he's been by my side, a loyal companion indeed,"" my acquaintance grinned. ""But we seem to be talking past each other. I'm talking about the woman."" ""Miss Pettigrew?"" I gasped.

It might just be superstition, or perhaps a curse from the past that works in mysterious ways. Nevertheless, three deaths! And I am scared, Monsieur Poirot, very scared. This might not be over yet.” “Who are you worried about?” “My son.”",1
"After listing off dates, prices, and names of unfamiliar places, they finally finished checking and counting. ""Excellent,"" declared Chichester, the scraping of his chair indicating his departure. ""I will bring these to show the 'Colonel'."" ""When are you leaving?"" ""Ten o'clock tomorrow morning works for me."" ""Do you wish to visit the girl before your departure?"" ""No. It's strictly forbidden for anyone to see her until the 'Colonel' arrives. Is she doing well?"" ""I peeked in on her during dinner. I believe she was fast asleep.""",1
"Colonel Race was determined to see Sir Eustace face the consequences of his actions. Given Sir Eustace's network of spies and agents in Jo'burg, it was no surprise he had managed to escape. Colonel Race doubted they would ever be able to capture him, especially considering his well-thought-out escape plan. Despite my reservations, I nodded along as Colonel Race discussed the situation. The conversation fell quiet until Colonel Race inquired about Harry, to which I replied that he had left at dawn and I hadn't seen him since.",1
"""Can you estimate his height? Maybe around six feet?"" ""I believe so."" ""He was completely clean-shaven, correct?"" ""Yes, not a trace of a moustache."" ""Did his chin have a shiny appearance?"" I inquired suddenly. Mrs. James gazed at me in astonishment. ""Come to think of it, miss, it did. How did you know?"" ""Interestingly, murderers often have shiny chins,"" I declared excitedly. Mrs. James took my word seriously. ""Is that so, miss? I had no idea."" ""Did you notice anything distinctive about his head?"" ""Just a regular head, miss.""",1
"""Have your officers been wandering around here haphazardly? I assumed they were more competent these days.""""Indeed they are. The footprints you're referring to were actually left by the workers who found the body.""The man grunted in frustration.

The number itself seemed to haunt the protagonist, triggering memories of past events. With a sense of urgency, they retrieved a valuable document hidden among rolled stockings. The significance of the number 17 weighed heavily on their mind, especially in relation to a crucial date linked to the Kilmorden Castle's departure. What if their interpretation was flawed?",1
"Papa’s circle consisted of elderly Professors, each sporting a lengthy beard. I recall a particular encounter with Professor Peterson, who once complimented my ""neat little waist"" before attempting to kiss me. His outdated phrasing revealed his true age. I longed for excitement, love, and passion, yet found myself trapped in a mundane existence. The village had a worn lending library, where I indulged in tales of adventure and romance, falling asleep to dreams of bold Rhodesians and men who triumphed effortlessly in combat.",1

Pagett's behavior is quite mysterious these days. Just to provoke him, I will inquire with the girl. As I mentioned earlier, she has exceptionally attractive legs.

"""But the 'Colonel' prefers to work alone, not allowing anyone else to interfere."" His words triggered a memory that clearly bothered him. ""He is seeking information from this girl."" There was a slight hesitation before the word ""information,"" prompting the Dutchman to inquire further. ""Information?"" ""Something along those lines."" ""Diamonds,"" I whispered under my breath.

But he was no businessman.” I was well aware of that fact, maybe even more so than Mr. Flemming, but I held my tongue. He went on: “You likely don’t grasp these matters. Let me clarify.” He went into unnecessary detail. The end result was that I was left to navigate life with only £87, 17s. 4d. It felt disappointingly insufficient. Anxiously, I braced myself for what would come next.",1
"As the men gathered in the hall for breakfast, their voices echoed up the stairs, causing me great unease. I knew I had to remain patient in order to find a way out of the house without being caught. After breakfast, I heard the sounds of Chichester leaving, and to my relief, the Dutchman followed suit. Waiting anxiously, I took note as breakfast dishes were cleared and the household chores commenced. Finally, as the commotion subsided, I cautiously emerged from my hiding spot and stealthily made my way down the staircase.",1

"I fulfilled my assignment successfully, making sure to collect payment upfront. I meticulously planned every detail, knowing this would be my final job before leaving the business. As for your reference to burning bridges, I must admit I am at a loss.

Soon enough, I will likely be discovered bound and in a desperate state of fear and hunger, once the timing is right.",1

Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.' I inquired about his thoughts on the case as we exited the gruesome chamber. 'Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!' he said, acknowledging my astonishment. 'Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past.'""",1
"""Poor Maltravers! You had no idea, I gather, that he was discovered with a crowbar next to him."" ""So you're saying my tale influenced him - oh, that's terrible!"" ""Don't worry, it would have happened regardless. Now, I need to make a call to London."" Poirot had an extensive discussion on the phone, returning with a pensive expression. He disappeared on his own for the rest of the afternoon, only reappearing at seven o’clock to reveal that he could delay it no more, and had to deliver the tragic news to the grieving widow.",1
"Engrossed, I found myself slightly uplifted. My focus shifted to the passengers. A woman caught my eye. Around thirty years old, of average height, she had a round face with dimples and striking blue eyes. Her attire, while simple, exuded a certain Parisian elegance. There was a subtle air of authority as she effortlessly commanded the deck stewards. She had a designated deck-chair, along with a never-ending stack of cushions. Despite changing her mind multiple times on its placement, she maintained her allure and grace.",1
"I never fooled myself into thinking that it held any significance. It was likely just a passing fancy. Nevertheless, I had the ability to intrigue her. She was a woman who had encountered the typical thrills of life. I intended to introduce her to an exceptional one! I admired her; admired her relaxed demeanor, her absence of emotional exaggeration, her sincerity. I was determined. I resolved to find her at that moment. She probably hadn't retired for the night. But then I realized that I was unaware of her cabin number.",1
"Part of me was horrified by the sudden tragedy, while another part of me observed with detached interest the efforts to rescue the man from the electrified rail. ""Excuse me, please. I am a doctor."" A tall man with a brown beard pushed his way through and knelt beside the lifeless body. A strange feeling of surrealism washed over me as I watched. It felt almost unreal. After a moment, the doctor stood up and grimly declared, ""He's gone. There's nothing more to do."" We all gathered closer, and a distressed porter spoke up.",1
"""For example, if the killers sought revenge, why not simply stab Renauld while he slept and be done with it?"" ""They were after the 'secret',"" I pointed out. Poirot flicked a speck of dust off his coat sleeve with a dissatisfied expression. ""But where is this 'secret'? It must be some distance away, as they made him get dressed. Yet his body was discovered murdered nearby, almost within earshot of the house. Furthermore, it seems too convenient for a weapon like the dagger to be casually lying around, easily accessible.""",1
"""I'll get the scoop from my contact in Livingstone about the hotel and your pals' whereabouts,” I assured her. “Beira,” I muttered. “That's your destination, Anne. Let me handle this.” Our conversation had provided a brief break from the intensity of the situation, but tension swiftly returned. Without exchanging glances, we reached a silent agreement. “Fine,” I replied, retreating into the hut. Resting on the animal-hide sofa, sleep eluded me as I listened to Harry Rayburn's restless steps outside throughout the night.",1
"""If you find the location to your liking, I suggest you put in an offer. Would you like me to draft an order for you?"" ""Yes, please."" Fifteen minutes later, I arrived at the entrance of the Mill House. When I knocked, the door swung open and a tall woman in her middle years practically jumped out. ""No one is allowed inside the house, do you understand? I've had my fill of reporters. Sir Eustace has given strict orders"" ""I was under the impression the house was available for rent,"" I stated coldly, handing over my order.",1
"""Is it possible? My husband was the most absent-minded man."" Her brow furrowed slightly as she mentioned this particular flaw in her late husband. The commissary interjected, ""I believe there is an important conclusion to be drawn here. The fact that the men required M. Renauld to dress himself suggests that the location they intended to bring him, where 'the secret' was hidden, was quite a distance away."" The magistrate agreed, ""Indeed, not too close, but also not too far, considering he expected to return by morning.""",1
"“No,” Poirot declared with a firm shake of his head, “the culprit must be Dr. Ames.” The doctor gaped at him in disbelief, then echoed Dr. Tosswill’s words, exclaiming: “Someone is playing a trick on us. Let’s go, we’ll apprehend the perpetrator soon.” With determination, he sprinted after the elusive figure. I trailed behind, yet despite our thorough search, we discovered no signs of any individual passing through. Upon our return, Poirot was already busy implementing his unique methods to guarantee his own protection.",1
"""Pas du tout,” said Poirot firmly. “She sought my help on the advice of Mary Cavendish. Upon learning that Mary Marvell, her enemy, had visited, she quickly changed her mind, seizing the opportunity presented by your words. A brief interrogation revealed that you had mentioned the letters to her, not the other way around. She eagerly embraced the chance your words provided.” “I find that hard to believe,” I retorted, feeling offended. “Si, si, mon ami, it is regrettable that you do not study psychology,"" replied Poirot.",1
"Anne Beddingfeld was tired of the monotony of her life. Her father, Professor Beddingfeld, was completely engrossed in studying Primitive Man, leaving Anne to handle the practicalities of everyday life. She despised anything related to Palaeolithic Man, despite her involvement in typing and revising her father's work on Neanderthal Man. The absence of her mother since childhood added to the sense of sameness in her life. But Anne always longed for some excitement, a break from the mundane routine that consumed her days.",1
"As he spoke, he flung the door wide and we stepped inside. The chamber M. Renauld had designated as his personal sanctuary was compact, yet adorned with exquisite elegance. A practical writing desk, complete with numerous compartments, occupied the corner by the window. Across from the fireplace, two expansive armchairs clad in leather beckoned, encircling a circular table adorned with the newest publications. Rows of books adorned the walls, while a splendid oak sideboard with a tantalus graced the far end of the room.",1
"Lord Estair confirmed that the Prime Minister was under police protection, with his chauffeur being an Irishman from County Clare named O’Murphy. The Prime Minister's car deviated from the main road and was ambushed by masked men, but managed to escape with only a slight wound. Despite the incident, the Prime Minister continued on to Charing Cross and then departed for France. However, the police later found the Prime Minister's car parked outside a suspicious restaurant in Soho, known to be frequented by German agents.",1
"The silence was eerie, broken only by the rumble of our car, a vintage Ford that looked like it had seen better days. The upholstery was in tatters, and even my limited knowledge of engines told me that something was seriously wrong under the hood. As we drove on, the landscape transformed, with massive boulders rising up in surreal formations. It felt as though we had wandered into a prehistoric world, where giants once roamed. Lost in thought, I glanced at Colonel Race and murmured, ""There must have been giants once.""",1
"""Approximately fifteen minutes later, a tall man with a thick black moustache arrived at the front door claiming to have an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. Identifying himself as Mr. Lowen, he was escorted to the study per the banker's request. Nearly sixty minutes elapsed with no sign of Mr. Davenheim. Frustrated, Mr. Lowen rang the bell, indicating his need to depart in order to catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim, puzzled by her husband's absence despite expecting the visitor, apologized for the situation.""",1
"""Mademoiselle, would you mind showing me once more the actions you described earlier? You were here working, correct?"" Célestine sat, stood up, went to the next room, picked up an item from the dresser, and came back. Poirot watched her closely, also keeping an eye on his bulky pocket watch. ""Could you do it one more time, please?"" After the repeat performance, he jotted something down in his notebook and put the watch away. ""Thank you, mademoiselle. And to you, sir,"" he nodded at the inspector, ""for your cooperation.""",1
"""The truth is undeniable. But how did you come by this information?"" Marthe questioned with a hint of embarrassment. Poirot's face twisted in displeasure. ""Secrecy is non-existent in cases like this! However, it makes no difference. So, what are you curious about, mademoiselle?"" After a moment of hesitation, the girl finally gathered the courage to ask, almost in a hushed tone: ""Has anyone been singled out as a suspect?"" Poirot observed her intently before responding vaguely, ""Suspicions are circulating, mademoiselle.""",1
"I looked at Race, a sudden urge to delve deeper into his story taking hold of me. ""Who would be considered Sir Laurence's closest relative, Race? Any idea?"" His smile was knowing. ""That would be me,"" he declared. (Anne's Story Continued) The evening of the masquerade ball marked a turning point for me. I realized it was time to share my burden with someone. Until then, I had relished working alone. But now, everything was different. Doubt clouded my mind, and a sense of isolation seeped into my soul for the first time.",1
"Inadvertently, Mademoiselle Marthe revealed the truth about another matter, contradicting Jack Renauld in the process. His noticeable pause when questioned about seeing Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime raised suspicions of deceit. To confirm my doubts, I needed to speak with Mademoiselle Marthe before Jack could warn her. Just three simple words from her provided the crucial information I sought. When I inquired if she was aware of Jack Renauld's presence that night, her response was simply, ""He informed me.""",1
"""I noticed the letters were not delivered by post,"" she remarked. ""No, they were hand-delivered by a Chinaman. It's unsettling,"" he replied.“Why is that?”""Because Gregory purchased the stone from a Chinese man in San Francisco three years back.""“So, you suspect the diamond in question is ‘The Western Star’?” she inquired.“Yes, that's correct. Gregory recalls there was a mysterious tale linked to the stone, but the Chinese man refused to share any details. He appeared terrified and eager to part with it,” he explained.",1
"""Indeed, she certainly has a past! Though not as young as before, I have observed men turning their heads as she passes by. Recently, she seems to have more money to spare, a fact well-known in town. The days of penny-pinching are over."" With an air of absolute conviction, Françoise shook her head. M. Hautet pondered, stroking his beard. ""And what of Madame Renauld's reaction to this companionship?"" he inquired. Françoise simply shrugged. ""She has always been pleasant and polite. It's as if she is completely unaware.""",1
"""It's a beautiful and consoling thought, isn't it? You can go now, but be cautious. Ah, he's left! My friend Hastings stares at me with reproachful eyes. It was all so simple! It was evident right from the start that out of the numerous applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions, only the Robinsons were deemed appropriate. Why? What was it that made them stand out from the others almost immediately? Their appearance? Maybe, but it wasn't that unique. Their name, then!"" ""But the name Robinson is quite common,"" I exclaimed.",1
"""The woman had been dead for about twenty-four hours, according to the police surgeon. Despite The Daily Budget's assumption that the man in the Tube was responsible for her murder and subsequent suicide, the timeline proved otherwise. The woman was alive at three o’clock, while the Tube victim was already dead by two o’clock. Therefore, it was clear that the two events were unrelated. The discovery of an address to view a house in Marlow in the dead man's pocket was simply a coincidence, a common occurrence in life.""",1
"At six, my father passed away. Eight years later, my mother joined him in the grave. The only kin left was my Uncle Andrew, who acquired Crabtree Manor after returning from Australia. Despite his kindness, he had firm beliefs in women's education, opposing 'book knowledge.' Our arguments were endless, especially when I won a scholarship to Girton. His will left me a year to prove my wits, challenging me to unravel the mystery of the manor. With Poirot's help, the hunt began, uncovering hidden secrets in the old house.",1
"Blair welcomed the idea, mentioning that if I were murdered, it would be a terrific scoop for Anne. Tomorrow, we will pass through Bechuanaland, where the dust will be atrocious. At each station, Kafir children sell quaint wooden animals they carve themselves, along with mealie bowls and baskets. Mrs. Blair seems captivated by the primitive charm of these toys. Friday evening arrived, and my fears were confirmed - Mrs. Blair and Anne purchased forty-nine wooden animals. My journey to Rhodesia was thoroughly enjoyable.",1
"Poirot took the lead as we left the town, making our way towards the Villa Geneviève. However, upon reaching the Villa Marguerite, he stopped abruptly. ""I must ensure that Jack Renauld is safe. Hastings, accompany me. Perhaps Mademoiselle should stay outside. Madame Daubreuil's words may be hurtful."" We opened the gate and proceeded up the pathway. Turning the corner of the house, I pointed out a window on the first floor to Poirot. Projected on the blind was the silhouette of Marthe Daubreuil. ""Ah!"" exclaimed Poirot.",1
"“Hey, Bex!” he shouted. “Come take a look at this. There’s plenty of clues here for you.” The commissary approached and grinned. “Poirot, my friend, those footprints clearly belong to the gardener’s big hobnailed boots. And besides, it doesn’t matter much since there are no trees on this side, hence no way to access the upper floor.” “Fair point,” Poirot replied, looking disappointed. “So you believe these footprints are insignificant?” “Absolutely not.” To my surprise, Poirot then uttered: “I beg to differ with you.",1
"As I watched the examining magistrate immerse himself in the unfolding mystery, Poirot inquired about M. Giraud's absence. ""Will M. Giraud be joining us?"" he questioned. M. Hautet responded curtly, ""M. Giraud has made it clear that he prefers to handle the case on his own terms."" It was evident that the examining magistrate was not swayed by Giraud's disrespectful behavior. Without further discussion, we proceeded in silence. Poirot walked alongside the examining magistrate, while the commissary and I trailed behind.",1
"Cinderella was standing in the doorway, her breath coming in little gasps. She asked me why I was in Coventry and if the man with me was a detective. As she spoke, her stage dress cloak slipped from her shoulders, revealing her fear. I reassured her, holding her close as she wept bitterly. It was she who took the dagger, afraid of leaving fingerprints. I promised not to give her up to the police, confessing my love for her. She was shocked, asking what I knew. I recounted her visit to Mr. Renauld and the torn cheque.",1
"I met her eyes squarely. ""Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.""",1
"“Then, naturally, we must ascertain our current situation. What was the time of Mr. Schneider’s passing?” “Three days prior.” “You are certain it was tetanus?” “Absolutely certain.” “There is no possibility of it being strychnine poisoning, correct?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I understand your concern. But it was undoubtedly tetanus.” “Were anti-serums administered?” “Indeed they were,” the doctor replied curtly. “We exhausted all possible measures.” “Did you have the anti-serum on hand?” “No. We obtained it from Cairo.",1
"“To uncover the truth behind his patient's demise, but a hemorrhage appears to be the likely cause. However, we must conduct further investigations. Get your bag ready in five minutes, Hastings, and we'll catch a taxi to Liverpool Street.” After an hour, we stepped off a train from the Great Eastern at the small Marsdon Leigh station. Gathering information there revealed that Marsdon Manor was approximately a mile away. Choosing to walk, Poirot and I proceeded down the main street. ""What's our strategy?"" I inquired.",1
"As I approached Lord Nasby's residence, my heart raced with a mixture of determination and fear. The plan to confront him had been brewing inside me for days, fueled by the memory of our disastrous interview. Normally, such a bold move would be out of character for me, but in that moment, anger propelled me forward. Lord Nasby, the wealthy media mogul behind the Daily Budget, was about to face the consequences of his actions. With each step towards his front door, I steeled myself for the confrontation that awaited.",1
"Every single person was incredibly nice to me. Despite my state of confusion, I was grateful for their kindness. I didn't feel a deep sense of sorrow. My father had never shown me love, that much I understood. Had he shown me affection, perhaps I would have reciprocated. There was no love between us, but we were connected, and I had taken care of him, silently admiring his intelligence and unwavering dedication to science. It pained me that my father passed away at a time when life held the most fascination for him.",1
"I sensed Harry's gaze before he even spoke. ""You resemble a witch, Anne,"" he finally uttered, his tone carrying an unfamiliar weight. His hand extended, barely brushing my hair, sending a shiver down my spine. Abruptly, he stood up with a curse. ""You need to depart by tomorrow, do you understand?"" he exclaimed. ""I can't endure this any longer. I am merely human. You have to go, Anne. It's imperative. You're no simpleton. Deep down, you realize this is unsustainable."" ""I guess not,"" I replied, deliberating each word.",1
"The solution did not appeal to me, because, as I mentioned to you, Hastings, a skilled detective like myself enjoys facing a worthy adversary. However, one must deal with crimes as they are, not as one wishes them to be. It was unlikely that Bella Duveen would be walking around with a souvenir paper-knife in hand, but perhaps she had been planning revenge on Jack Renauld all along. Even when she confessed to the murder, something felt off. I couldn't shake the feeling of unease, my friend. Unease lingered within me.",1
"""I don't have cash on hand,"" Papa appeared frustrated. ""My dear, I don't want to deal with these money matters. The bank told me yesterday that I have a twenty-seven pound overdraft."" ""That sounds like your overdraft,"" I suggested. ""Oh, I remember! Contact my publishers."" Papa's books were more renowned than profitable. The thought of traveling to Rhodesia excited me. ""Serious men,"" I whispered in delight. Suddenly, something about my father's look seemed off. ""You're wearing mismatched boots, papa,"" I pointed out.",1
"He quickly disposes of her and then proceeds to his task. Leaving the front door open slightly to create a misleading trail for the assassins, he secures Madame Renauld, ensuring she is unable to raise suspicion. The night air is cold as he covers his underclothes with an overcoat, planning to dispose of it along with the deceased. Carefully smoothing over the flower bed, he exits through the window, leaving incriminating evidence behind. As he ventures out onto the desolate golf course, he digs a grave and then...",1
"""The evidence in both cases clearly points to the same conclusion."" ""So, you're suggesting that Madame Beroldy escaped justice? That she was, in fact, involved in her husband's murder?"" I gazed at him in disbelief. ""Absolutely! Don't you agree?"" Poirot paced to the far end of the room, absentmindedly adjusting a chair before speaking slowly. ""Indeed, that is my belief. However, it's not a certainty, my dear friend. Legally speaking, Madame Beroldy is not guilty."" ""Of that specific crime, maybe. But not of others.""",1
"Célestine vehemently denied the accusations, claiming she never saw the pearls. The inspector, however, remained suspicious and decided to search her. Despite finding nothing, Poirot proposed a little experiment. Célestine reluctantly agreed and repeated her actions of fetching a reel of cotton and scissors from her room. Poirot observed closely, making notes in his pocket-book. After the experiment, Célestine was cleared of suspicion, leaving the inspector to search the room thoroughly to find the missing pearls.",1
"Poirot instructed the boy to ask at the cloak-room about the valise left by two foreigners on the night of the murder. The boy agreed to do so, and Poirot advised him to go straight to the station without returning to the Villa. Poirot then questioned Jack Renauld about his whereabouts on the night of the crime, pointing out inconsistencies in his story. Renauld hesitated before admitting he was in Merlinville. Poirot followed Renauld discreetly, realizing that Renauld fell for his trick about the mythical valise.",1
"Renauld turned to the magistrate and expressed his regrets: “I should have discussed this with my husband, but I believed it was just a passing fancy that would fade away faster if we ignored it. Now I see my mistake, but at that time, my husband was so preoccupied and troubled, acting unlike himself, that I wanted to spare him any extra burden.” M. Hautet acknowledged her words. “And when you disclosed your plans with Mademoiselle Daubreuil to your father,” he continued, “was he shocked?” “He was utterly stunned.",1
"“You confided in me during our train ride back from Paris about your Italian heritage and a past incident involving it. There was mention of a threatening letter sent to Jack Renauld. Upon encountering him, a surge of anger and jealousy overwhelmed you, leading to a fatal act. While you may not have intended to take his life, Cinderella, you are responsible for his death.” With hands shielding her face, she whispered, “You’re correct... I understand now, it’s all clear.” Abruptly, she fixed me with a fierce gaze.",1
"""Ames, the professional accompanying the expedition, and Hassan, my husband's loyal native servant."" ""Can you recall the name of the American secretary?"" ""Harper, I believe, but I'm not certain. He hadn't been with Mr. Bleibner for very long. He was quite a pleasant young man."" ""Thank you, Lady Willard."" ""Is there anything else?"" ""Not at the moment. Trust me to handle it now, and rest assured I will do everything in my power to safeguard your son."" Lady Willard seemed unsettled by his less-than-reassuring words.",1
"""Madame, may I?"" He accepted the jewel, examining it closely before handing it back with a nod. ""A truly flawless gem. Ah, heavens! And to think you carry it with you, like this!"" ""No, no, I am very cautious, Monsieur Poirot. Normally, it is secured in my jewel case, kept in the hotel safe. We are staying at the Luxurious, you see. I only brought it today for your inspection."" ""And you will entrust it to me, will you not? You will heed the advice of Papa Poirot?"" ""Well, you see, Monsieur Poirot, it's like this.""",1
"""But Madame Daubreuil has vanished. The authorities are on the hunt for her."" ""Do you think she was involved with her daughter?"" ""We may never find out. Madame is skilled at keeping her secrets. I highly doubt the police will locate her."" ""Has Jack Renauld been informed?"" ""Not yet."" ""This news will hit him hard."" ""Indeed. However, I suspect his feelings were never deeply invested. While we viewed Bella Duveen as a temptress and Marthe Daubreuil as his true love, I believe the opposite may be closer to reality.""",1
"He made a stop at a small cottage hospital to get his wound treated before continuing on to Charing Cross, where a special train was ready to take him to Dover. Captain Daniels provided a brief account of the incident to the police before the man departed for France. Upon arrival in Dover, he boarded a waiting destroyer, and in Boulogne, a counterfeit car with the Union Jack awaited him. ""Is that all?"" inquired the listener. ""Yes,"" replied the man. ""Although, there is one rather odd detail that I must mention.""",1
"I suggested they may have departed on the midnight train, but he firmly dismissed the notion. He was confident he would have noticed two foreigners among the twenty or so passengers that left. I couldn't pinpoint what triggered my suspicion, perhaps the anxious tone of Marthe Daubreuil. Suddenly, I inquired: ""Young M. Renauld, he didn't board that train, did he?"" ""No, sir. Arriving and departing within half an hour is hardly entertaining,"" he replied. The man's words held a deeper meaning that almost eluded me.",1
"Jack rushed to catch his train in Paris after retrieving his bag from the library. Léonie shared a story about his anger, but the details of the dispute remained a mystery. Poirot decided to wait in the salon while I ventured out to find Giraud. As I made my way through the dense shrubbery, I unexpectedly collided with Cinderella, who seemed eager to explore the crime scene at Villa Geneviève. Despite my reservations, she insisted on seeing all the gruesome details, leaving me unsettled by her morbid curiosity.",1
"""Now, based solely on the information we have discussed, I estimate the time of death to be the morning of June 7th."" His words left me in shock. ""How could you possibly be certain?"" I questioned. ""The only way to make sense of the sequence of events is by this conclusion. I have guided you through the facts, can you not see the truth now?"" ""I'm afraid I'm still lost,"" I admitted. Poirot's expression turned melancholic. ""It is truly unfortunate. Your intellect shows promise, yet lacks the necessary structure.""",1
"""Poirot's gaze bore into him, his eyes slitted like a cat's, revealing only a glint of green. ""Then it seems there is a peculiar error, one that even the station staff share. They claim you disembarked from the 11:40 train."" Jack Renauld hesitated briefly, then resolved to speak. ""And if I did? Surely you're not suggesting I had a hand in my father's demise?"" His tone was proud, chin lifted. ""I demand to know why you are here."" ""It's quite straightforward. I came to visit my betrothed, Mademoiselle Daubreuil.""",1
"""We headed to the opposite side of the deck, where a sparkling white pinnacle rose in the distance, draped in a soft rose-coloured mist. Delighted, I couldn't help but exclaim. Mrs. Blair rushed to grab her camera. Despite Colonel Race's sarcastic remarks, she continued snapping away: “This is the last shot. Oh,” her tone shifted to disappointment, “I accidentally had it on ‘bulb’ the whole time.” “I always enjoy watching a child with a new toy,” the Colonel remarked. “You're so mean, but I have another roll.""",1
"A short time later, I found myself face to face with a stranger in the study. He had a muscular build and a sun-kissed complexion. An unmistakable scar stretched from his eye to his jaw, marring an otherwise attractive yet daring face. ""So,"" I began, ""what brings you here?"" ""Mr. Milray has instructed me to assist you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your aide."" ""I already have a personal assistant,"" I replied. ""I have no need for another."" ""I beg to differ, Sir Eustace. I believe you do.""",1
"Carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a precise line, a satisfied grin on his face. Time ticked by. The Opalsens remained absent. ""Interesting,"" I commented, breaking the silence. ""I wonder when they'll reappear."" Poirot observed the smoke spiraling upwards before stating, ""They won't be returning."" ""But why?"" I inquired. ""What makes you so sure?"" Poirot's smile widened. ""Just a while back, the manager dashed out of his office and hurried upstairs. Clearly, something has gone amiss.""",1
"I simply requested daily reports and obedience to my wired instructions, to which you agreed. Shortly after, I found myself across from Mr. Havering on a first-class carriage of the Midland Railway, swiftly departing from London. Firstly, Captain Hastings, it is essential that you grasp the fact that Hunter’s Lodge, the location of the tragic event, is merely a small shooting-box nestled in the Derbyshire moors. Our primary residence is near Newmarket, while we typically lease a flat in town during the season.",1
"She leaned forward, her hand opening to reveal a stone of white fire set in platinum. Poirot marveled at its flawlessness. Miss Marvell explained that they were going to Yardly Chase, where a film deal was in the works with Lord Yardly. Lady Yardly arrived, revealing that she too had received mysterious letters about her diamond. Poirot decided to intervene by contacting Lord Yardly. Lord Yardly confessed his financial troubles and his plan to sell the Star of the East. Lady Yardly disagreed with his decision.",1
"I heard her voice next, clear and sharp, tinged with a hint of an exotic accent: ‘Marlow, The Mill House. Belongs to Sir Eustace Pedler. I think it might be just right for me. I'll pay a visit.’ The man handed her a note and she sauntered out, exuding an air of royalty. She didn't acknowledge Carton in any way, yet I had a feeling their encounter was planned. My mind raced with assumptions. Unaware that Sir Eustace was in Cannes, I suspected this house hunt was a ruse to rendezvous with him at the Mill House.",1
"Rayburn was crouched next to the man sprawled out near the saloon entrance. I rushed over, out of breath, and asked, ""Did you have to hit him?"" Rayburn's response was cold, ""No need. He was already like this when I found him. Or maybe he's faking. Let's find out who he is."" Anxious, I edged closer. It was clear that the man who attacked me was much larger than Chichester. Unlike Chichester, who was weak and flabby, this man seemed capable of using brute force. Rayburn lit a match, and we both gasped in shock.",1
"""It adds up, also, to M. Renauld's effort to appease her with a check. I believe I will be able to locate her easily with the aid of this."" He then revealed the picture he had removed from Jack Renauld's desk. ""With affection from Bella,"" was written in messy handwriting in the corner, but that was not what captured my attention. The quality of the image was not the best, yet it was undeniably familiar to me. A chill ran down my spine, as if a terrible disaster had struck me. It was the visage of Cinderella.",1
"Renauld will fly to Paris, where he will lie low until the time comes for him to join his wife in a foreign country under assumed names. They have planned it all meticulously, down to the smallest detail. But fate has other ideas. The tramp's death sets off a chain of events that they could never have predicted. And now, as Poirot unravels the truth, the shocking reality of their carefully laid plans comes to light. Will justice be served, or will their cunning scheme succeed in the end? Only time will tell.",1
"Suzanne and I were strategizing about our targets. Mr. Chichester heading to Durban, Sir Eustace to Cape Town and then Rhodesia. Colonel Race was also on his way to Rhodesia. The plan was to keep an eye on them all. However, danger struck when I was attacked on deck. My mysterious rescuer turned out to be the man with the scar. Another shadow joined in, revealing the identity of my assailant - Guy Pagett. The discovery left us all stunned. Suspicion hung heavy in the air, with secrets waiting to be revealed.",1
"We made it to shore safely, though my wet clothes clung uncomfortably to my body. Despite the rough terrain ahead, we had to press on towards Livingstone. The journey was grueling, with my skirts tearing on thorns and my stockings long gone. Eventually, I had to stop from sheer exhaustion. Harry, ever the gentleman, offered to carry me for a while. And so, I found myself arriving in Livingstone draped over his shoulder like a piece of luggage. How he managed to carry me all that way, I will never understand.",1
"""All women do."" ""Will they be practicing low jumps?"" I inquired, chuckling. ""No, I'm afraid not. I need to head to Durban."" Sir Eustace glanced at me, let out a heavy sigh, then opened the door to the next room and called for Pagett. ""If you're done with your nap, my friend, how about working for a change?"" Guy Pagett entered the room. He nodded to both of us, looking surprised at the sight of me, and responded in a somber tone: ""I've been typing that memo all afternoon, Sir Eustace."" ""Then stop typing it.""",1
"""Are you Hassan, the former servant of Sir John Willard?"" ""I was in service to Sir John, now I am in service to his son."" He moved closer, speaking softly. ""You have a reputation for knowledge in the supernatural. Advise the young master to leave. There is malevolence surrounding us."" Without waiting for a response, he walked away abruptly. ""Malevolence in the air,"" murmured Poirot. ""I sense it too."" Our dinner was somber. Dr. Tosswill dominated the conversation with a lecture on ancient Egyptian artifacts.",1
"""Blair greeted me on deck, beckoning me to sit beside him. 'Good morning, Gipsy girl,' he said, noting my tired appearance. I questioned his use of the nickname, to which he explained, 'It suits you somehow. I've always thought of you that way. It's the gipsy element in you that sets you apart.' I found it amusing that we both considered each other to be the most interesting company on board, excluding Colonel Race. 'You're such an exquisitely finished product,' I remarked, mirroring his earlier sentiment.""",1
"""I don't believe that,” Poirot said with a mysterious grin. “I know it's the hair of a woman, and not just any woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I declared confidently. “Maybe,” Poirot replied, giving me a curious look. I kept my composure. “What's our next move?” I inquired, as we stepped into the foyer of the Villa Geneviève. “I plan to investigate M. Jack Renauld's belongings. That's why I needed to keep him occupied for a while.” “Won't Giraud have already done a search?” I questioned skeptically. “Certainly.",1
"""Isn’t it true that women worship strength, almost like ancestor worship?” “It’s quite true if we’re honest. You may think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, it’s the physical that matters. Living in primitive conditions would make it acceptable, but that’s not the case. In the end, the other side triumphs. The things that seem defeated always prevail in the end, don’t they? They win in the most important way. It’s like what the Bible says about losing your soul and then discovering it.""",1
"""Pedler was deceived into thinking Rayburn was his new secretary, not Mr. Pagett,"" Suzanne whispered anxiously, her hand squeezing mine under the table. ""But where is Rayburn now?"" I held my breath, eager for an answer. ""He's vanished without a trace,"" came the reply. ""And Sir Eustace?"" Suzanne inquired. ""He sees it as a direct affront from Fate."" Later that day, we were interrupted from our nap by a note delivered by a page-boy, providing us with a chance to hear Sir Eustace's perspective on the situation.",1
"""The dagger is missing!"" ""What do you mean missing?"" ""Gone. Poof. The glass jar holding it is now empty."" ""No way,"" I exclaimed. ""I swear I saw it this morning."" My words fell silent. All eyes in the room turned to me. ""What's this about seeing it this morning?"" demanded the officer. ""Yes, this morning,"" I confirmed. ""An hour and a half ago, to be exact."" ""So you went to the shed? How did you get the key?"" ""I got it from the sergeant,"" I admitted. ""And why did you go there?"" I hesitated, then confessed. ""M.",1
"As we journeyed through the vast and ever-changing landscapes, there was always something fascinating to behold. From the breathtaking beauty of the Hex river valley to the haunting desolation of the Karoo, and finally the endless straight path in Bechuanaland. At each stop, which barely resembled a station, a swarm of natives emerged from the barren surroundings, offering their handmade treasures. Suzanne was captivated, quickly starting a collection of the intricately carved wooden animals they presented.",1
"At the stroke of one o’clock, I was certain that something would occur. Throughout the night, I could hear my fellow passengers retiring to their cabins. Bits of conversation and laughter drifted in through the transom before all fell silent. The majority of the lights extinguished, leaving only a faint glow from the lone light in the corridor. As the sound of eight bells resonated through the ship, the ensuing hour felt interminable. I discreetly checked my watch, anxious not to miss the anticipated event.",1
"He appeared kind and fatherly, treating me as a naive girl facing a cruel world. There was no use arguing. I knew my father, a great but poor man, left me with a disappointing inheritance. Mr. Flemming suggested I stay with them, an opportunity I eagerly accepted. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me warmly, as I tried to make myself look like the stereotypical orphan. Despite my doubts about my appearance, I was determined to find a job. My reflection in the mirror didn't seem to match the compliments I had received.",1
"He stared at me with a smile, suggesting I had erred. I denied it vehemently. “This roll is unexposed,” he pointed out. I left with a shred of dignity. It’s a humbling experience to realize one’s own foolishness. Yet no one savors that revelation. Suddenly, a model of the “Kenilworth Castle” caught my eye at the shipping office. An idea struck. I entered and inquired about the “Kilmorden Castle.” The ticket was exactly the amount of my inheritance. I opted for first class, sealing my fate on this adventure.",1
"The local investigators have scoured the area for any clues. Every possible effort is being made, yet Anne Beddingfeld remains missing. The prevailing belief is that she wandered in a sleep-like state. Traces along the trail by the bridge suggest a deliberate step off the cliff. If true, her fate would have been a tragic fall onto the jagged rocks beneath. Regrettably, the majority of the tracks were erased by a group of sightseers who passed through that morning. This explanation leaves much to be desired.",1
"""His demeanor remained composed as he penned the letter, yet in a sudden burst of emotion, he hastily wrote those four frantic words."" Disagreeing, my companion vigorously shook his head. ""You are mistaken. Can you not see that while the signature ink is dark, the postscript ink is faint?"" Perplexed, I replied, ""And?"" ""Ah, my friend, engage your intellect! Is it not clear? M. Renauld composed his letter, read it over without smudging, then, with intent, included those final words before blotting the page.""",1
"""It wasn’t merely the monetary worth of the discovery that captivated them, Eardsley had wealth in his future and Lucas was accustomed to poverty. Rather, it was the pure joy of finding something new.” There was a brief silence before he continued, almost hesitantly: “I hope you don’t object to me recounting the story in this manner, almost as if I wasn’t a part of it. That’s how it feels now, reflecting on those two youngsters. It’s easy to overlook the fact that one of them happened to be Harry Rayburn.""",1
"""Let's not risk it. I'll catch the next train out of here. I don't want Giraud sniffing around the Villa."" ""Understood. Head straight to the station,"" Poirot instructed. As Renauld prepared to leave, Poirot interjected, ""Wait a minute, M. Renauld. There's something that doesn't add up. Why keep your presence in Merlinville a secret from M. Hautet?"" Renauld's face turned red, but he quickly regained his composure. ""You must be mistaken. I clearly stated to the magistrate that I was in Cherbourg that night.""",1
"""The films that disappeared through the vent on the 22nd, remember? How do you know they were the originals? Who would go through the trouble of returning them that way in the dead of night? It doesn't make sense. They were a warning, the films had been swapped out of the yellow tin case, replaced with something else. Do you still have it?"" ""I might have used it. Wait, found it. I think I left it on the shelf by the bed."" She handed it over. Just a regular round tin, like the ones used for tropical films.""",1
"""The insurance policy, that's what this is about, correct? But why must I deal with this now?"" ""Stay strong, Madame. Stay strong! Your husband had a substantial life insurance policy, so the Company needs to verify some information. They've given me the authority to represent them. I promise to make this process as painless as possible for you. Can you please tell me what happened on Wednesday?"" ""I was getting ready for tea when my maid informed me that one of the gardeners had urgently come to the house.""",1
"“There comes a point where a man is given the opportunity to hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Indeed, indeed.” “The strikers are not the root of the issue. They are being orchestrated by an unknown entity. Weapons and bombs have been flooding in, and we have uncovered crucial documents that reveal the strategies used to bring them in. There is a specific code. Potatoes signify ‘detonators,’ cauliflower represents ‘rifles,’ while other produce indicates different types of explosives.” “Fascinating,” I remarked.",1
"Ventnor, who had stayed in cabin C 24 adjacent to Philip Ridgeway's, had intrigued me with Poirot's deductions about his existence and appearance. Eagerly, I inquired if Ventnor was among the first to disembark in New York, only to learn he was actually one of the last. Disheartened, I watched Poirot's amused expression as he thanked the steward and we left. Frustrated, I pointed out how the information contradicted Poirot's theory, but he simply grinned and remarked, ""As usual, you see nothing, Hastings.""",1
