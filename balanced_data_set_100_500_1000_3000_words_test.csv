"Just as he approached him, the man glanced quickly up and down the street, then took a small item from his pocket and tossed it over the fence before continuing on to the station. The 'chink' of the object hitting the ground piqued the interest of a man in the ditch, who found a ring. Kellett claims this story, but Lowen denies it vehemently. There is a possibility that he encountered Davenheim in the lane, but Poirot finds it highly unlikely. Japp agrees, noting that Lowen's actions seem odd. Poirot suggests that the ring could have been planted near the scene. Japp mentions a lime kiln nearby that could have been used to dispose of the body. Poirot contemplates the situation, leaving Japp and the narrator puzzled.",1
"The man tending to the garden was clearly agitated by our presence, but begrudgingly agreed to assist us. After an unbearable delay, he presented us with some stale pastries and lukewarm tea before retreating back to his gardening. As soon as he left, a swarm of hungry cats surrounded us, meowing incessantly. Feeling sorry for the starving creatures, I offered them bits of cake which they devoured eagerly. Pouring what little milk we had into a saucer caused the cats to fight over it ferociously. ""They're clearly malnourished!"" I exclaimed in outrage.",1
"As we approached the town of Merlinville, a sense of unease crept over me. My companion, with a grave expression, muttered about a looming disaster that he could not quite explain. Despite my skepticism, his words left a chill in the air. He hinted at a big affair, a complex problem that would not be easily resolved. Just then, we reached Merlinville and sought directions to the Villa Geneviève. A local pointed us in the right direction, guiding us through the town towards our destination.",1
"With a cry of terror piercing the night, the girl vanished through the window, her wrists like steel. Poirot, impatient, brushed Françoise aside and hurried down the passage to the other maids. The door was locked from the inside, but a heavy fall was heard. Eventually, Cinderella opened the door to reveal Mrs. Renauld gasping for breath on the bed. She had been nearly strangled. Poirot examined a silk rope ladder - a means of escape. Meanwhile, a figure lay dead on the ground, revealed to be the beautiful Marthe Daubreuil. Confused memories flooded my mind as Poirot reprimanded Françoise for not disclosing Mrs. Renauld's change of room. The chaos culminated in Poirot demanding the doctor for Mrs. Renauld and then the police.",1
"As Giraud laid his hat on the table and prepared to deliver his lecture on detective work, Poirot settled in to listen attentively. Giraud confidently outlined his case against Jack Renauld, detailing the motives and means that led to his arrest. But Poirot, with a glint of mischief in his eye, interjected with a crucial detail that Giraud had overlooked. The two men engaged in a battle of wits, each trying to outsmart the other with their theories and deductions. As they walked towards the sea to review the case, Poirot guided Hastings towards the truth with his characteristic cryptic remarks. It was a challenging and exhilarating intellectual exercise, where every detail mattered, and every clue led them closer to unraveling the mystery.",1
"""So, what do we know about Rayburn? He's got a scar, sure, but that could easily be a fake. He fits the height and build profile though. Can you remember the details of the head you described to the police at Scotland Yard?"" My heart raced. Suzanne was intelligent and well-educated, but I hoped she wasn't familiar with the technical jargon of anthropology. ""Dolichocephalic,"" I replied casually. Suzanne seemed uncertain. ""Are you sure?"" ""Absolutely. It means long-headed, with a width less than 75 percent of its length,"" I explained smoothly. There was a moment of silence.",1
"Poirot's conversation with the doctor turned to the ancient beliefs of Egypt, causing tension among the group. Despite the doctor's skepticism, Poirot's interest in the supernatural was evident. As they explored the excavations, a sense of unease lingered in the air. Hassan, a servant, warned Poirot of evil spirits present and urged the young master to leave. The sighting of a shadowy figure resembling Anubis, the god of departing souls, heightened the group's fear. Dr. Ames and Sir Guy attempted to catch the mysterious figure but found no trace of its existence. Poirot, unfazed by the events, focused on ensuring his safety in his own unique way.",1
"""After the bonds went missing from the trunk, a thorough search of the ship was conducted but yielded no results. It was discovered that the stolen bonds were sold in small parcels shortly after the ship docked in New York. This led to suspicions falling on Mr. Ridgeway. He was then searched and questioned, but the mystery remained unsolved. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Monsieur Hercule Poirot and his friend Captain Hastings decided to pay a visit to the Bank. Upon arrival, they were escorted to a small office where they met the joint general managers, Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, both of whom had dedicated their lives to the service of the Bank.""",1
"” I tried to follow his instructions, reviewing every aspect of the investigation. After careful consideration, it became apparent to me that Giraud's theory, which Poirot dismissed, was the most logical explanation. Contemplating further, I realized that the key to the puzzle likely lay with Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was unaware of her involvement in the Beroldy Case, a detail Poirot emphasized as crucial. Focused on this new lead, I felt a surge of hope. Then, a sudden burst of inspiration struck me, causing me to tremble as I pieced together a new theory.""",1
"“You instructed me to secure Cabin 17,” Pagett hesitated, evoking memories of bravery in the face of danger. With a hint of irritation, I responded, “I simply noted that No. 17 was available. But there was no need for you to defend it as if your life depended on it. Cabins 13 or 28 would have sufficed.” His expression turned pained. “There is something more,” he persisted. “Miss Beddingfeld was assigned the cabin, yet this morning I witnessed Chichester exiting it discreetly.” I fixed him with a stern gaze. “If you are trying to stir up baseless rumors about Chichester, a missionary albeit a disagreeable one, and the charming Anne Beddingfeld, I refuse to entertain such gossip,” I stated coolly. “Anne Beddingfeld is a delightful young lady with exceptional legs. I dare say she possesses the finest legs aboard.” Pagett was clearly uncomfortable with my mention of Anne Beddingfeld’s legs. He was not one to notice legs himself, or if he did, he would never admit it. Additionally, he viewed my interest in such matters as frivolous. Enjoying his discomfort, I continued mischievously, “Now that you have made her acquaintance, why not invite her to join us for dinner at our table tomorrow evening? It is the Fancy Dress ball, after all. And do visit the barber to select a costume for me.” “Surely you are not considering attending in fancy dress?” Pagett exclaimed in horror. It was evident that such a notion clashed with his perception of my dignity. He appeared scandalized and distressed. Although I had not originally planned on wearing fancy dress, the opportunity to disconcert Pagett was too enticing to resist. “What do you mean?” I retorted. “Of course I shall dress up. And so will you.” Pagett recoiled in horror. “Go to the barber and make the arrangements,” I concluded. “I doubt they will have sizes to accommodate my stature,” Pagett remarked, eyeing me critically. Unintentionally, Pagett could be quite tactless on occasion. “And reserve a table for six in the dining hall,” I instructed. “We shall invite the Captain, the lady with the lovely legs, Mrs. Blair—” “You will not secure Mrs. Blair’s company without Colonel Race,” Pagett interrupted. “He has already asked her to dine with him.” Pagett seemed to possess knowledge of everything. I was understandably irritated. “Who is this Race?” I demanded, frustrated. As I had mentioned earlier, Pagett always seemed to be in the know. He assumed a mysterious demeanor once more. “They say he is a Secret Service agent, Sir Eustace. Quite a prominent figure. But I cannot confirm it.” “Typical of the Government, isn’t it?” I exclaimed. “They entrust secret documents to a civilian, when all he desires is to be left in peace.” Pagett adopted an even more secretive air, moving closer and lowering his voice.",1
"So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection: “Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will doubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that Madame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had taken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me ” I saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice: “I shall not contradict you. It is possible.” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back. “M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried. “Yes, but I forbid ” “My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of Mr. Renauld.”",1
"""I remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent. I assisted him with a Japanese wrestler. He can help us find what we need to know. It took time to find him. He agreed to help. Aarons knows a young girl named Bella Duveen. She is a performer. The Dulcibella Kids are her sisters. They are in Coventry at the Palace. Poirot booked tickets for the show. The sisters performed well. Bella Duveen, now Cinderella, confessed to taking the dagger. She feared being caught. I comforted her and confessed my love. She was surprised and asked why I wouldn't turn her in. I reassured her of my love and understanding. She was relieved and asked what I knew.""",1
"The furniture and house had finally been sold off, managing to cover our outstanding debts. Despite my efforts, I had yet to secure a job. Truth be told, I wasn't exactly eager to find one! I firmly believed that if I sought out adventure, it would come to me. In my experience, one's desires always come to fruition. And soon enough, my belief was put to the test. It happened on a cold January 8th, right after an unsuccessful meeting with a woman seeking a secretary-companion, though it seemed she really needed a laborer willing to toil twelve hours a day for a measly £25 per year.",1
"“Always stay vigilant for danger,” Mr. Rayburn warned me, his voice filled with urgency. “And remember, if you ever find yourself in their grasp, honesty may be your only salvation.”His words sent a shiver down my spine. “Your caution is unsettling, Mr. Rayburn,” I admitted, my heart racing with unease. “But why go to such lengths to protect me?”Mr. Rayburn fell silent, his expression grave. After a moment, he spoke softly, almost as if to himself: “This may be the final favor I can offer. Once ashore, I will be safe, but reaching land is not guaranteed.”“What do you mean?” I exclaimed, my mind reeling with the implications. “Are you suggesting that my knowledge of your identity as 'The Man in the Brown Suit' puts us both in jeopardy?”",1
"""Informant, I must insist."" We had reached the stairs leading to the entrance of the Mansion. Inside, another officer was waiting. When the chief arrived, he asked for the whereabouts of Mr. Hautet. ""He's in the living room, sir."" Mr. Bex opened a door on the right, and we followed. Mr. Hautet and his assistant were seated at a large rectangular table. They glanced over as we stepped in. The chief introduced us and explained the reason for our visit. Mr. Hautet, the Investigating Judge, was a tall man with sharp eyes and a well-groomed grey beard that he stroked while speaking.",1
"""I’d rather die than be tough,” I declared fervently. We hopped in the car and set off. I gathered myself slowly. Out of the blue, he held my hand. “Anne,” he said softly, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was shocked. “Oh, no,” I stuttered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t have feelings for you in that way. I never saw you like that.” “I understand. Is that the only reason?” I had to be truthful. I owed him that. “No,” I replied, “it's not. I care for someone else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true from the start when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?” “No,” I murmured. “It has been since then.” “I see,” he repeated for the third time, but now there was a determined tone in his voice that made me look at him. His face was more serious than ever before. “What do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, unreadable, commanding. “Only that I now know what I must do.” His words sent a chill down my spine. There was a resolve in them that I couldn't comprehend and it scared me. Neither of us said another word until we reached the hotel. I went straight to Suzanne. She was lounging on her bed reading and seemed unaffected, not at all like she had a headache. “Here lies the perfect gooseberry,” she joked. “Also known as the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what's wrong?” I burst into tears. I told her about the cats but felt it wasn't right to tell her about Colonel Race. Suzanne is very perceptive. I think she sensed there was more to it. “You haven't caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds ridiculous to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep shivering.” “It's nothing,” I replied. “Just nerves or a feeling that something terrible is about to happen.” “Don't be silly,” Suzanne said firmly. “Let's talk about something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds.” “What about them?” “I'm worried they're not safe with me. It was fine before, no one would have thought they'd be among my things. But now that everyone knows we're such good friends, you and I, I'll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they're in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It's a great hiding spot and I don't think we could find a better one.” She agreed reluctantly, but said we'd revisit the topic when we got to the Falls. Our train departed at nine o'clock. Sir Eustace was still in a bad mood, and Miss Pettigrew seemed subdued. Colonel Race was his usual self. I felt like I had dreamt the whole conversation on the way back. I slept deeply that night on my hard bunk, battling with vague, menacing dreams. I woke up with a headache and went out to the observation platform of the car. It was cool and beautiful, with rolling wooded hills as far as the eye could see. I adored it, more than any other place I'd been to. I wished I could have a little hut in the heart of the scrub and live there forever. Just before half past two, Colonel Race called me out from the ""office"" and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist hovering over part of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he explained. “We're almost there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream-like feeling of elation that followed my troubled night. I strongly felt that I had come home. Home! And yet I had never been here before or had I in dreams? We walked from the train to the hotel, a large white building protected against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We stepped out onto the veranda and I gasped. Half a mile away, facing us, were the Falls. I'd never seen anything so magnificent and beautiful, and I never will. “Anne, you're strange,” Suzanne commented as we sat down for lunch. “I've never seen you like this before.” She looked at me curiously. “Am I?” I laughed, but it felt forced. “It's just that I love it all.” “It's more than that.” A slight frown of concern crossed her forehead. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that, I had the odd sensation that I was waiting for something, something that would happen soon. I was excited, restless. After tea, we went out, hopped on the trolley, and were pushed by smiling locals down the rails to the bridge. It was a remarkable sight, the vast chasm and the rushing waters below, the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted occasionally to reveal the waterfall and then closed up again in its mysterious allure. That, to me, has always been the allure of the Falls—their elusive nature. You always think you're about to see something, but you never do. We crossed the bridge and strolled along the path marked with white stone on either side, leading around the gorge. Finally, we reached a large clearing where a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it for tomorrow? It's quite a climb up again.” “We'll leave it for tomorrow,” Sir Eustace decided. He's not keen on strenuous physical activities, I've noticed. He led the way back. As we passed, we saw a native followed by a woman carrying an assortment of household items piled on her head, including a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I need it,” moaned Suzanne. “That's an opportunity that will present itself often enough, Mrs. Blair,” Colonel Race assured her. “So don't be upset.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we venture into the rainbow forest?” he asked. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I joined him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I found the rainbow forest somewhat disappointing. There weren't enough rainbows, and we ended up soaked, but every now and then, we caught a glimpse of the Falls and realized how incredibly wide they are.",1
"""After identifying the sole doctor in Marsdon Leigh as Dr. Ralph Bernard, we arrived at his residence. Situated slightly off the main road, the house appeared to be a refined cottage. The doctor's name was displayed on a brass plate attached to the gate. As we walked up the path and rang the bell, luck was on our side. We caught Dr. Bernard during his consulting hour, with no patients in queue at that moment. Dr. Bernard, an elderly man with a slight stoop and genial demeanor, welcomed us. Poirot, introducing himself, outlined the purpose of our visit, emphasizing the necessity for Insurance Companies to conduct a thorough investigation in such cases.""",1
"A big sedan is parked on the deserted street, looking like it's having mechanical issues. The driver waves for O’Murphy to pull over. As O’Murphy decelerates, the stranger comes closer. Daniels sticks his head out of the window, and, likely using a fast-acting anesthetic like ethyl chloride, executes the chloroform scheme once more. In no time, the two vulnerable men are hauled out and switched to a different vehicle, while two replacements seamlessly take their spots.",1
"I have been taken into custody, mother."" ""What?"" She let out a shrill scream, and before anyone could reach her, she swayed and collapsed heavily. We hurried to her side and raised her up. Shortly after, Poirot got back on his feet. ""She has suffered a severe head injury, on the edge of the staircase. I suspect there is also a minor concussion. If Giraud requires a statement from her, he will have to be patient. She will likely be unconscious for at least a week."" Denise and Françoise had rushed to their mistress, and with them in charge, Poirot departed from the residence. He walked with his head bowed, furrowing his brow as he pondered the situation. I remained silent for a while, but eventually, I dared to ask him a question. ""Do you then believe, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Jack Renauld might be innocent?"" Poirot did not respond immediately, but after a long pause, he spoke solemnly: ""I am unsure, Hastings. There is a slight possibility. Of course, Giraud is entirely mistaken. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is not due to Giraud's arguments but in spite of them. And the most serious accusation against him is only known to me."" ""What is that?"" I inquired, intrigued. ""If you were to engage your brain cells and see the whole picture as clearly as I do, you would also recognize it, my friend."" This was one of Poirot's frustrating replies that I had grown accustomed to. He continued without waiting for my response. ""Let us walk towards the sea. We will sit on that small mound there, overlooking the shore, and reassess the situation. You shall be informed of all the details I possess, but I would prefer you to uncover the truth through your own efforts rather than me guiding you every step of the way."" We settled on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested, gazing out at the sea. The cries of bathers in the distance reached our ears faintly. The ocean was a pale shade of blue, and the tranquil calm reminded me of our arrival at Merlinville, my high spirits, and Poirot's suggestion that I was ""fey."" It felt like an eternity had passed since then. In reality, it had only been three days. ""Concentrate, my friend,"" Poirot's voice encouraged. ""Organize your thoughts. Be methodical. Be systematic. That is the key to success."" I tried to follow his advice, recollecting all the intricacies of the case. Reluctantly, it seemed that Giraud's solution, which Poirot dismissed, was the only clear and plausible one. I pondered once more. If there was a glimmer of hope anywhere, it was towards Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was unaware of her involvement in the Beroldy Case. Poirot had emphasized the significance of the Beroldy Case. That was where I needed to focus. I was on the right path now. And suddenly, an astonishingly bright idea flashed into my mind. Shaking, I constructed my theory. ""You seem to have a notion, my friend! Excellent. We are making progress."" I sat upright and lit a pipe. ""Poirot,"" I began, ""it appears that we have been neglectful. I say we, even though I suspect I am more at fault. But you must bear the consequences of your secrecy. So I reiterate, we have overlooked someone."" ""And who might that be?"" Poirot asked, his eyes twinkling. ""Georges Conneau!"" In the next moment, Poirot embraced me warmly. ""Finally! You have reached a conclusion. And all on your own. It is marvelous! Continue your train of thought. You are correct. Undoubtedly, we erred in forgetting Georges Conneau."" I was so flattered by the little man's approval that I could barely continue. But eventually, I gathered my thoughts and proceeded. ""Georges Conneau vanished twenty years ago, but there is no evidence to suggest that he is deceased."" ""None at all,"" Poirot agreed. ""Go on."" ""Therefore, let us assume he is still alive."" ""Precisely."" ""Or that he was alive until recently."" ""Even better!"" ""Let us suppose,"" I continued, my excitement growing, ""that he has fallen on hard times. He has turned to a life of crime, become an apache, a vagabond, or whatever you wish to call it. By chance, he arrives at Merlinville. There, he encounters the woman he has always loved."" ""Ah, the sentimentality,"" cautioned Poirot. ""Where there is hatred, there is also love,"" I quoted or misquoted. ""Regardless, he finds her there, living under an assumed name. However, she now has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, memories of past grievances resurfacing, clashes with Renauld. He ambushes him as he visits his paramour and stabs him in the back. Subsequently, terrified by his actions, he begins to dig a grave. I believe it probable that Madame Daubreuil emerges to search for her lover. She and Conneau engage in a heated argument. He drags her into the shed and suddenly suffers an epileptic seizure. Now, if Jack Renauld were to appear. Madame Daubreuil discloses everything to him, highlighting the dire consequences for her daughter if this old scandal is revived. His father's killer is deceased; they should strive to keep it under wraps. Jack Renauld agrees, proceeds to the house, and converses with his mother, persuading her to see his perspective. Armed with the narrative that Madame Daubreuil has proposed, she consents to be silenced and restrained. So, Poirot, what are your thoughts on this?"" I reclined, flushed with the satisfaction of my reconstructed scenario. Poirot regarded me thoughtfully. ""I believe you should write for the Kinema, my friend,"" he remarked finally. ""You mean?"" ""It would make a compelling film, the tale you have recounted to me, but it bears no resemblance to reality."" ""I admit I have not delved into all the specifics, but "" ""You have gone beyond that you have sidestepped them admirably. What about the attire of the two men? Are you proposing that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?"" ""I fail to see the relevance,"" I objected somewhat petulantly. ""He might have coerced clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil earlier in the day."" ""Through coercion, you say? You genuinely put forward that theory?"" ""Certainly. He could have threatened to expose her identity to the Renaulds, potentially ruining any chance of her daughter's marriage."" ""You are mistaken, Hastings.",1
"Blair was obsessed with capturing unique photographs as we journeyed higher and higher up the mountain. She insisted on snapping shots of the train's front from the back, claiming it would look dangerously thrilling against the mountain backdrop. Anne Beddingfeld expressed relief at traveling during daylight, marveling at the magnificent scenery. Colonel Race informed her that they only had three trains a week to Rhodesia, leading to a discussion about their plans at the Falls and Johannesburg. Race's assurance about the safety of Jo'burg prompted a skeptical response from Sir Eustace, who suspected Race had ulterior motives involving Anne. The dynamic between the characters hinted at underlying tensions and unspoken desires.",1
"""Did Renauld prevent Madame Daubreuil from leaving? Had she departed already?"" ""Yes, sir. I overheard them exiting the study and heading towards the door. Monsieur bid her good night and closed the door behind her."" ""At what time did this occur?"" ""Around twenty-five minutes past ten, sir."" ""Do you know when M. Renauld retired to bed?"" ""I heard him ascending the stairs about ten minutes after us. The stairs creak so loudly that one can hear every step taken."" ""And is that all? Did you hear any commotion during the night?"" ""Absolutely nothing, sir."" ""Who was the first servant to come downstairs in the morning?"" ""That would be me, sir.""",1
"Upon reflection, Havering's encounter with the mysterious figure could be crucial to cracking the case. With her keen eye for detail, she might have observed something pivotal. I promptly penned a detailed letter to Poirot, elaborating on the situation. Additional pieces of evidence were included before I dispatched the correspondence. The bullet recovered matched a revolver in police possession. Moreover, Mr. Havering's alibi was corroborated, confirming his presence in London on the fateful night.",1
"""The small grey matter always remembers the small grey matter, my friend!"" I settled into my chair, responding casually to Poirot's greeting by mentioning that a one-hour sea journey from Calais to Dover could hardly be considered ""terrible."" Poirot vigorously disagreed, waving his egg-spoon to emphasize his point. ""Not at all! If in one hour one endures sensations and emotions of the utmost terror, one has truly lived! Does not one of your English poets suggest that time is measured not by hours, but by heartbeats?"" ""I believe Browning was alluding to something more romantic than seasickness, however."" ""Because he was an Englishman, an islander for whom the English Channel meant nothing.""",1
"I made sure to thoroughly search the girl's belongings upon her arrival. ""Where did you suddenly pull that from? It wasn't there a moment ago,"" I questioned. ""Actually, it was,"" she responded calmly. ""I had it hidden in my stocking."" Sir Eustace lamented his lack of knowledge about women, admitting, ""I should have paid more attention to them."" Harry's patience wore thin as he slammed his hand on the table. ""Stop the nonsense. If it weren't for your age, I'd toss you out the window, you scoundrel! Age or no age,"" he growled, taking a few steps forward while Sir Eustace quickly retreated behind the table.",1
"“We gratefully accepted her offer of something to eat, hoping our presence might distract her from her grief. Just as we finished our soup, a scream and the sound of breaking crockery startled us. The parlourmaid rushed in, her hand clutching her heart. “There was a man in the passage,” she gasped. Poirot quickly investigated, but found no one there. “Are you sure?” the maid whispered weakly. “It truly gave me a fright!” “But why?” Poirot inquired, lowering his voice.",1
"""You're certain of that?"" ""Yes."" ""No small disagreements, right?"" Jack simply shrugged. ""Everyone's entitled to their own opinion."" ""Of course, of course. But if someone were to claim that you had a heated argument with your father before leaving for Paris, that person would be lying, correct?"" I couldn't help but admire Giraud's cleverness. His claim that ""I know everything"" was no joke. Jack Renauld seemed uneasy at the question. ""We did argue,"" he confessed. ""Ah, an argument! And during that argument, did you say: 'When you're dead, I can do what I want'?"" ""I might have,"" Jack muttered.",1
"""I was just starting to relax when Suzanne abruptly asked: “What's the opposite?” “The opposite of what?” I replied. “There has to be an opposite. What's the term for skulls that are more than 75% as wide as they are long?” “Brachycephalic,” I reluctantly admitted. “Ah, that's right. I thought I heard you say that.” “Did I? Must have misspoke. I meant dolichocephalic,” I confidently stated. Suzanne stared at me intently. Then she burst out laughing. “You're a good liar, Gipsy girl. But let's cut to the chase, tell me everything now to save time and trouble.”",1
"""They're not the hands of a gentleman,"" he stated, in response to my gaze. ""In fact, his attire suggests he's a man of means. Quite intriguing, wouldn't you say?"" ""Intriguing indeed,"" I concurred. ""And there's no identifiable markings on any of his clothes. What can we deduce from that? This individual was attempting to present himself as someone else. He was pretending. But why? Was he running from something? Was he trying to evade capture by assuming a different persona? At this point, we can only speculate. However, one thing is certain - he was just as determined to hide his true self as we are to uncover it.""",1
"Pagett always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else. As I leisurely settled into my deck-chair next to Mrs. Blair, I couldn't help but comment on the state of the clergy in modern times. Casually, I extended an invitation to Mrs. Blair to join me for dinner on the evening of the upcoming Fancy Dress dance, a proposition that Race somehow finagled his way into as well. Following lunch, the Beddingfeld girl joined us for coffee, confirming my previous observation about the exceptional quality of her legs. Without a doubt, I will be extending an invitation to her for dinner too.",1
"""I will inform the authorities."" Poirot made his way down the steps. ""No, please don't do that!"" The man ran after him. Poirot swiftly pushed him down the steps. Within moments, all three of us were safely inside, the door bolted shut. ""Quick, in here."" Poirot led us into the nearest room, turning on the light. ""And you, hide behind the curtain."" ""Yes, sir,"" said the Italian, disappearing behind the rose-coloured velvet drapes. Just in time, as a woman rushed in, tall with red hair, clutching a scarlet kimono. ""Where is my husband?"" she demanded, looking around frantically. Poirot stepped forward gracefully. ""I hope your husband won't catch a cold. I noticed he was wearing slippers and a warm dressing-gown."" ""Who are you? What are you doing here?"" ""It's unfortunate that we haven't had the pleasure of meeting, madame. One of us came all the way from New York just to see you."" The Italian emerged from the curtains, holding my revolver. The woman screamed and tried to run, but Poirot blocked the door. ""Let me pass,"" she cried. ""He'll kill me."" ""Who killed Luigi Valdarno?"" asked the Italian, pointing the gun at us. We stood frozen. ""Poirot, this is terrible. What do we do?"" I asked anxiously. ""Please, Hastings, try to stay quiet. I assure you, our friend won't shoot without my signal,"" Poirot replied calmly. ""Are you sure about that?"" sneered the Italian. The woman turned to Poirot. ""What do you want?"" Poirot bowed. ""I don't think I need to explain things to Miss Elsa Hardt."" The woman grabbed a black velvet cat covering the telephone. ""They're hidden in here."" ""Impressive,"" Poirot commented. He stepped aside. ""Goodbye, madame. I'll keep your friend occupied while you make your escape."" ""You fool!"" the Italian shouted, aiming the gun at the woman. I lunged at him, but the gun clicked harmlessly. Poirot shook his head. ""You shouldn't carry loaded pistols, my friend. I wouldn't allow an acquaintance to do so either."" The Italian swore as Poirot continued to address him sternly. ""I saved you from a noose. The police are waiting outside. You can leave now, but be cautious. Ah, he's gone! Hastings, you look at me with reproach. It was all so clear! Out of hundreds of applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions, only the Robinsons were chosen. Why? What made them stand out? Their name, perhaps!"" ""But Robinson is a common name,"" I objected. ""Exactly! That's the point. Elsa Hardt and her companion took the flat under the name Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. When they realized they were being hunted by a secret society, they devised a plan. They knew their pursuers didn't know them personally. So they offered the flat at a low price, waiting for a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson to show up. And when she did, the avenger struck. Vengeance satisfied, and Elsa Hardt escaped once more. We must hurry back. I hear Japp and his team arriving."" The door knocker sounded loudly. ""How did you find this address?"" I asked as we left. ""You had the first Mrs. Robinson followed,"" Poirot explained. ""Well done, Hastings. Now, let's give Japp a surprise.""",1
"Poirot and I hurried to Saint-Omer to meet M. Hautet, the examining magistrate. We were ushered into his room, where he expressed his relief that Poirot had not actually returned to England. M. Hautet lamented the skill of Giraud, the detective, and his certainty of Jack Renauld's guilt. Poirot, however, remained unconvinced, citing various obscure points in the case. When asked about Jack's defense, M. Hautet revealed his frustration with Jack's silence during questioning. The magistrate also shared concerns about Madame Renauld's fragile mental state after the tragic events. As the conversation turned to a letter for Poirot, I couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom.",1
"When he dared to challenge Fate, he proved to be a skilled player. He could face defeat with a grin. ""Regardless,"" he remarked casually, ""I doubt our paths will cross again."" ""No,"" I responded slowly. ""I don't think so."" ""Farewell then."" ""Farewell."" He squeezed my hand tightly, his unusual gleaming eyes locking with mine for a moment, then he abruptly departed, his footsteps resonating along the ship's deck. The sound reverberated in my ears. Footsteps exiting my world. I must confess, the following couple of hours were far from pleasant.",1
"I wonder about this Chichester character who seems so innocent. Perhaps Pagett will have some insight. He always seems to know everything. The evening was quite eventful, with Mrs. Blair's refusal to dress up and Race's sudden chattiness after some champagne. I danced with various ladies, including Anne Beddingfeld, who looked stunning in her gipsy costume. As the night went on, I shared some entertaining lion stories, much to the amusement of the guests. It was a delightful evening, despite Pagett's absence and Reeves' presence. The South African Labour party member might come in handy for some information I seek. Overall, it was a night full of surprises and laughter.",1
"Mr. Poirot and I were waiting in the hotel room of the Opalsens. Mrs. Opalsen was weeping, her pearls missing. Mr. Opalsen paced angrily, while two police officials stood by. The chambermaid and the French maid were also present, both in distress. Mrs. Opalsen believed in luck, convinced that Poirot was the one to find her pearls. Poirot reassured her, promising to help. Mrs. Opalsen then recounted how she found her jewel-case empty after dinner, despite the room being locked and her maid present. The inspector suggested a duplicate key was used. Célestine, the maid, was horrified at the implication and turned to Poirot for help, disregarding the police's incompetence.",1
"""Suzanne, in her matrimonial situation, longed for a man to lean on. Nevertheless, she vowed not to disclose anything to Colonel Race and we proceeded with our strategizing. ‘It is evident that I must remain here and monitor Pagett, and this is the most effective approach. I must make it seem like I am leaving for Durban tonight, pack my belongings and so forth, but in reality, I will check into a small hotel in town. I can modify my appearance slightly, wear a blonde toupee and a thick white lace veil, and I will have a better chance of uncovering his true motives if he believes I am safely out of the picture.’ Suzanne wholeheartedly endorsed this plan. We carried out elaborate and ostentatious arrangements, confirming the train departure time at the office and preparing my luggage. We had dinner together at the restaurant. Colonel Race was absent, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were seated at their table by the window. Pagett left halfway through the meal, which irked me as I had intended to bid him farewell. Nevertheless, Sir Eustace would suffice. After finishing my meal, I approached him. ‘Farewell, Sir Eustace,’ I uttered. ‘I am departing for Durban tonight.’ Sir Eustace let out a heavy sigh. ‘So I heard. Would you like me to accompany you?’ ‘I would appreciate it.’ ‘Lovely girl. Are you absolutely certain you won’t reconsider and come to search for lions in Rhodesia?’ ‘Absolutely sure.’ ‘He must be quite a handsome chap,’ Sir Eustace remarked plaintively. ‘Some young upstart in Durban, I presume, who outshines my mature charms completely. By the way, Pagett will be going down in the car shortly. He could drop you off at the station.’ ‘Oh, no, thank you,’ I hastily declined. ‘Mrs. Blair and I have arranged for our own taxi.’ The last thing I wanted was to travel with Guy Pagett! Sir Eustace scrutinized me intently. ‘I don’t believe you fancy Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the overbearing, meddlesome fools parading around with a martyr-like demeanor, doing everything in their power to irritate and unsettle me!’ ‘What has he done now?’ I asked, somewhat intrigued. ‘He’s hired a secretary for me. You’ve never seen such a woman! At least forty years old, wears pince-nez and sensible shoes, and exudes an air of brisk efficiency that may be the end of me. A true stern-faced woman.’ ‘Will she be overly familiar with you?’ ‘I fervently hope not!’ exclaimed Sir Eustace. ‘That would be the final straw. Well, goodbye, enchanting eyes. If I happen to bag a lion, I won’t give you the pelt after the treacherous manner in which you’ve abandoned me.’ He warmly squeezed my hand and we parted ways. Suzanne awaited me in the lobby. She was to see me off. ‘Let’s depart immediately,’ I urged, signaling to the man to summon a taxi. Suddenly, a voice behind me caused me to start: ‘Pardon me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m about to head down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.’ ‘Oh, thank you,’ I hurriedly replied. ‘But there’s no need to inconvenience you. I’ ‘No inconvenience at all, I assure you. Load the luggage, porter.’ I was powerless. I could have continued to object, but a subtle warning nudge from Suzanne encouraged me to be cautious. ‘Thank you, Mr. Pagett,’ I coldly acknowledged. We all entered the car. As we sped down the road towards town, I searched my mind for something to say. Eventually, Pagett broke the silence himself. ‘I have procured a highly competent secretary for Sir Eustace,’ he remarked. ‘Miss Pettigrew.’ ‘He wasn’t exactly singing her praises earlier,’ I commented. Pagett shot me a cold glance. ‘She is a skilled shorthand typist,’ he replied sternly. We pulled up in front of the station. Surely here he would bid us farewell. I turned with my hand outstretched but no. ‘I will accompany you to see you off. It’s precisely eight o’clock, your train departs in fifteen minutes.’ He efficiently directed the porters. I stood helplessly, refraining from glancing at Suzanne. The man was suspicious. He was intent on ensuring that I indeed boarded the train. And what could I do? Nothing. I envisioned myself, in fifteen minutes’ time, departing from the station with Pagett stationed on the platform bidding me adieu. He had skillfully turned the tables on me. Furthermore, his demeanor towards me had shifted. It was marked by an uneasy affability that did not suit him and repulsed me. The man was a deceitful hypocrite. First, he attempted to murder me, and now he was paying me compliments! Did he honestly think I hadn’t recognized him that night on the boat? No, it was a facade, a facade to which he compelled me to consent, all the while being sly about it. Helpless as a lamb, I obeyed his expert directions. My luggage was stowed in my sleeping compartment, which I had entirely to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. The train would depart in three minutes. However, Pagett had not accounted for Suzanne. ‘The journey will be dreadfully warm, Anne,’ she suddenly remarked. ‘Especially when passing through the Karoo tomorrow. Do you have any eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you?’ My cue was clear. ‘Oh, dear,’ I exclaimed. ‘I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing table at the hotel.’ Suzanne’s commanding nature served her well. She imperiously turned to Pagett. ‘Mr. Pagett. Quick. You have just enough time. There’s a chemist nearly opposite the station. Anne must procure some eau-de-Cologne.’ He hesitated, but Suzanne’s authoritative tone left him with little choice. She was a born leader. He departed. Suzanne followed him with her gaze until he vanished. ‘Hurry, Anne, exit on the other side in case he has not truly departed but is observing us from the end of the platform. Forget your luggage. You can address that tomorrow via telegram.""",1
"“Anne,” Suzanne whispered urgently, glancing around anxiously for eavesdroppers. “A distinctly good idea,” Anne approved, nodding. Suzanne explained how the big cases were sent to Cape Town and the small ones were likely with Sir Eustace. Anne decided to wait until further action was necessary. The next day, she planned to meet Guy Pagett to find out more. Anne received instructions to go to Johannesburg urgently. Anne listened to Pagett’s story about his trip to Marlow, trying to understand his mysterious behavior. Pagett revealed a surprising secret about his past, leaving Anne shocked. Anne pondered her next move carefully.",1
"Not so Poirot. Dressed precisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel. “And my boots,” he wailed. “Regard them, Hastings. My boots, of the neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the sand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which outrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to become limp but limp!” “Look at the Sphinx,” I urged. “Even I can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales.” Poirot looked at it discontentedly. “It has not the air happy,” he declared. “How could it, half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion. Ah, this cursed sand!” “Come, now, there’s a lot of sand in Belgium,” I reminded him, mindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “les dunes impeccables” as the guide-book had phrased it. “Not in Brussels,” declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids thoughtfully. “It is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid and geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they plant them in rows!” I cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start for the camp. We were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were patiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman. I pass over the spectacle of Poirot on a camel. He started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and invocations to the Virgin Mary and every Saint in the calendar. In the end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey. I must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur. I was stiff for several days. At last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with a grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet us. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I’m sorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans.” Poirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush, stayed its course. “Not another death?” he breathed. “Yes.” “Sir Guy Willard?” I cried. “No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.” “And the cause?” demanded Poirot. “Tetanus.” I blanched. All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil, subtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing I were the next? “Mon Dieu,” said Poirot, in a very low voice, “I do not understand this. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?” “I believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.” “Ah, of course, you are not the doctor.” “My name is Tosswill.” This, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as being a minor official at the British Museum. There was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy. “If you will come with me,” continued Dr. Tosswill, “I will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive.” We were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,” said Tosswill. The youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother. He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain. He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles. After a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames. “Please ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,” said Willard. “We are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters, but it isn’t it can’t be, anything but coincidence.” There was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly. “Your heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?” “Rather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is going on. Make up your mind to that.” Poirot wheeled round on the other. “What have you to say to that, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” drawled the doctor, “I’m not for quitting myself.” Poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his. “Then, évidemment, we must find out just how we stand. When did Mr. Schneider’s death take place?” “Three days ago.” “You are sure it was tetanus?” “Dead sure.” “It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for instance?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a clear case of tetanus.” “Did you not inject anti-serum?” “Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing that could be done was tried.” “Had you the anti-serum with you?” “No. We procured it from Cairo.” “Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?” “No, not one.” “Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to tetanus?” “Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.” “Then we have four deaths all totally dissimilar, one heart failure, one blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.” “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.” “Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together?” “I don’t quite understand you?” “I will put it plainly.",1
"As I entered the dimly lit room, the moonlight cast eerie shadows across the floor. The wooden floorboards creaked beneath my weight as I cautiously made my way further inside. Suddenly, a faint whisper reached my ears, causing me to freeze in place. Time seemed to stand still as I hesitated, contemplating the potential dangers that lay ahead. Despite the risks, my insatiable curiosity drove me forward. Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself and pressed on, determined to uncover the secrets hidden within the walls of the mysterious house.",1
"""You know, I have feelings for someone else,"" I admitted. His response was a simple, ""I understand."" I hesitated before confessing, ""It didn't start out that way when we met on the Kilmorden."" His next words carried a weight I had never felt before, ""I see."" His expression was stern, a stark contrast to his usual demeanor. ""What are you trying to say?"" I asked, my voice wavering. His gaze was intense, commanding. ""I now know what needs to be done,"" he declared. His declaration sent a chill down my spine, his resolve both mysterious and unsettling.",1
"""I have some questions for you tomorrow, and once you answer, we will know how to proceed. We have ways to make stubborn people talk,"" he said sternly. Despite the grim situation, I was relieved to have until the following day. This man seemed to be following orders from someone higher up. Could it be Pagett? He called for two Kafirs, who escorted me upstairs. Despite my efforts to resist, I was quickly gagged and bound. The room they brought me to was an attic, dusty and seemingly unused.",1
"As we embarked on our journey, I couldn't contain my excitement. The fresh air filled me with joy and anticipation for the trip ahead. Despite my cheerful outlook, my companion reminded me of the impending task awaiting us at our destination. I waved off his concerns, confident in his ability to unravel the mysteries that lay ahead. With Hercule Poirot by my side, success was surely within reach. But as I teased him about his renowned skills, he simply gazed at me solemnly, sensing something amiss. It seemed as though he saw through my facade, recognizing a sense of foreboding lurking beneath my optimistic demeanor.",1
"""And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?” “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.” “Who are the other members of the party?” “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Johnson, a renowned archaeologist specializing in ancient civilizations.""",1
"Man is a creature of habit. Habitual in his lawful routines, just as predictable in his unlawful activities. When a man breaks the law, his subsequent transgressions tend to mirror the original offense. Take for instance the notorious English killer who eliminated his spouses one after the other by drowning them in their own tubs. If he had only diversified his tactics, perhaps he could have evaded capture indefinitely. However, he fell victim to the conventional patterns of human behavior, convinced that past methods would guarantee future success. And so, he ultimately suffered the consequences of his unimaginative approach.",1
"""Ah, we have it! 'Yardly, 10th viscount, fought in South African War' none of that matters 'married in 1907 to Hon.

""What?"" ""Yes. I sent a telegram to him."" ""I thought you were done with the case?"" ""I no longer represent Miss Marvell since she won't follow my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction and the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Clearly, I need to be involved in this matter.""",1
"Poirot suspected that the Robinsons were actually Elsa Hardt and her accomplice, using a common name to evade detection. The plan was to lure in their pursuers by offering a flat to a Mrs. Robinson. When the real Mrs. Robinson arrived, they would strike. Poirot, Hastings, and the Italian accomplice managed to capture Elsa Hardt, who revealed the location of the hidden goods. The American Secret Service agent, Mr. Burt, assisted in the arrest. Poirot, recovering from influenza, was ready to resume his detective work. Roger Havering urgently requested Poirot's presence in Derbyshire.",1
"I was in the middle of a conversation with him about the shocking events of that day - the failed assassination attempt on Mr. David MacAdam, the Prime Minister of England. The newspapers had little information, only mentioning that the Prime Minister narrowly avoided the bullet. It was clear that our law enforcement had been negligent for such a serious incident to occur. I couldn't help but think that German spies operating in England would go to great lengths to pull off such a bold move.",1
"""If O’Murphy is truly an honest man, what compelled him to veer off the main road? Conversely, if he was a man of deceit, what motivated him to restart the vehicle after only two shots rang out, quite possibly averting the Prime Minister’s demise? Moreover, if he was indeed honorable, why did he promptly head to a notorious haunt of German intelligence operatives upon departing Charing Cross?” “The situation appears rather dubious,” I remarked. “Let us approach this matter systematically. What evidence do we possess regarding these individuals? Let us begin with O’Murphy.""",1
"""I've made a reappearance,"" I informed him gravely. ""How's everything, Mr. Pagett?"" ""All good, looking forward to getting back to work with Sir Eustace,"" he replied. ""There's something I need to ask you,"" I began cautiously. ""It's crucial, more than you realize. What were you doing in Marlow on January 8th?"" His reaction was immediate. ""Miss Beddingfeld, I..."" ""You were there, right?"" ""I had my reasons for being in the area,"" he admitted. ""Care to share those reasons with me?"" ""Hasn't Sir Eustace already filled you in?"" ""Sir Eustace? Does he know?"" ""I'm pretty sure he does.""",1
"""Tell me, what has caught your interest?"" I asked confidently, although half-expecting him to mock my suspicions. To my astonishment, he nodded in agreement. ""You are correct, Hastings. I have always had a feeling that she was withholding something. Initially, I had my doubts about her, suspecting her involvement, if not direct, then at least indirect."" ""You suspected her?"" I exclaimed. ""Absolutely! She stands to gain significantly from this new will, being the sole beneficiary. Therefore, she was immediately under my scrutiny. You might have noticed that I made a point of inspecting her wrists early on.""",1
"""We were unceremoniously escorted out. 'I am not satisfied,' Poirot murmured, stepping onto the sidewalk. 'Were you hoping for more revelations? Those old codgers are not exactly a thrilling bunch.' 'It's not their lack of excitement that bothers me, my friend. I am not anticipating a Bank manager to embody a 'sharp-eyed financial wizard' as your beloved novels portray. No, I am let down by the simplicity of the case!' 'Simple?' 'Indeed, isn't it almost laughably easy?' 'You already know who took the bonds?' 'I do.' 'Then why must we...?' 'Don't get ahead of yourself, Hastings. We are to remain idle for now.""",1
"Chichester and Mr. Pagett. ""You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that sailors are the nicest to women. My purser came to the rescue magnificently. He confidently approached, clarified that No. 17 was my cabin, and offered them Nos. 13 and 28 or the option to stay put. I expressed my gratitude with a glance and settled into my new quarters. The incident lifted my spirits. The sea was calm, the temperature rising. Seasickness was a thing of the past! I ventured onto the deck and learned the game of deck-quoits. I signed up for various sports events.",1
"“Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that fateful night, and if not Marthe, then who did he see?” “Poirot, you can’t possibly think a young man like him would kill his own father,” I exclaimed. “My friend, your naivety is astonishing! I have witnessed mothers who have slain their own children for money. After that, nothing surprises me.” “And the reason?” “Greed, as always. Jack believed he would inherit half of his father’s wealth upon his demise.” “But what about the vagrant?”",1
"""He might have had,"" I answered thoughtfully, recalling our discussion after returning from the Matoppos. ""He’s a very powerful personality,"" I continued, ""but not at all my idea of the 'Colonel.' And, in any case, the notion is preposterous. He’s with the Secret Service."" ""But how can we be sure of that? It’s so easy to insinuate such things. No one refutes it, and the gossip spreads until it's accepted as absolute truth. It justifies all sorts of questionable actions. Anne, what’s your opinion on Race?"" ""I have mixed feelings,"" I replied.",1
"“Kids these days are always looking for trouble,” he remarked disdainfully. “They don't think before they act, just relying on their strength. Let's be rational here. Right now you may have the advantage, but that won't last. My men are all over this house. You don't stand a chance. Your temporary control is just luck.” “Oh really?” Harry's tone of voice caught Sir Eustace's attention, a hint of dark humor in his words. Sir Eustace peered at him. “Really?” Harry repeated. “Take a seat, Sir Eustace, and hear me out.” Keeping his gun pointed at him, he continued, “Luck is not on your side this time. First off, listen to that!” A muffled thud could be heard from the door below.",1
"""I don't want to point fingers, but the murder did take place in Sir Eustace's home,"" Anne said. Suzanne replied, ""I'll keep an eye on him for you, Anne. If he starts looking any plumper and happier, I'll send you a telegram right away. 'Sir E. expanding. Very suspicious. Immediate action required.'""Anne protested, ""Suzanne, this is not a game!""Suzanne shrugged, ""To me, it is. Blame yourself, Anne. Your sense of adventure has rubbed off on me. It all feels so unreal.""",1
"I noticed that the cupboard appeared empty at first, but my persistence paid off when I discovered a hard paper cylinder hidden in a trough in the corner. Upon grabbing it, I immediately recognized it as a roll of Kodak films. This was a valuable discovery! While I considered the possibility that the films belonged to Sir Eustace Pedler and had been overlooked during the cupboard's previous search, the red paper seemed too new for that to be the case.",1
"""Eight years he's been by my side, a loyal companion indeed,"" my acquaintance grinned. ""But we seem to be talking past each other. I'm talking about the woman."" ""Miss Pettigrew?"" I gasped. ""Yes. Reports have her exiting Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop,"" he disclosed. ""Good Lord!"" I interjected. ""I was heading there myself this very afternoon. You could have easily caught me leaving!"" It seems in Jo'burg, no innocent action goes unquestioned. ""But she's been spotted there multiple times, always under questionable circumstances.""",1
"I arrived at the edge of the cliff, overlooking the vast ocean below, far from any signs of civilization. A young boy with a friendly smile greeted me at the door. ""Are you here to see Mrs. Raffini?"" he asked. Leading me through a narrow hallway, he opened a door for me. As I prepared to enter, a feeling of unease washed over me. Ignoring my instincts, I crossed the threshold and the door closed abruptly behind me. A man stood up from his desk, approaching me with a welcoming smile. ""We are delighted you decided to join us, Miss Thompson,"" he said.",1
"""I'll challenge you to a game of quoits tomorrow,"" he declared. I remained silent. ""Do you think you'll never bounce back? I've seen others in worse shape than you, and within two days they were the life of the party. You'll see."" I wasn't in the mood to flat out call him a liar. I tried to convey it through a look. After a few more minutes of pleasant conversation, he thankfully left. Couples walked by, children played, and young people laughed. A few other pale patients, like myself, reclined in deck chairs. The air was refreshing, cool but not too cold, and the sun shone brightly.",1
"“I see that you work independently as a private detective,” Mr. Vavasour stated. “Indeed, we have involved Scotland Yard in this matter. Inspector McNeil is leading the investigation. A competent officer, I must say.” Poirot nodded politely. “May I ask a few questions on behalf of your nephew? Who ordered the lock from Hubbs's?” Mr. Shaw replied, “I personally ordered it. I did not entrust this task to any clerk. Mr. Ridgeway had one key, while my colleague and I held the other two.” “Have any clerks had access to the keys?” Mr. Shaw looked at Mr. Vavasour for confirmation. “To my knowledge, the keys have remained in the safe since we placed them there on the 23rd,” Mr. Vavasour replied. “My colleague fell ill a fortnight ago, the same day Philip departed. He has only recently recovered.” “Severe bronchitis is no laughing matter for a man of my age,” Mr. Shaw remarked. “But Mr. Vavasour has had to bear the brunt of the workload in my absence, especially with this unforeseen problem arising.” Poirot proceeded with a series of inquiries, attempting to assess the relationship between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour's responses were concise and precise. His nephew, a trusted employee of the Bank, had no known debts or financial troubles. He had been assigned similar tasks in the past. Eventually, we were politely excused. “I am underwhelmed,” Poirot commented as we left the premises. “You were hoping to uncover more? They are such conventional men.” “It is not their conventional nature that disappoints me, my friend. I do not anticipate finding in a Bank manager a ‘sharp-eyed financial expert’ as depicted in your beloved novels. No, I am dissatisfied with the case it is too straightforward!” “Straightforward?” “Yes, isn’t it almost childishly simple?” “You already know who took the bonds?” “I do.” “Then why” “Do not fret, Hastings. We are not taking any action for now.” “But why? What are you waiting for?” “For the Olympia. She is scheduled to return from New York on Tuesday.” “But if you know who took the bonds, why wait? They might escape.” “To a South Sea island where extradition is not possible? No, my friend, life there would not be pleasant for him. As for why I wait well, for Hercule Poirot's keen intellect the case is crystal clear, but for others, like Inspector McNeil, who are not as gifted, it is prudent to conduct some inquiries to establish the facts. One must show consideration for those less endowed.” “Good Heavens, Poirot! You know, I would pay a substantial sum to witness you making a complete fool of yourself just once. You are insufferably conceited!” “Do not distress yourself, Hastings. Alas, I observe that there are moments when you almost despise me! Such are the burdens of greatness!” With a humorous sigh, the little man puffed up his chest, prompting me to chuckle. On Tuesday, we traveled to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot adamantly refused to disclose his suspicions or conclusions. He seemed surprised that I was not as well-informed about the situation. I chose not to argue, masking my curiosity with feigned indifference. Upon arrival at the quay where the large transatlantic liner was docked, Poirot became energetic and attentive. Our activities involved interviewing four stewards consecutively and inquiring about a friend of Poirot's who had sailed to New York on the 23rd. “An elderly gentleman, with glasses. A significant invalid, barely leaving his cabin.” The description seemed to match a certain Mr. Ventnor, who had occupied cabin C 24 next to Philip Ridgeway's. Although I couldn't comprehend how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnor's existence and appearance, I was thoroughly intrigued. “Tell me,” I eagerly asked, “was this gentleman one of the first to disembark upon arriving in New York?” The steward shook his head. “No, sir, he was among the last to leave the ship.” Disheartened, I noticed Poirot grinning at me. After thanking the steward and a discreet exchange of money, we departed. “It's all very well,” I remarked heatedly, “but that last response must have challenged your brilliant theory, despite your grin!” “As usual, you fail to see, Hastings. That final answer, on the contrary, supports my theory.” I raised my hands in defeat. “I give up.” En route back to London on the train, Poirot wrote intently for a few minutes, sealing the outcome in an envelope. “This is for Inspector McNeil. We will drop it off at Scotland Yard on our way, then head to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I have invited Miss Esmée Farquhar to dine with us.” “What about Ridgeway?” “What about him?” Poirot inquired with a twinkle in his eye. “Surely you don't think you can't” “Your incoherence is becoming a habit, Hastings. In fact, I did consider. If Ridgeway had been the thief, which was entirely plausible, the case would have been delightful; a piece of meticulous work.” “But not so delightful for Miss Farquhar.” “You may be right. Therefore, all is well. Now, Hastings, let us assess the case. I can see that you are eager to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and disappears, as Miss Farquhar described, into thin air. Let's discard the thin air hypothesis, which is not feasible given the current state of science, and contemplate what might have happened to it. Everyone insists that smuggling it ashore is implausible” “Yes, but we know” “You may know, Hastings. I do not. I maintain that, since it seemed implausible, it was indeed implausible. Two possibilities remain: it was concealed on board a rather challenging notion or it was thrown overboard.” “With a cork on it, you mean?” “Without a cork.” I stared. “But if the bonds were tossed overboard, they couldn't have been sold in New York.”",1
"""But there's a good chance he'll have an extra one for himself."" ""But no one has brought that up,"" I countered. Poirot's voice took on a hint of authority. ""My dear friend, when solving a case, one mustn't rely solely on what is 'brought up.' Many crucial details may not be mentioned at all. And there are valid reasons for keeping them quiet. It's up to you to decide which is at play."" I fell silent, feeling a sense of awe creeping over me. In just a few moments, we arrived at the renowned shed.",1
"The man identified as L. B. Carton from Kimberley, South Africa had arrived at the hotel the day before and booked a room. He seemed to have come straight off the steamer. I was the only witness to the incident. The coroner questioned me, asking if I thought it was an accident. I was certain it was. The man appeared to have been startled by something, causing him to step back unintentionally. When asked what could have alarmed him, I couldn't say for sure. But he did seem terrified, almost panicked. One juryman casually suggested that the man may have been scared of cats, possibly having seen one.",1
"""It's quite the revelation, isn't it, his intention to step down? To step down! Just like a surgeon, or a tailor, or a mechanic,"" Nadina remarked. ""It's to be expected. The 'Colonel' has long been a skilled businessman. He's structured crime much like one would structure a textile mill. Without getting his hands dirty, he has orchestrated and overseen a string of remarkable achievements, covering all aspects of what one might refer to as his 'trade.'""",1
"""It's probably quite pleasant for Clarence to have you as his spouse."" ""I'm quite a handful to live with! But he can always retreat to the Foreign Office, where he adjusts his monocle, settles into a large armchair, and dozes off. Perhaps we should telegram him and inquire about Race. I do enjoy sending telegrams. They tend to vex Clarence. He always insists a letter would suffice. I doubt he would divulge much, though. He is incredibly discreet. It's precisely this quality that makes cohabitation with him unbearable for extended periods. Nonetheless, let's continue with our matchmaking.""",1
"“Not a word was shared with me. We never had that kind of relationship. But he was clearly agitated and quite shaken!” “Interesting,” remarked Detective Jones. “Do you have any idea what might have caused this?” “As I mentioned before, I do not, sir.” “I’m sorry, but we must go through some formalities. What is your name?” “My name is Alexander Moretti.” “When did you start working as Mr. Renauld’s assistant?” “It was roughly two years back, right after his return from South America. I was introduced to him by a friend, and he offered me the job. He was an excellent boss, I must say.” “Did he share much about his life in South America with you?” “Yes, quite a bit actually.”",1
"”She gasped when she noticed the blood-stained tip, her eyes widening in terror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, it is, madame. Your husband met his end at the hands of this very weapon.” Quickly, he concealed it from view. “Are you certain this is the same one that sat on your dressing-table last night?” “Absolutely. It was a gift from my son, who served in the Air Force during the War. He pretended to be older than he was.” Her voice held a hint of pride. “This was crafted from a streamlined aeroplane wire, a memento from my son's time in the War.” “I understand, madame. Which leads us to another issue.",1
"""He was a man who once loved me,"" she said quietly. The Count raised an eyebrow, ""In South Africa?"" She nodded, confirming it as her native country. As her visitor prepared to leave, he warned her about underestimating the 'Colonel', suggesting he may be more dangerous than a mere disillusioned lover. She scoffed at the idea, confident in her knowledge of him. But as he left, his parting words lingered in the air, ""I wonder if you do? I very much wonder if you do.""",1
"""I know where the diamonds are,"" I declared confidently. Sir Eustace's eyes widened in surprise. ""Where?"" he demanded eagerly. ""In a safe place, far away from here,"" I replied mysteriously. ""But I can take you to them, if you agree to let Harry and I go free."" Sir Eustace hesitated, then nodded. ""Deal,"" he said. I led the way out of the room, with Sir Eustace following closely behind. As we walked down the corridor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of triumph. I had outsmarted the cunning criminal and saved the day. The diamonds were safe, and Harry and I were free at last. It was a satisfying end to a dangerous game of cat and mouse.",1
"As we approached the excavation site, a man with a grey beard, dressed in white and a helmet, approached us. ""Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We got your message. I apologize for the absence of a welcoming party in Cairo. A sudden turn of events messed up our plans."" Poirot's face lost color. His hand reached for his clothes-brush but halted. ""Another fatality?"" he whispered. ""Indeed."" ""Sir Guy Willard?"" I asked. ""No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider."" ""And the reason?"" Poirot inquired. ""Tetanus."" I felt my blood drain from my face.",1
"The wind howled outside, sending chills down my spine. With a creak, the door to the room swung open, causing her to gasp in fear. ""This door must be cursed!"" exclaimed Poirot, frustration evident in his voice. He rose to shut it firmly, securing it with a key. ""I will lock it like this!"" ""Please don't,"" she whispered, her voice filled with dread. But before she could finish, the unthinkable occurred. The locked door creaked open slowly, as if moved by an unseen force.",1
"""Absolutely no blame can be placed on him, as it was in no way his fault. Nonetheless, he is feeling quite distressed about the situation, and I have reason to believe that his uncle may have inadvertently mentioned that he had them in his possession. This incident is a major setback for his career."" ""And who might his uncle be?"" ""Mr. Vavasour, the co-general manager of the London and Scottish Bank."" ""Miss Farquhar, would you mind telling me the entire story?"" ""Certainly. The Bank was looking to expand their credit operations in America, and to do so, they made the decision to transfer over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds.""",1
"""And why does it all matter?"" scoffed Giraud. ""Because when you see two crimes with identical design and execution, you know the same mastermind is at work. I am on the hunt for that mastermind, Mr. Giraud, and I will uncover it. This is a genuine clue, a psychological clue. You may be an expert on cigarettes and match ends, Mr. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, understand the human psyche!"" The eccentric little man tapped his forehead for emphasis. Giraud remained unmoved. ""In addition,"" Poirot added, ""I will share one crucial detail with you that may have escaped your attention.",1
"""Any thoughts on how the murderer gained entry?"" ""Perhaps my husband went for a walk and forgot to lock the door when he returned."" ""Does that seem plausible?"" ""Yes, my husband was very absent-minded."" She seemed bothered by this aspect of his character. ""One conclusion we can draw is that the location where they took M. Renauld, where 'the secret' was hidden, must have been some distance away,"" the commissary suggested. ""Yes, far enough, but not too far, as he expected to be back by morning,"" the magistrate agreed. ""When does the last train leave Merlinville station?"" Poirot inquired. ""Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it's more likely they had a waiting car,"" the magistrate replied. ""Indeed, that could help us track them down,"" Poirot acknowledged. ""A motor with two foreigners would have likely been noticed. That's a good point,"" the magistrate added. ""Do you know anyone named 'Duveen'?"" he asked Mrs. Renauld. ""No, not at the moment,"" she replied. ""Have you heard your husband mention someone by that name?"" ""Never."" ""Do you know anyone named Bella?"" he pressed. Mrs. Renauld shook her head. ""No, I don't."" ""Did your husband have a visitor last night?"" The mention of a visitor seemed to slightly unsettle her, but she denied any knowledge of it. ""A lady,"" he clarified. ""Indeed?"" The magistrate decided not to pursue this line of questioning further, not wanting to upset Mrs. Renauld unnecessarily. He signaled to the commissary, who returned with a glass jar containing the dagger found in the outhouse. ""Madame, do you recognize this?"" he asked gently. Mrs. Renauld identified it as her own dagger, but recoiled when she saw the blood on it. ""Yes, your husband was killed with this,"" the commissary confirmed, quickly removing it from her sight. ""Are you certain it's the same one from your dressing table?"" ""Yes, it was a gift from my son, made from an aeroplane wire,"" she explained proudly. ""Your son, where is he now?"" the magistrate inquired. Mrs. Renauld revealed that he was on his way to Buenos Ayres, having been summoned there for business by her husband. The mention of Santiago seemed to strike a chord with both the magistrate and the commissary. Poirot, lost in thought by the window, suddenly approached Mrs. Renauld, requesting to examine her wrists. Upon seeing the marks left by cords, his expression shifted. The magistrate, realizing the importance of contacting her son, expressed regret at the necessity of causing her further distress. Mrs. Renauld, strong-willed, insisted on proceeding with the identification of her husband's body. She braced herself, but upon seeing the body, she succumbed to the overwhelming emotions and fainted. Poirot, realizing his error, vowed to start anew, while the others tended to Mrs. Renauld. Giraud, the famous detective, arrived on the scene, eager to investigate the crime. He dismissed the importance of footprints, but Poirot, intrigued, believed otherwise. The group then headed to the crime scene for further examination.""",1
"""As we strolled down the scorching pavement, I felt compelled to address Poirot. ""I must admit, I have a bone to pick with you,"" I began, trying to maintain my composure. Poirot turned to me, a subtle look of curiosity in his eyes. ""And pray tell, how did you discover my visit to the Hôtel du Phare?"" he questioned. My cheeks flushed with irritation as I responded, ""I happened to glance inside as I walked by,"" trying to salvage some semblance of pride.""",1
"""And the Minister quickly departed. Major Norman and I engaged in casual conversation. Among the cluster of men nearby, I spotted a sly-looking individual conversing with a tall, blonde man. It was none other than Inspector Japp, a familiar face to Poirot and known as one of Scotland Yard's finest. Inspector Japp approached us with a friendly greeting. 'I heard you were involved in this case as well. Quite a clever operation so far. The culprits have managed to evade capture thus far, but I have my doubts about their ability to keep him concealed for much longer.'""",1
"Each man had his own theory. Poirot was uncharacteristically silent, his face reflecting a childlike confusion. I chatted with Norman, who I found quite entertaining. Upon reaching Dover, Poirot's behavior filled me with amusement. As we boarded the boat, he grasped my arm tightly. The wind howled loudly. ""Mon Dieu!"" he whispered. ""This is dreadful!"" ""Stay strong, Poirot,"" I reassured him. ""You will prevail. I believe in you."" ""Ah, my friend, you misunderstand my feelings.""",1
"Poirot analyzed the situation carefully. ""They did not leave through the door. They left by the window,"" he declared. His statement left me puzzled, trying to understand the implications of such a revelation. The open door now seemed like a distraction, a red herring to divert attention from the real method of exit. The window provided a much more discreet and efficient way for the perpetrators to leave the scene undetected. This new perspective shed light on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr. Renauld's death and opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for our investigation.",1
"“I was just summarizing the key aspects of the case,” I explained to Poirot. “Ah, so you’re finally becoming systematic,” he remarked, nodding in approval. I hesitated before continuing, “Here are my notes: '1. The evidence strongly suggests that Lowen was the one who broke into the safe. 2. Lowen harbored a grudge against Davenheim. 3. Lowen lied about his whereabouts in his initial statement. 4. Billy Kellett's account directly connects Lowen to the crime.'” I awaited Poirot's response.",1
"With a peaceful night's rest, the boy could be fully recovered by morning, but any excitement might lead to dangerous brain fever. It was decided that someone should stay by his side throughout the night. After doing all we could, we entrusted Marthe and her mother with his care and headed into town. By this time, we were both starving, having missed our usual dinner hour. Luckily, the first restaurant we found satisfied our hunger with a delicious omelette and an equally satisfying entrecôte. ""Now we must find lodgings for the night,"" Poirot remarked after finishing our café noir.",1
"""Pardon me, sir?"" Poirot inquired. ""Do you possess knowledge of your mother's true identity?"" Marthe stared at him briefly before breaking down in tears, her head sinking onto her arms. ""There, there,"" consoled Poirot, giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. ""Compose yourself, my dear, it seems you are aware. Now, a follow-up question, were you acquainted with M. Renauld?"" Marthe lifted her head, looking at him with confusion. ""M. Renauld,"" she repeated, puzzled. ""Ah, I perceive you are unaware of that. Allow me to explain."" Poirot proceeded to dissect the case, similar to how he had briefed me before our journey to England. Marthe listened intently, captivated by his every word.",1
"I am alone and desperate, begging for Jack's salvation. Marthe Daubreuil pleaded with me to help. We rushed to Villa Marguerite immediately, where Marthe awaited us, clinging to Poirot. She was tormented, unable to see Jack in prison. Poirot reassured her, suggesting Jack may be protecting someone. Marthe suspected Jack's mother, accusing her of foul play. Poirot questioned Marthe about her mother's true identity and revealed shocking truths about M. Renauld. Overwhelmed, Marthe begged Poirot to save the man she loved. The next morning, we witnessed Jack's deteriorating state during his examination.",1
"""Over there, on the other side of the water, is where we need to be. We'll have to make a run for it. Can you swim, Anne? It doesn't matter, I'll make sure you get across. It's too rocky for a boat on this side, but perfect for swimming, and perfect for reaching Livingstone."" ""I can manage a bit more than just a short swim. What's the danger, Harry?"" I asked, noticing the seriousness in his expression. ""Sharks?"" ""No, dear Anne. Sharks are creatures of the sea. But you're clever to think of that. It's crocs we need to worry about."" ""Crocodiles?"" ""Exactly. Try not to think about them or pray, whichever you prefer."" And with that, we dove into the water.",1
"We proceeded to our destination, a prime target in the affluent northern suburbs of London. Upon arrival at a grand and imposing house set back from the main road, Norman and I remained by the car while Poirot and a detective approached the entrance and pressed the doorbell. A poised parlourmaid answered the door, only to be met with the detective's authoritative declaration of their intent to search the premises. The maid let out a gasp, prompting a sophisticated, mature woman to emerge from the shadows of the hallway. ""Quick, Edith, close the door. These must be intruders,"" she exclaimed. Without hesitation, Poirot wedged his foot in the doorway and blew a sharp blast on a whistle.",1
"As the morning sun rose, a startling piece of news arrived in the form of a telegram. It was a plea for help, urging immediate action in the wake of a tragic event. Without hesitation, we embarked on a journey to a remote location, guided by the grim reality of a murder that had taken place the night before. The desolate surroundings only added to the mystery and sense of foreboding that hung in the air. Despite the uncertainty and lack of details, one thing was clear - the need for a skilled detective to unravel the truth behind this heinous crime.",1
"""Why was the Mill House chosen as the murder scene? Could Pagett have been made a scapegoat for the stolen diamonds in Kimberley if I had not intervened? Do you think he is innocent?"" ""It seems that way, but we need to uncover his activities in Marlow. If he can explain that, we might be on the right track."" Standing up, he said, ""It's late. Get some rest, Anne. I'll take you to the boat just before dawn. You need to catch the train in Livingstone. A friend will keep you safe until it's time to leave. Head to Bulawayo and catch the train to Beira.""",1
"She can type, I know, for she mentioned it once. To my surprise, Pagett strongly opposed the idea. He has a deep dislike for Anne Beddingfeld, especially since the incident with the black eye. Pagett's behavior is quite mysterious these days. Just to provoke him, I will inquire with the girl. As I mentioned earlier, she has exceptionally attractive legs. (Continuation of Anne's Story) I doubt I will ever forget my initial view of Table Mountain for as long as I live. I woke up incredibly early and stepped out onto the deck.",1
"I clutched the note in my hand, heart pounding. The words were brief but filled with urgency: “We must meet in the clearing by the palm gully. Remember Cabin 17. - Harry Rayburn.” A shiver ran down my spine. Harry was close, I could feel it. Wrapping a scarf around my head, I crept towards the door, cautious of prying eyes. He was a wanted man, and our meeting had to remain a secret. Passing Suzanne's room, I heard her gentle snores. Sir Eustace's door loomed ahead, my next destination.",1
"“I can assure you, I know nothing about him,” I said quickly. “He appeared out of nowhere in London, managed to steal important documents that will undoubtedly cause me trouble, and vanished mysteriously in Cape Town. While he was at the Falls, I was at the hotel and he was on an island. I never crossed paths with him during that time.” I took a moment to collect myself. “I believe you are mistaken. I was referring to your second secretary.” “What? Pagett?” I exclaimed, shocked.",1
"When Havering walked into the hall, his wife hurried towards him with an apology. Left alone, my investigation proved to be underwhelming. Unlike the abundance of clues in detective novels, I found nothing out of the ordinary except for a significant bloodstain on the carpet where the deceased seemed to have collapsed. Despite my meticulous examination and a few snapshots taken with my trusty camera, the scene offered little insight. The trampled ground outside the window seemed futile to explore further, as it had clearly been disturbed beyond recognition.",1
"""I don't know,"" I murmured. ""I have this uneasy feeling that something terrible is on the horizon."" Suzanne shook her head firmly. ""Ridiculous,"" she scoffed. ""Let's shift our focus. Anne, those jewels..."" ""What of them?"" I inquired. ""I fear they may not be secure in my possession any longer. Previously, it was inconspicuous, but now that our close relationship is common knowledge, I may come under scrutiny."" ""But no one suspects they're concealed within a roll of film,"" I countered. ""It's a brilliant hiding spot, and I doubt we could find a better one.""",1
""" Célestine let out a sharp scream, grabbing onto Poirot's arm. He leaned in and whispered something in her ear. She gazed up at him with uncertainty. “Yes, yes, my child, I assure you it is wiser not to fight back.” Then he faced the inspector. “May I, sir? A small test for my personal curiosity.” “Depends on the nature of it,” the police officer responded vaguely. Poirot turned back to Célestine. “You mentioned going into your room to get a spool of thread. Where exactly was it?” “On the dresser, sir.” “And the scissors?” “There as well.""",1
"Poirot shot me a scathing look. ""My dear Hastings, what a brilliant mind you possess!"" he sneered. ""Don't you understand that I have expressly forbidden such a loaf - a loaf so haphazard and misshapen that no self-respecting baker would dare to bake it!"" Trying to change the subject, I asked casually, ""Anything noteworthy in the mail today?"" Poirot shook his head in disappointment. ""I have yet to peruse my correspondence, but these days nothing of significance ever seems to arrive. The masterminds, the methodical criminals, they are simply nonexistent. The recent cases I have taken on have been utterly mundane.""",1
"I declared vehemently, ""I'd choose death over being tough."" As we drove away, I calmed myself down gradually. Unexpectedly, he reached for my hand. ""Anne,"" he murmured softly, ""I desire you. Will you marry me?"" Surprised, I replied hesitantly, ""Oh, no. I can't."" ""Why not?"" ""I don't have feelings for you in that way. I've never seen you like that."" ""I understand. Is that the only reason?"" I had to be truthful. I owed him that. ""No,"" I confessed, ""it's not. I care for someone else."" ""I see,"" he repeated. ""And was that true from the start when I first saw you on the Kilmorden?"" ""No,"" I confessed. ""It's been since then."" ""I see,"" he said for the third time, but this time his voice held a determined tone that made me uneasy. His face was more serious than ever. ""What do you mean?"" I faltered. He gazed at me, mysterious and commanding. ""Just that I now know what I must do."" His words sent a chill down my spine. There was a resolve in them that scared me. We remained silent until we reached the hotel. I went straight to Suzanne. She was lounging on her bed, looking unaffected by any headache. ""Here lies the perfect chaperone,"" she remarked. ""Also known as the tactful gooseberry. What's wrong, Anne dear?"" I burst into tears. I confided in her about the cats, but I felt it wasn't right to mention Colonel Race. However, Suzanne was perceptive. She sensed that there was more to the story. ""Are you catching a chill, Anne? Sounds ridiculous to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep shivering."" ""It's nothing,"" I replied. ""Just nerves or a feeling that something terrible is about to happen."" ""Don't be ridiculous,"" Suzanne retorted firmly. ""Let's talk about something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds..."" ""What about them?"" ""I don't feel they're safe with me. It was fine before, no one would suspect they would be among my belongings. But now that everyone knows we're friends, I'll be under scrutiny too."" ""No one knows they're hidden in a roll of films,"" I argued. ""It's a great hiding spot and I don't think we can find a better one."" She reluctantly agreed, but mentioned revisiting the topic when we reached the Falls. Our train departed at nine o'clock. Sir Eustace's mood was still sour, and Miss Pettigrew seemed subdued. Colonel Race seemed unchanged. It felt like the conversation on the way back had been a dream. I slept deeply that night on my hard bunk, wrestling with vague, threatening dreams. I woke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. The scenery was beautiful, and I felt like I belonged there. Home! Yet I had never been there before, or had I in my dreams? Colonel Race called me from the ""office"" just before half-past two and pointed to a misty white cloud shaped like a bouquet hanging over the bush. ""The spray from the Falls,"" he explained. ""We're almost there."" Still enveloped in the strange sense of elation that followed my troubled night, I strongly felt that I had found my home. We walked to the hotel from the train, a large white building protected against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. Stepping onto the stoep, I gasped. Half a mile away, the Falls stood before us. I had never seen anything as magnificent and beautiful and never would.",1
"""Currently, I am swamped with work,"" Pagett announced. ""Oh, before you go,"" I called out, ""what did Mrs. Blair have in those suitcases?"" ""Just some fur rugs and a few fur hats, I believe."" ""Yes, that sounds right,"" I agreed. ""She picked them up on the train. They are rather unique hats, so I understand why you couldn't place them. Any other items of interest?"" ""A few rolls of film and numerous baskets,"" Pagett responded. ""Of course,"" I nodded. ""Mrs. Blair tends to buy things in bulk.""",1
"The idea excites you, I can tell. You always gravitate towards the extravagant and romantic."" The next day found us settled into our temporary residence. The apartment was tastefully decorated. Though it was on the same floor as the Robinsons, it was situated two levels above. The day following our move-in was a Sunday. During the afternoon, Poirot cracked the front door open, then urgently beckoned me over as a loud noise echoed from below. ""Peer down the stairs. Are those individuals your acquaintances? Make sure they don't spot you."" I leaned over the railing. ""Yes, that's them,"" I whispered clumsily.",1
"As I watched the examining magistrate immerse himself in the unfolding mystery, Poirot inquired about M. Giraud's absence. ""Will M. Giraud be joining us?"" he questioned. M. Hautet responded curtly, ""M. Giraud has made it clear that he prefers to handle the case on his own terms."" It was evident that the examining magistrate was not swayed by Giraud's disrespectful behavior. Without further discussion, we proceeded in silence. Poirot walked alongside the examining magistrate, while the commissary and I trailed behind.",1
"Count Foscatini. It appears there has been an incident at his residence,” he said, catching the man off guard. “I was unaware of any such occurrence. Mr. Graves, who works for Count Foscatini, left not long ago and mentioned nothing of the sort,” the man replied. “Is the Count by himself in the apartment?” “No, he is currently dining with two other gentlemen,” the man answered. “What can you tell me about them?” I inquired eagerly as we rode the elevator to the second floor where Flat II was located. “I did not personally see them, sir, but I believe they were foreigners,” he responded. As we arrived at the landing, facing No. II, the doctor pressed the doorbell.",1
"""I kept a low profile, biding my time before seizing an opportunity. Luck finally intervened when I eavesdropped on a chat between two older men in the neighborhood, one of whom turned out to be Sir Eustace Pedler. That moment sparked an idea - I decided to insinuate myself into his circle as his personal assistant. The snippet of their conversation provided a vital clue. Doubt began to creep in regarding Sir Eustace Pedler's true identity as the 'Colonel.' Perhaps his residence was chosen as a meeting point by chance, or for a hidden agenda that eluded me.""",1
"Poirot muttered softly: ""Ah, c’est comme ça!"" Then, displaying his usual knack for accuracy (which he preferred to call psychology), he remarked, ""So you must be familiar with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?"" ""Gregory crossed paths with her during her time out West three years back,"" Miss Marvell revealed. After a brief pause, she blurted out, ""Do either of you follow Society Gossip?"" We both admitted guilt with a hint of embarrassment. ""I inquire because the latest issue features an article on renowned jewels, and it's quite intriguing,"" she trailed off.",1
"For some reason or other I was uneasy around Colonel Race. He was one of the rare few who could make me feel self-conscious. I headed to my cabin, searching for a wide strip of ribbon or a motor-veil to tame my unruly locks. As someone who values neatness, I prefer my belongings to be arranged just so, and I keep them that way. Upon opening my drawer, I immediately noticed that someone had been rummaging through my things. Everything was in disarray. The other drawers and the small hanging cupboard told the same story. It seemed as if someone had conducted a hasty and fruitless search for something. Sitting on the edge of the bunk with a serious expression, I pondered. Who had been rifling through my cabin, and what were they looking for? Could it have been the half-sheet of paper with scribbled numbers and words? I shook my head, unsatisfied. Surely that was all in the past. But what else could it be? I needed to think. The events of the previous night, while thrilling, had shed little light on the situation. Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so unexpectedly? I hadn't seen him on board before, neither on deck nor in the dining area. Was he a crew member or a passenger? Who had stabbed him? And why? And most puzzling of all, why was Cabin No. 17 at the center of it all? It was a conundrum, but there was no denying that some strange happenings were occurring on the Kilmorden Castle. I mentally listed the individuals I needed to keep an eye on. Excluding the mysterious visitor from the night before, whom I was determined to identify before the day was out, I identified the following people as deserving of my attention. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, whose presence on the Kilmorden Castle struck me as more than just a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the secretary with a sinister air, whose strong desire for Cabin 17 had not gone unnoticed. Note: Verify whether he had traveled to Cannes with Sir Eustace. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. My only qualm against him was his stubbornness about Cabin 17, which could simply be a reflection of his own personality. Stubbornness can be a curious trait. However, I deemed it necessary to have a chat with Mr. Chichester. Quickly tying a handkerchief around my unruly hair, I returned to the deck with determination. Luck was on my side. My target was standing by the rail, sipping beef tea. I approached him. ""I trust you've forgiven me regarding Cabin 17,"" I said, mustering my friendliest smile. ""It goes against my beliefs to hold a grudge,"" Mr. Chichester replied coldly. ""But the purser had assured me that cabin."" ""Pursers are always occupied, aren't they?"" I replied vaguely. ""I suppose they're bound to forget every now and then.""",1
"""The possession of Cabin 17 seems to be a matter of contention,"" I remarked casually. Pagett, with a look of concern, proceeded to reveal a mysterious encounter involving Mr. Chichester and Miss Beddingfeld. Despite my attempts to downplay the situation, Pagett persisted in his suspicions, insinuating foul play. His paranoia extended to the presence of Colonel Race, a Secret Service agent on board. As Pagett spun his tales of intrigue and danger, I couldn't help but find amusement in his dramatic nature. It was clear that the journey ahead was bound to be filled with unexpected twists and turns.",1
"""I couldn't help but chuckle at Poirot's perspective on the case, and my dear friend smiled warmly at me, holding no grudge. He inquired, “But M. Renauld, he played golf, didn't he?” “Yes, he was an avid golfer. Thanks to him and his generous donations, this project is moving forward. He even had a hand in its design.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. Then he noted, “They didn't choose a good spot to bury the body, did they? Once the ground was dug up, everything would have been revealed.” “Exactly,” Giraud exclaimed triumphantly. “That proves they were unfamiliar with the area. It's a strong piece of indirect evidence.” “Yes,” Poirot said hesitantly. “No one familiar with the place would bury a body there unless they wanted it to be discovered. And that's clearly ridiculous, isn't it?” Giraud didn't bother to respond. “Yes,” Poirot added, sounding somewhat dissatisfied. “Yes, undoubtedly absurd!” As we headed back to the house, M. Bex excused himself to inform the examining magistrate of Giraud's arrival. Giraud seemed pleased when Poirot indicated he had seen everything he needed. The last thing we saw as we left was Giraud meticulously searching on all fours, a sight that impressed me. Poirot seemed to grasp my thoughts, as he remarked sarcastically when we were alone, “Finally, you've seen the detective you admire, the human bloodhound! Isn't that right, my friend?” “At least he's taking action,” I retorted. “If there's something to find, he'll find it. What about you?” “Well, I've found something too! A piece of lead piping.” “Ridiculous, Poirot. You know perfectly well that's irrelevant. I meant small details, traces that could lead us directly to the culprits.” “My friend, a clue that's two feet long is just as valuable as one that's two millimeters long! It's the romantic notion that important clues must be tiny! As for the lead piping having no connection to the crime, you say that because Giraud told you so. No,” Poirot stopped me before I could ask. “Let's not discuss it further. Let Giraud continue his search, and me with my thoughts. The case appears simple, and yet and yet, my friend, I'm not content! And do you know why? Because of the wristwatch that's two hours ahead. And then there are several odd details that don't seem to fit. For example, if the murderers sought revenge, why didn't they simply stab Renauld while he slept and be done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him. Poirot brushed a speck of dust off his sleeve with a dissatisfied expression. “Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably far away, since they wanted him to dress himself.”",1
"At the stroke of eleven, a telegram arrived from Poirot: ""Instruct Japp to detain housekeeper at once."" I was shocked, but wasted no time in delivering the message to Japp. He muttered a curse, acknowledging Poirot's reputation. ""If he insists, there must be a reason. I barely gave the woman a second thought. I may not arrest her, but she will be closely monitored. Let's head up there now and conduct a thorough search."" Unfortunately, it was already too late. Mrs. Middleton, the unassuming middle-aged housekeeper who had seemed so ordinary, had vanished without a trace. Only her abandoned belongings remained.",1
"After careful consideration, it was decided that I would accompany Suzanne, no matter her location, and focus solely on my own well-being. It was imperative that I refrained from seeking out thrills or trying to outsmart the elusive “Colonel.” My task was to stay by her side and await further instructions from Harry. The precious diamonds were to be securely stored in the Bank at Kimberley under the alias of Parker. ""There's one aspect we must address,"" I pondered, ""we should establish a code of sorts. We must avoid falling for deceitful messages claiming to be from one another."" ""That's simple. Any communication legitimately from me will have the word 'and' crossed out.""",1
"As the night drew to a close, I managed to convince her to let me walk her to the edge of town. We retraced our path, passing by the cemetery once more before veering off onto a different road. When we reached the first row of shops, she paused and extended her hand. ""Thank you for coming with me,"" she said. ""Are you sure you'll be alright now?"" I inquired. ""Yes, I'll be fine. I hope you won't face any repercussions for showing me around,"" she replied. I assured her that it was not a concern. ""Well then, goodbye."" ""Au revoir,"" I interjected. ""If you're sticking around, we'll cross paths once more.""",1
"I approached Pagett on the platform, eager to speak with him. He seemed startled by my presence, his usual nervous demeanor even more pronounced this time. ""Miss Beddingfeld, I thought you had vanished,"" he exclaimed. The train had arrived just ten minutes behind schedule, with everyone hastily disembarking and pacing back and forth. The hotel porter had mentioned that the train's journey to Johannesburg was going smoothly today, despite doubts due to a recent explosion along the line. It was a surprisingly cheerful notion, considering the circumstances.",1
"""We abandoned her at Villa Marguerite, headed straight to Villa Geneviève, and yet she beat us there!"" ""No, we didn't actually leave her behind. She slipped out the back of Villa Marguerite while we were conversing with her mother in the entrance. That's how she managed to outsmart Hercule Poirot!"" ""But the shadow on the blind? We spotted it from the street."" ""Well, by the time we glanced up, Madame Daubreuil had swiftly ascended the stairs and positioned herself."" ""Madame Daubreuil?"" ""Indeed. One is elderly, the other youthful, one brunette, and the other blonde, but their silhouettes on the blind are remarkably similar for this purpose.""",1
"Poirot and his companion arrived at Marsdon Leigh to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who was found dead in his grounds with signs of internal hemorrhage. The doctor, Dr. Bernard, confirmed the cause of death and mentioned Mr. Maltravers' financial troubles. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was questioned about the events leading up to her husband's death. Poirot noticed a slight discrepancy but decided to close the case and return to London. As they were leaving, they encountered a tall young man walking towards them.",1
"""May I inquire about the departure times of the final train from Merlinville station?"" questioned Poirot. ""The schedule shows eleven-fifty going one direction and 12:17 in the other, however the possibility of a waiting motor seems more feasible."" Poirot, appearing slightly disappointed, nodded in agreement. ""Indeed, that could be a valuable lead,"" remarked the magistrate optimistically. ""A motor with two foreigners would surely attract attention. Well noted, M. Bex."" With a brief smile, the magistrate turned serious once more, addressing Mrs. Renauld, ""Now, there is another matter to discuss.""",1
"""Sir Eustace, the situation is rather suspicious in my opinion. Just consider my illness before our journey,"" Pagett remarked. Interrupting sharply, I stated, ""Your illness was simply a bout of indigestion. You are prone to such episodes."" Pagett looked uneasy. ""This was different. I suspect foul play."" ""Please spare me the details of your ailment, Pagett. I have no interest in hearing them,"" I replied. ""Very well, Sir Eustace. But I am convinced that I was intentionally poisoned!"" ""Ah,"" I mused. ""You've been influenced by Rayburn."" Pagett remained silent.",1
"The farm was not prosperous, leading the older brother, Andrew, to move to Australia where he found success through land speculation, eventually becoming wealthy. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no interest in farming and instead worked as a clerk after some self-education. He married up, to my mother, the daughter of a struggling artist. My father passed when I was six, and my mother followed when I was fourteen, leaving my Uncle Andrew as the only family I had left. He had just come back from Australia and purchased Crabtree Manor in our home county.",1
"I know. But there is still much to unravel in this twisted tale of deceit and danger. The truth lies in the shadows, waiting to be brought to light. And I will not rest until justice is served and the secrets are laid bare. The game is afoot, and I am ready to play my part in this deadly dance of deception and betrayal. Let the pieces fall where they may, for the truth will always prevail in the end. And I will be there to witness it all, standing tall in the face of danger and uncertainty. This is my story, and I will see it through to the very end. Let the truth be known, no matter the cost.",1
"I had always felt his animosity towards me. But now, the tables had turned. I was no longer the one in control, watching from the shadows. Fear began to creep in as I realized I was the target now. I had always been the obstacle in their grand plan, and I feared they would eliminate me without a second thought. Despite Harry Rayburn's past help, I knew the odds were stacked against me. Enemies lurked in every corner, closing in with each passing moment.",1
"""I've behaved foolishly in various ways, Monsieur Poirot. I am deeply in debt but I am determined to turn things around. I care for the children and I aim to resolve my issues so we can continue living in our home. Gregory Rolf has presented me with a lucrative opportunity that could help me get back on track. I am hesitant, as I despise the idea of participating in the pretentious activities at the Chase, but I may not have a choice,"" He paused, meeting Poirot's sharp gaze.",1
"""I am certain of it,” declared Poirot calmly. “May I ask a few questions, on behalf of your nephew? Who was responsible for ordering this lock from Hubbs’s?” “I took care of it myself,” Mr. Shaw responded. “I did not want to leave it in the hands of a clerk. As for the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two were kept by my associate and I.” “Have any clerks had the opportunity to access them?” Mr. Shaw glanced at Mr. Vavasour for confirmation. “To my knowledge, they have remained untouched in the safe since we placed them there on the 23rd,” Mr. Vavasour stated. “Unfortunately, my associate fell ill two weeks ago, on the very day that Philip departed from us.""",1
"""Magnificent, exquisite, magnificent,"" he exclaimed. ""Tonight, you have truly outdone yourself."" With a gallant gesture, he planted a kiss on each of her cheeks in a rather casual manner. Madame Nadina gracefully accepted the praise, a routine she had grown accustomed to, and made her way to the dressing room. The room was adorned with bouquets scattered haphazardly, modern garments hanging on hooks, and the air filled with a heady mix of floral scents and luxurious perfumes. Jeanne, the loyal dresser, attended to her mistress, chatting incessantly and showering her with exaggerated compliments. Suddenly, a knock at the door brought an abrupt halt to the conversation.",1
"He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood. “Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?” I followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural. “Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,” he went on. “Minks is a fool. A clever actor but a fool. That was Minks you saw downstairs.” “Oh, really,” I said feebly. “And now,” said Sir Eustace cheerfully, “let’s get down to facts. How long have you known that I was the ‘Colonel’?” “Ever since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace nodded ruefully. “Yes, I told the fool he’d blinking well torn it. He didn’t understand of course. His whole mind was set on whether I’d recognized him. It never occurred to him to wonder what I was doing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was. I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.” He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind. “Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question.",1
"I trailed behind him, silently mimicking the Barotsi woman I had once observed near the Falls. Unlike her, I wasn't balancing a frying-pan on my head. His pace was so brisk, it proved challenging to keep pace. ""Harry,"" I finally spoke up, my voice meek, ""are we trekking all the way to Rhodesia?"" Abruptly, he turned, bursting into laughter as he swept me off my feet. ""I'm crazy, my love, I admit it. But I adore you so much."" ""We're both insane. And, Harry, you never asked, but I'm not sacrificing anything! I wanted this journey!"" That was a couple of years back. We're still residing on the island.",1
"“What’s this?” “The sleeve of my coat that I removed, can you brush it for me? Look, some white powder has stuck to it. Did you see me run my finger along the dressing-table drawer?” “No, I didn’t.” “You must pay attention to my movements, my friend. That’s how I ended up with the powder on my finger, and, in my excitement, I rubbed it on my sleeve in a moment of carelessness, going against all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I inquired, showing little concern for Poirot’s principles.",1
"Mr. Lowen expressed his apologies and bid farewell. ""Everyone is aware that Mr. Davenheim never came back. The police were notified early Sunday morning, but were baffled by the situation. Mr. Davenheim appeared to have disappeared without a trace. He had not visited the post office, nor had he been spotted in the village. Authorities confirmed he had not left by train. His personal vehicle remained in the garage. If he had arranged for a car to meet him in a remote location, it is likely that the driver would have come forward by now, given the substantial reward for any information.""",1
"“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, shaking his head in a dismissive manner. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, standing up, “all this is very intriguing, but I must take my leave.” “One moment, my dear Pedler, one moment, I implore you. Now, tell me, in confidence, do you not plan on traveling to South Africa soon yourself? You have significant investments in Rhodesia, I understand, and the issue of Rhodesia joining the Union is one that greatly concerns you.”",1
"Carton and She had arranged to meet at the location, pretending that their encounter was by chance. They were both there to see the same house and had taken measures to avoid being tracked. Little did Carton know, the person following him was the mysterious 'Man in the Brown Suit.' The shock of this realization caused Carton to panic and make a fatal misstep. Does this all make sense to you, Anne?"" Anne remained silent. ""That's the gist of it. Carton obtained a document from the deceased individual, but in his haste to escape, he accidentally dropped it. He then trailed the woman all the way to Marlow.",1
"""She feigned great interest in our discovery, and we shared all the details with her, even revealing the diamonds. Delilah, a fitting name for her deceptive ways, played her role convincingly! The De Beers heist was uncovered, and suddenly the police swooped in. They confiscated our diamonds. Initially, we found the situation laughable. However, when the diamonds were presented in court, there was no doubt - they were the stolen De Beers gems. Anita Grünberg had vanished, successfully executing the switch. Our claim that these were not the original stones fell on deaf ears, met with ridicule.""",1
"""The revolver found at Ealing was not the murder weapon used on Mr. Pace,"" Poirot stated confidently. ""Roger Havering, with the help of his wife, carefully orchestrated a plan to mislead the police and divert attention away from Derbyshire. Mrs. Havering shot Mr. Pace after dinner, reloaded the revolver, and cunningly placed it back in its original spot. Their plan was meticulously executed, leading to the unfortunate passing of Mr. Pace and the Havering couple in the Air Mail crash to Paris. Despite Japp's efforts, justice was not served in the end, as the murderers got away with Mr. Pace's fortune. The world of crime is full of twists and turns, my friend,"" Poirot mused, as we pondered the dark realities of deception and greed.",1
"“When I woke up the next day, my nerves were shot. I knew I had to investigate. Immediately, I came face to face with you. You remember all of it… When I saw the corpse, resembling Jack so closely and draped in his elegant overcoat, I was certain! And there was that same paper-knife, the one Jack had gifted Bella! It probably bore her fingerprints. The fear I felt in that moment is indescribable. The only thing I was sure of was that I needed to obtain that dagger and make my escape before it was missed. I feigned a fainting spell, and while you were getting water, I snatched the dagger and concealed it on my person. “I had claimed to be staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but in reality, I hurried back to Calais and then to England on the first available boat. When we were in the middle of the Channel, I disposed of that malevolent little dagger in the sea. It was only then that I felt a sense of relief. “Bella was at our residence in London. She was a sight to behold. I confessed my actions to her and reassured her that she was safe for the time being. Her reaction was chilling, as she burst into laughter… laughter… laughter… a sound that sent shivers down my spine! I believed it was best to keep her occupied. She would lose her mind if she dwelled on her deeds. Fortunately, we secured employment immediately. “And then, I spotted you and your companion observing us that night… I was in a state of panic. You must have had suspicions, or else you wouldn’t have traced us. I needed to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. It soon dawned on me that you were pointing fingers at me, not Bella! Or perhaps, you mistook me for Bella since I had taken the dagger. “If only you could have seen what was going through my mind in that moment… maybe you would have forgiven me… I was terrified, confused, and desperate… All I could grasp was that you would attempt to protect me. I wasn’t sure if you’d be willing to do the same for her… I doubted it! It wasn’t the same! And I couldn’t take that risk! Bella is my twin sister, I had to do what was best for her. So, I continued to lie… I felt guilty, and I still do… That’s probably more than enough for you to handle, I assume. I should have put my faith in you… If only I had. “Once the newspapers reported Jack Renauld’s arrest, it was all over. Bella didn’t even wait to see how things played out… “I’m exhausted… I can’t continue writing…” She had started signing as Cinderella, but then crossed it out and wrote “Dulcie Duveen” instead. It was a poorly written, smudged letter, but I have kept it all these years. Poirot was by my side as I read it. The papers slipped from my hands, and I glanced at him. “Did you know all along that it was the other one?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why didn’t you inform me?” “Initially, I couldn’t believe that you could make such an error. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very similar, but not impossible to tell apart.” “But the blonde hair?” “A wig, worn for dramatic effect on the stage. Is it conceivable for twins to have such contrasting hair colors?” “Why didn’t you tell me that evening at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were a bit too forceful in your methods, mon ami,” Poirot remarked dryly. “You didn’t give me a chance.” “And later?” “Ah, later! At first, I was hurt by your lack of trust in me. And then, I wanted to see if your feelings would endure. To see if it was love or just a passing infatuation. I wouldn’t have let you remain in error for too long.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to hold a grudge. I gazed down at the letter. Suddenly, I picked it up from the ground, and slid it over to him. “Read this,” I urged. “I want you to.” He read it silently, then looked up at me. “What’s troubling you, Hastings?” This was a new side of Poirot. His usual mocking demeanor seemed to have vanished. I was able to express my concerns without much difficulty. “She doesn’t explicitly say, well, not whether she has feelings for me or not!” Poirot flipped through the pages. “I believe you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I exclaimed, leaning in eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She conveys it in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But how do I find her? There’s no address on the letter. Only a French stamp.” “Don’t fret! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can locate her for you in a matter of minutes!” “Congratulations, Mr. Jack,” said Poirot, shaking the young man’s hand warmly. Young Renauld had rushed to us the moment he was released, before heading back to Merlinville to reunite with Marthe and his mother. Stonor accompanied him. Jack’s enthusiasm was a stark contrast to the boy’s weary appearance. It was evident that he was on the brink of a breakdown. Despite being saved from the immediate danger that loomed over him, the circumstances of his freedom were too distressing for him to feel complete relief. He gave Poirot a sad smile and said quietly: “I went through all this to protect her, and now it’s all in vain!” “You couldn’t expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” Stonor remarked dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading towards the gallows.” “Well, and you were heading there too!” added Poirot, with a hint of amusement. “You would have been responsible for Maître Grosíer’s death by sheer frustration had you proceeded.” “He meant well, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he drove me crazy. You see, I couldn’t really confide in him. But, damn it all! What’s going to happen to Bella?” “If I were you,” Poirot said frankly, “I wouldn’t worry excessively. The French legal system is lenient towards youth, beauty, and crimes of passion. A skilled lawyer can argue a strong case for extenuating circumstances. It won’t be pleasant for you.” “I’m not bothered about that. You see, Mr. Poirot, in a way I feel responsible for my father’s murder. If it weren’t for me and my involvement with this girl, he would still be alive and well today. And then my careless mistake in taking the wrong coat. I can’t shake off the feeling of guilt for his death.”",1
"I was enjoying an evening with my friend, Gerald Parker. The conversation turned to house-hunting in London, a topic Parker was passionate about. He had moved from one flat to another, always finding new places. Mrs. Robinson shared that she and her husband had finally found a flat in Montagu Mansions for a surprisingly low price. Parker was astonished by the good deal, suspecting there must be a catch. Mrs. Robinson seemed uneasy, mentioning some strange things about the place that made her wonder if it was haunted. Parker dismissed the idea, but Mrs. Robinson was not convinced.",1
"""As the Prime Minister and his secretary, Captain Daniels, traveled back to town after an Audience in Windsor, the car deviated from the main road and was ambushed by masked men. Shots were fired, narrowly missing the Prime Minister, who downplayed the incident as a scratch. The car was later found abandoned outside a suspicious restaurant in Soho, with the chauffeur, O'Murphy, missing. Poirot, asked to investigate, is granted carte blanche to do so with the assistance of a Military officer and a C.I.D. man. The urgency of the situation is evident as uncertainties arise about the loyalty of those involved.""",1
"Silently, the Kilmorden approached closer and closer, like a dream to Anne Beddingfeld. As she marveled at the world around her, she noticed a figure by her side. It was Rayburn, the man she had encountered the night before. His warning about the dangerous business she was involved in sent shivers down her spine. He advised her to be cautious and not to meddle in affairs that could put her in harm's way. Despite her confusion, Rayburn's words struck a chord with her. She couldn't help but wonder why he was going out of his way to protect her.",1
"Poirot, Bex, and Giraud were gathered in the room, discussing the disappearance of a dagger from the glass jar. Hastings then admitted his grave fault of showing a young lady the body, leaving the door unlocked for twenty minutes. The commissary found it deplorable, but Giraud surprisingly called it admirable, suggesting that the assassin or an accomplice had been near the Villa recently. Poirot noted that the assassin wore gloves, ensuring no fingerprints were left on the dagger. The magistrate's clerk began gathering the papers as M. Hautet announced the end of their work in the room.",1
"Nadina, the Russian dancer, took her final bow on stage, accepting praise from the Manager. After the performance, she received a visit from Count Sergius Paulovitch, who congratulated her on her success. As they conversed in English, Nadina revealed a secret to the Count - she possessed diamonds that could be used to blackmail their chief, the 'Colonel.' The Count warned her of the dangers of blackmailing such a man, but Nadina remained confident in her plan. She disclosed that her husband, who was arriving from Africa, was also involved in their scheme to confront the 'Colonel.' Despite the Count's doubts, Nadina was resolute in her decision to take on their powerful adversary.",1
"“I’m instructing you on how to face reality head-on. I’m teaching you to embrace toughness and ruthlessness, qualities that have led to my own success.” “I’d rather be dead than lose my compassion,” I declared fervently. We climbed into the car and set off. I took a moment to compose myself. Then, unexpectedly, he reached for my hand. “Anne,” he murmured softly, “I need you. Will you marry me?” I was caught off guard. “Oh, no,” I faltered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t have romantic feelings for you. I’ve never seen you in that light.” “I understand. Is that the only reason?” I knew I had to be truthful. I owed him that much. “No,” I confessed, “it is not.”",1
"""But what was the true intent? What was the real purpose scheduled for one o’clock in Cabin 17? It couldn't have been the secretary's stabbing. Scheduling it for a specific hour on a specific day in a specific location would serve no purpose. No, it must have been some sort of meeting and he was en route to attend it when he was attacked. But who was the meeting with? Definitely not with you. It could have been with Chichester. Or perhaps with Pagett.” “That doesn't seem likely,” I interjected, “they could meet at any time.” We both fell silent for a couple of minutes, then Suzanne veered off in a different direction.",1
"Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s. “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat at last! In Montagu Mansions.” “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats at a price!” “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!” “But but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?” “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one.",1
"""For example, if the killers sought revenge, why not simply stab Renauld while he slept and be done with it?"" ""They were after the 'secret',"" I pointed out. Poirot flicked a speck of dust off his coat sleeve with a dissatisfied expression. ""But where is this 'secret'? It must be some distance away, as they made him get dressed. Yet his body was discovered murdered nearby, almost within earshot of the house. Furthermore, it seems too convenient for a weapon like the dagger to be casually lying around, easily accessible.""",1
"A second diamond, identical in shape and size, served as the right eye. Legend had it that this gem too would eventually be taken. 'One eye will head West, the other East, until they reunite. Then, they will come back to the deity in glory.' It's interesting to note that there exists currently a gem closely resembling this one, referred to as 'the Star of the West' or 'the Western Star.' This precious stone belongs to the renowned movie star, Mary Marvell. A side-by-side analysis of these two jewels would be fascinating."" She fell silent.",1
"I wonder what secrets Pagett is hiding. He always seems to know more than he lets on. But tonight, it's all about the Fancy Dress dance. Mrs. Blair and Race are both on the guest list. The Beddingfeld girl, with those perfect legs, will be joining us as well. Pagett, however, seems to have other plans. Instead, a man named Reeves will be accompanying us. He may be small, but he holds valuable information that I can't afford to miss. The evening promises to be eventful, filled with dancing and champagne. And as for Colonel Race, well, he seems to have some interesting stories to tell. Let's see if I can top them with a tale of my own.",1
"“Are you positive it was the same one?” “Absolutely sure. That’s what makes it so perplexing.” “Nothing is out of the realm of possibility. Perhaps there were two identical daggers.” I arched my eyebrows. “That seems incredibly unlikely. It would be an extraordinary stroke of luck.” “You are too hasty in your judgment, Hastings. In certain circumstances, having two of the same weapons would not be so far-fetched. This specific dagger was a custom creation ordered by Jack Renauld. When you really consider it, it is quite improbable that he would have commissioned only one.”",1
"“You're telling me he was murdered yesterday morning?” “I connected it to the theft of the dagger,” Giraud clarified. “It's possible he was killed later in the day.” “Later in the day? Nonsense! This guy has been deceased for a minimum of forty-eight hours, maybe even longer.” We exchanged bewildered looks. The doctor's statement was so unexpected that we were momentarily stunned. A man was fatally stabbed with a dagger that had been reported stolen just a day ago, yet Dr. Durand insisted he had been dead for at least forty-eight hours! The situation was unbelievably bizarre.",1

However, the details he focuses on may not align with my own intentions; he might overlook the significance of the very clues I am after. Let us commence."" Poirot systematically and precisely sifted through each compartment, inspecting the items within before carefully replacing them. It was a tedious and uneventful process.

Giraud has arrived with Jack Renauld and two policemen.""",1
"I found a wallet containing a few notes and a couple of unimportant letters, along with a roll of films that I seemed to have misplaced later. There was also a scrap of paper with a meeting scheduled for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my rush to depart without being caught, I accidentally dropped the paper, but thankfully I memorized the details. After quickly removing my disguise in the nearest cloak-room to avoid suspicion, I headed back to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still at lunch, oblivious to my presence.

"""Indeed, I was taken aback. I had assumed that Miss Anne would be actively involved here, gathering material for the Daily Gazette."" ""Kimberley,"" he muttered. The mere mention of it seemed to disturb him. ""There's nothing worth seeing there, the mines are no longer operational."" ""You know how women can be,"" I remarked vaguely. He shook his head and walked away. I seemed to have given him something to ponder. As soon as he left, my Government contact returned. ""I hope you don't mind me coming to you once more, Sir Eustace,"" he said apologetically. ""But there are a couple of things I would like to inquire about."" ""Of course, my friend,"" I responded with a smile.",1

"Rupert had disappeared into the darkness of New York once again, only to meet his end by his own hand. In the note he left behind, there were troubling words that hinted at a deep sense of regret. He described himself as an outcast and a pariah, ultimately concluding that death was his only escape. As I read the letter, a new suspicion crept into my mind. The ancient curse of an Egyptian pharaoh seemed unlikely - perhaps a more recent evil was at play. Could it be that this troubled young man sought to eliminate his uncle, but mistakenly poisoned Sir John Willard instead? The thought lingered in my mind, painting a chilling picture of a man tormented by his own misdeeds.",1
"The cavity was empty save for one thing - a scrap of paper. Poirot's cry of ""Sacré!"" filled the air, his anger palpable. It was evident that someone had beaten us to it. We studied the paper intently, recognizing it as a piece of the puzzle we were trying to solve. Baker's signature was still partially visible, but the contents of the will were nowhere to be found. Poirot, sitting back in frustration, wore a puzzled expression that bordered on comical, if not for the seriousness of the situation. ""I do not comprehend,"" he muttered. ""Who would go to such lengths to destroy this, and for what purpose?"" ""The Bakers, perhaps?"" I suggested.",1
"Money is tight in the City. All this infernal E.P.D. He rambled on, launching into technicalities where I could not follow him. He was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured something in his ear. Eh what? I’ll come at once. Not taken ill, is she? Excuse me, gentlemen. He left us abruptly. Poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny Russian cigarettes. Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the result. The minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return. Curious, I remarked, at length. I wonder when they will come back. Poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said thoughtfully: They will not come back. Why? Because, my friend, something has happened. What sort of thing? How do you know? I asked curiously. Poirot smiled. A few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs. He was much agitated. The lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times, but he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are distrait; and to make a waiter distrait Poirot shook his head with an air of finality. The affair must indeed be of the first magnitude. Ah, it is as I thought! Here come the police. Two men had just entered the hotel one in uniform, the other in plain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered upstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting. Mr. Opalsen’s compliments, and would you step upstairs. Poirot sprang nimbly to his feet. One would have said that he awaited the summons. I followed with no less alacrity. The Opalsens’ apartments were situated on the first floor. After knocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the summons, Come in! A strange scene met our eyes. The room was Mrs. Opalsen’s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an arm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. She presented an extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr. Opalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials stood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An hotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the fire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman, obviously Mrs. Opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands, with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress. Into this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling. Immediately, with an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang from her chair towards him. There now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do. It was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I’ve a feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can. Calm yourself, I pray of you, madame. Poirot patted her hand soothingly. Reassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot will aid you! Mr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector. There will be no objection to my er calling in this gentleman, I suppose? None at all, sir, replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just let us have the facts? Mrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her chair. Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself. Thus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began. I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room as usual Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by as usual? Mr. Opalsen explained. I make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless Célestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room in the morning while Célestine is present, and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise she never enters the room. Well, as I was saying, continued Mrs. Opalsen, I came up. I went to the drawer here, she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table took out my jewel-case and unlocked it. It seemed quite as usual but the pearls were not there! The inspector had been busy with his notebook. When had you last seen them? he asked. They were there when I went down to dinner. You are sure? Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case. Who locked up the jewel-case? I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck. She held it up as she spoke. The inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders. The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the jewel-case? I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it. You didn’t lock the drawer? No, I never do. My maid remains in the room till I come up, so there’s no need. The inspector’s face grew graver. Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then the maid has not left the room? Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French. The suggestion was infamous! That she should be suspected of robbing Madame! The police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible! But Monsieur, who was a Frenchman A Belgian, interjected Poirot, but Célestine paid no attention to the correction. Monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. She had never liked her a bold, red-faced thing a born thief. She had said from the first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on her it would be very surprising! Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, Célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily. If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie! she declared heatedly. I never so much as saw them. Search her! screamed the other. You will find it is as I say. You’re a liar do you hear? said the chambermaid, advancing upon her. Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse. The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all? I did not actually leave her alone, admitted Célestine reluctantly, but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then. You wasn’t gone a minute, retorted the chambermaid angrily. Just popped out and in again. I’d be glad if the police would search me. I’ve nothing to be afraid of. At this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to it. His face brightened when he saw who it was. Ah! he said. That’s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our female searchers, and she’s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldn’t mind going into the room next door. He looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head, the searcher following her closely. The French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking round the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a sketch. A sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor. Where does that door lead? he inquired, nodding his head towards the one by the window. Into the next apartment, I believe, said the inspector. It’s bolted, anyway, on this side. Poirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and tried it again. And on the other side as well, he remarked. Well, that seems to rule out that. He walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn. And again nothing. Not even a balcony outside. Even if there were, said the inspector impatiently, I don’t see how that would help us, if the maid never left the room. Évidemment, said Poirot, not disconcerted. As Mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room He was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher. Nothing, said the latter laconically. I should hope not, indeed, said the chambermaid virtuously. And that French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girl’s character! There, there, my girl; that’s all right, said the inspector, opening the door. Nobody suspects you. You go along and get on with your work. The chambermaid went unwillingly. Going to search her? she demanded, pointing at Célestine. Yes, yes! He shut the door on her and turned the key. Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her. The inspector’s face grew graver. I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss. He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room. Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully. Si, si, mon enfant I assure you it is better not to resist. Then he turned to the inspector. You permit, monsieur? A little experiment purely for my own satisfaction. Depends on what it is, replied the police officer non-committally. Poirot addressed Célestine once more. You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it? On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur. And the scissors? They also. Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say? Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned. Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand. Again, if you please, mademoiselle. At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket. Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur, he bowed to the inspector for your courtesy. The inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness. Célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Then, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to work to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards, completely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked on sceptically. You really think you will find them? Yes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadn’t time to take them out of the room. The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans. No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so. More than unlikely impossible! said Poirot quietly. Eh? The inspector stared. Poirot smiled modestly. I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case. I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say Go! Go! I said. With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning. Well, mon ami? he demanded of me breathlessly. Forty-six seconds, I replied. You see? He looked round. There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it. Then that settles it on the maid, said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door. Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen. This necklace it was, without doubt, insured? Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question. Yes, he said hesitatingly, that is so. But what does that matter? broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same. I comprehend, madame, said Poirot soothingly. I comprehend perfectly. To la femme sentiment is everything is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact. Of course, of course, said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. Still He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers. With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman. Oh, oh, my necklace! She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round. Where was it? demanded Opalsen. Maid’s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene. You permit, madame? said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow. I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time being, said the inspector. We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible. Mr. Opalsen frowned. Is that necessary? I’m afraid so, sir. Just a formality. Oh, let him take it, Ed! cried his wife. I’d feel safer if he did. I shouldn’t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed it of her. There, there, my dear, don’t take on so.",1
"He simply took her away! Upon her arrival in England, she was completely devastated, yet somehow still alive.” Poirot solemnly shook his head. I tried to keep a straight face. Suddenly, he froze and pointed dramatically at the toast rack. “Ah, for example, this is too much!” he exclaimed. “What's wrong?” “This piece of toast. Do you not notice it?” He grabbed the culprit from the rack and displayed it for me to see. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? No. Is it even round? No. Does it have any shape that is remotely pleasing to the eye? What kind of symmetry is this? None.” “It's sliced from a cottage loaf,” I explained calmly.",1
"I saw that I would be intercepted before reaching the platform I sought. Glancing at the clock, it showed one minute until eleven. If my scheme worked, I could pull it off. I had used the main entrance on Adderly Street to access the station. Now, I swiftly exited through a side door. Across from me stood the post office's side entrance, the primary one being on Adderly Street. As predicted, instead of pursuing me inside, my pursuer ran down the street to intercept me at the main entrance, or to signal the policeman to do so.",1
"""After the incident with Sir Eustace, I was left feeling uneasy. His peculiar sense of humor and covert jokes had put me on edge. I knew I had made a mistake by going to Marlow, but it felt natural at the time. Miss Beddingfeld's curiosity only added to my discomfort. When she finally pushed me to reveal my secret, I hesitated. But in three short sentences, I confessed. It was not what she expected. As I walked back to the hotel, a wire arrived, directing me to proceed to Johannesburg. Signed by Harry, not Andy. Sitting down to think, I knew my life was about to change.""",1
"I inspected the paper that he had lost, a plain half-sheet with some figures and words scribbled in pencil. The scent of moth balls lingered as I carefully folded it and placed it in my bag. Walking home slowly, I pondered over the strange feeling I had during the Tube incident. At the inquest, it was confirmed that the deceased was L. B. Carton, who had checked in at the Russell Hotel. The jury speculated wildly about what could have alarmed him, even suggesting a fear of cats. As the coroner questioned me, I maintained that it was an accident caused by a moment of panic. The case took a surprising turn when a woman was found murdered in a lonely house in Marlow, bringing new mysteries to light.",1
"“No doubt, Sir Eustace, we are confident that the mastermind behind it all, the orchestrator of this operation, is currently located in Johannesburg.” His intense gaze made me uneasy, as if he might suspect me of being the culprit. A chill ran down my spine at the possibility, causing me to question my decision to witness this miniature rebellion up close. “There are no trains traveling from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he added. “However, I can arrange for you to be transported by private vehicle.""",1
"“Have you heard of anyone by the name of ‘Duveen’?” Mrs. Renauld paused before responding, “Duveen? No, I can’t say that I have.” Poirot pressed on, “Has your husband ever mentioned anyone by that name?” “Never,” she replied firmly. “Do you know anyone named Bella?” Poirot observed Mrs. Renauld closely for any reaction, but she simply shook her head. Undeterred, he continued, “Did you know that your husband had a visitor last night?” A hint of color rose in her cheeks, but she asked calmly, “Oh, did he? Who was it?” “A lady,” Poirot revealed.",1
"""They fail to recognize that an examining magistrate of my vast experience is sure to possess a certain discernment, a certain flair. Enfin! the courtesy of the old school is much more to my liking. Therefore, my dear friend, direct me in any manner you wish. We have a few tricks up our sleeves, do we not?” And chuckling heartily, delighted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bid us farewell. I regret to report that Poirot’s initial comment to me as we walked down the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to inspire pity!” We were on the verge of exiting the building when we encountered Giraud, looking more stylish than ever, and thoroughly satisfied with himself. “Aha! M. Poirot,” he exclaimed casually. “You have returned from England then?” “As you can see,” replied Poirot. “The conclusion of the case is not far off now, I believe.” “I concur with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His dejected demeanor seemed to please the other man. “Of all the wishy-washy criminals! Not a clue on how to defend himself. It is remarkable!” “So remarkable that it gives one pause, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even paying attention. He twirled his cane amiably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re convinced of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “Excuse me! But I am not in the least convinced. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment then burst into laughter, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “Toqué!” Poirot straightened up. A dangerous glint appeared in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout this case your treatment of me has been intentionally insulting! You need a lesson. I am willing to bet you 500 francs that I discover the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Do we have a deal?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and muttered once more: “Toqué!” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “do we have a deal?” “I have no desire to take your money from you.” “Rest assured you will not!” “Well then, I agree! You talk about my treatment of you being insulting. Well, once or twice, your behavior has irritated me.” “I am delighted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said nothing as we strolled along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had laid out his intentions all too clearly. I doubted more than ever my ability to save Bella from the repercussions of her actions. This unfortunate encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his guard. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and turned to see Gabriel Stonor. We paused and greeted him, and he suggested walking with us back to our hotel. “And what brings you here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must support one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unfairly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Of course not. I know the young man. I acknowledge that there have been a few things in this case that have completely baffled me, but nevertheless, despite his foolish manner of handling it, I will never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a hidden burden from my heart. “I am sure that many others share your view,” I exclaimed. “There is ridiculously little evidence against him. I would say that his acquittal is certain, absolutely certain.” But Stonor hardly reacted as I had hoped. “I’d give a lot to share your optimism,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What is your opinion, monsieur?” “I believe the situation looks very grim for him,” said Poirot quietly. “You think he is guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will struggle to prove his innocence.” “He’s acting so strangely,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I understand that there’s a lot more to this case than meets the eye. Giraud is not aware of that because he is an outsider, but the entire affair has been highly unusual. As for that, the less said the better. If Mrs. Renauld wishes to keep something under wraps, I will follow her lead. It’s her show, and I respect her judgment too much to interfere, but I can’t comprehend Jack’s attitude. Anyone would think he wanted to be considered guilty.” “But it’s preposterous,” I interjected. “For one thing, the dagger ” I paused, unsure of how much Poirot would want me to reveal. I continued, selecting my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld is aware of that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she regains consciousness, she will undoubtedly state all this and more. Well, I must be going.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand stopped his departure. “Can you ensure that I am informed immediately if Madame Renauld wakes up?” “Certainly. That can be arranged.” “Your point about the dagger is valid, Poirot,” I urged as we ascended the stairs. “I could not speak very openly in front of Stonor.” “That was the right decision. We might as well keep the information to ourselves for as long as possible. As for the dagger, your point does little to help Jack Renauld. You recall that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we departed from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was occupied with trying to locate the company Jack Renauld hired to convert his souvenirs. It was not very challenging. Eh bien, Hastings, they made not two paper-knives to his order, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third that he likely kept for himself. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger issue will not assist us in saving him from the guillotine.” “It will not come to that,” I exclaimed, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I said with certainty. Poirot looked at me dryly. “You ask for miracles from me. Say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he took out the envelope from his breast pocket. His expression tightened as he read, then he passed the single flimsy sheet to me.""",1
"I quickly ascended the stairs, my mind heavy with the weight of the tragedy. The room where the body was discovered was eerily silent, the only echo of the past being the muddy footprints left behind by the intruders. The police had already combed through the room, leaving nothing of interest in their wake. As I examined the plain white walls and bare floor, a glimmer of hope emerged when my pencil rolled under a window-seat cupboard. Retrieving it, my hand brushed against a forgotten roll of Kodak films. The fresh red paper hinted at a recent deposit, leading me to wonder who had dropped it - the woman or the man? The familiar scent of moth balls lingered on the films, igniting my suspicions once again.",1
"""I inquired about the circumstances. Both of us were daring and eager for danger. One evening, we exchanged identity tokens for good fortune! Lucas met his end the following day, torn apart in an explosion."" I recoiled in horror. ""But why keep it from me until now? Why not this morning? Surely, you must have known by now that I care for you deeply?"" ""Anne, I didn't want to ruin everything. I wanted to take you away to the island. What use is money? It cannot buy happiness. We could have found joy on the island. I'm telling you, I fear that other life, it almost destroyed me once."" ""Did Sir Eustace recognize your true identity?"" ""Of course, he did.""",1
"""Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed. “M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.” I gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had overlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was the body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I had a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity. The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name, and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye. “I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.” “Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate ” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.” “The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?” The other detective stared. “Of course.” A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying. “That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But you’ll get nothing from it.",1
"""And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.",1
"""It's hard for you to believe, my friend, that a man would orchestrate his own demise? Instead of accepting this truth, you choose to believe a story that is even more far-fetched. Yes, Mr. Renauld did plan his own death, but there's a crucial detail you may have overlooked - he didn't plan to actually die."" I shook my head, feeling confused. ""But no, it's quite simple really,"" Poirot explained kindly. ""For Mr. Renauld's plan, a murderer wasn't needed, as I mentioned before, but a body was. Let's reconsider, this time from a different perspective."" Georges Conneau flees to Canada to avoid capture.""",1
"""Harry smirked. “We’re in a sticky situation, darling. Concerned?” “Not when I’m with you.” “Ah, but going out in a blaze of glory isn’t ideal. We can do better than that. Looks like they’re splitting into two groups this time. Landing in different spots. Now for my little dramatic touch.” Just then, a bright flame erupted from the cabin. Its glow revealed two mysterious figures huddled on the rooftop. “Using my worn-out clothes stuffed with rags as decoys. They won’t catch on right away. Come on, Anne, we must resort to extreme measures.” Holding hands, we sprinted across the island.""",1
"In a series of events that I am about to recount, a unique sequence of events unfolded from the seemingly insignificant incidents that initially caught Poirot's eye to the dark occurrences that concluded a highly unusual case. That evening, I was in the company of my longtime friend, Gerald Parker. Apart from my host and me, there were approximately six other individuals present, and conversation naturally turned, as it always did whenever Parker was around, to the topic of searching for a residence in London. Dwellings, both houses and apartments, were Parker's particular passion.",1
"I observed the paleness of her face beneath the makeup, and detected the fear in her trembling voice. It was then that the pieces fell into place, revealing why Poirot was on her trail and the depths of her apprehension. Moreover, it was in that instant that the truth about my own feelings became clear. ""Yes,"" I responded softly. ""Is he after me?"" she questioned in a hushed tone. After a brief pause from me, she sank to the floor beside the large armchair, overcome with intense, sorrowful sobs. I lowered myself beside her, enfolding her in my embrace and tenderly brushing the hair away from her tear-streaked face. ""Please don't weep, my dear, don't weep. You're safe here. I'll protect you. Please don't cry, my love. Everything is known.""",1
"Poirot's eyes flashed with malice. ""No need to trouble yourself for information. The Dulcibella Sisters have terminated their contract and disappeared from Coventry,"" he stated confidently. ""Are you certain, Poirot?"" I inquired. ""Absolutely, Hastings. I verified it this morning. What else did you anticipate?"" Indeed, there was nothing else to expect. Cinderella had taken advantage of the head start I provided and would waste no time in evading capture. My intentions had been fulfilled.",1
"""I'll get the scoop from my contact in Livingstone about the hotel and your pals' whereabouts,” I assured her. “Beira,” I muttered. “That's your destination, Anne. Let me handle this.” Our conversation had provided a brief break from the intensity of the situation, but tension swiftly returned. Without exchanging glances, we reached a silent agreement. “Fine,” I replied, retreating into the hut. Resting on the animal-hide sofa, sleep eluded me as I listened to Harry Rayburn's restless steps outside throughout the night.",1
"We made it to shore safely, though my wet clothes clung uncomfortably to my body. Despite the rough terrain ahead, we had to press on towards Livingstone. The journey was grueling, with my skirts tearing on thorns and my stockings long gone. Eventually, I had to stop from sheer exhaustion. Harry, ever the gentleman, offered to carry me for a while. And so, I found myself arriving in Livingstone draped over his shoulder like a piece of luggage. How he managed to carry me all that way, I will never understand.",1
"“Indeed,” I replied. “The additional blade discovered in the tramp belonged to Mrs. Renauld. So, there were two identical daggers in total.” “Absolutely, and given that they were duplicates, it only makes sense that Jack Renauld was the rightful owner. However, that doesn't concern me as much. In fact, I have a theory about that. No, the most condemning evidence against him is once again tied to psychological heredity, my friend, heredity! Like father, like son. Jack Renauld, when it comes down to it, is the son of Georges Conneau.” He spoke with a serious and sincere tone, leaving me impressed despite myself. “What is this theory of yours that you mentioned earlier?” I inquired. In response, Poirot checked his peculiar turnip-faced watch, then questioned: “What time does the afternoon vessel from Calais depart?” “Around five, I believe.” “That works perfectly. We'll have just enough time.” “Are you heading to England?” “Yes, my friend.” “For what reason?” “To locate a potential witness.” “Who?” With a somewhat enigmatic smile on his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how do you plan to find her what do you know about her?” “I don't know much about her, but I can make some educated guesses. We can assume her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name rang a faint bell with M. Stonor, although not evidently linked to the Renauld family, it's likely she's involved in the theater. Jack Renauld was a wealthy young man of twenty. The stage was probably where his first romantic interests lied. It also aligns with M. Renauld's attempt to appease her with a check. I am confident I'll track her down especially with the aid of this.” And he revealed the photograph I had observed him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scribbled on the corner, but it wasn't that which captivated me. The resemblance wasn't perfect, yet unmistakable to me. A cold feeling washed over me, as if a terrible catastrophe had occurred. It was the face of Cinderella. I remained frozen for a moment, the photograph still in my grasp. Then, gathering my courage to appear unaffected, I handed it back. Simultaneously, I shot a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? To my relief, he seemed oblivious to my actions. Any peculiarities in my demeanor had certainly gone unnoticed. He promptly stood up. “We mustn't delay any longer. We must leave with haste. All is well the sea it will be calm!” Amidst the commotion of our departure, I had no time to ponder, but once aboard the vessel, beyond Poirot's sight (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I composed myself, and analyzed the situation objectively. What exactly did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance from the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why did he visit the Hôtel du Phare? Was it on my behalf as I had believed? Or had I foolishly assumed so, and was this visit motivated by a deeper and darker intent? Nonetheless, why was he determined to locate this girl? Did he suspect her of witnessing Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect - but that was inconceivable! The girl bore no ill will towards the elder Renauld, no possible motive to desire his demise. What brought her back to the scene of the murder? I meticulously reviewed the facts. Presumably, she disembarked the train at Calais where we parted ways that day. It made sense that I couldn't find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, then boarded a train to Merlinville, she would have arrived at Villa Geneviève just as Françoise mentioned. What did she do after leaving the house shortly after ten? Likely checked into a hotel or returned to Calais. And then? The crime occurred on Tuesday night. By Thursday morning, she was back in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I highly doubted it. What held her there the anticipation of seeing Jack Renauld? I had informed her (when we believed it to be true) that he was at sea en route to Buenos Ayres. Perhaps she knew the Anzora hadn't departed. But to be sure of that, she must have encountered Jack. Was that Poirot's objective? Had Jack Renauld, coming back to meet Marthe Daubreuil, unexpectedly crossed paths with Bella Duveen, the girl he had callously abandoned? It was starting to make sense. If that was indeed the case, it could provide Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet, under those circumstances, his silence seemed perplexing. Why didn’t he speak out boldly? Was he apprehensive that this former entanglement of his would reach Marthe Daubreuil's ears? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The situation seemed harmless, a foolish youthful romance, and I cynically pondered that the son of a millionaire wasn't likely to be spurned by a penniless French girl, who also happened to adore him, without a far graver reason. Overall, the situation perplexed and unsettled me. I strongly disliked being involved with Poirot in tracking down this girl, but I couldn't see a way out of it without divulging everything to him, and for some unknown reason, I hesitated to do so. Poirot reappeared lively and cheerful at Dover, and our journey to London was unremarkable. It was well past nine when we arrived, and I assumed we would head straight to our accommodations and wait until morning. However, Poirot had different plans. “We mustn't waste any time, my friend. The news of the arrest won't be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but we mustn't waste any time.” I didn't quite grasp his logic, but simply inquired how he intended to locate the girl.",1
"""I had no idea that cannibalism was considered a sacred topic,"" I shot back, feeling a twinge of irritation. But as I spoke, a new thought occurred to me. Considering Mr. Chichester's supposed two-year stay in the heart of Africa, why did he not appear more tanned? His complexion was as fair as that of a newborn baby. Something didn't quite add up. Despite his flawless demeanor, there was an air of artificiality about him. Could he be compared to a theatrical clergyman, I wondered, recalling the young curates from my days in Little Hampsly.",1
"I had uncovered a murder at Marlow that was not the work of a lone perpetrator. The revelations from Colonel Race to Suzanne, along with what I had eavesdropped on in Muizenberg, shed light on the organized crime syndicate I was up against. This ""Colonel"" had his followers intricately involved in various illegal activities. Memories of conversations on the ship about the Rand strike and suspicions of a covert organization manipulating events came flooding back.",1
"""He passed away during my second year at Cambridge.” “Did you have a good relationship with him?” I inquired suddenly. “I’m not sure,” he replied. Then he blushed and continued with sudden intensity: “Why did I say that? I did care for my father. We exchanged harsh words the last time I saw him, and we often argued about my reckless behavior and debts, but I did love the old man. I realize how much now that it’s too late,” he added more calmly. “It was at Cambridge where I encountered the other chap” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes, young Eardsley. His father, as you’re aware, was a prominent figure in South Africa. My friend and I immediately clicked. We shared a love for South Africa and a desire for unexplored places of the world. After Eardsley left Cambridge, he had a final falling out with his father. The old man had bailed him out twice, he refused to do it again. There was a bitter confrontation between them. Sir Laurence had reached his limit, he wouldn’t help his son anymore. He needed to stand on his own two feet for a while. As you know, those two young men then embarked on a diamond prospecting journey in South America together. I won’t delve into that now, but we had an incredible time there. Plenty of hardships, but it was a fulfilling life, a struggle for survival off the beaten path, and, by God! that’s where true friendship is tested. A bond was formed between us out there that only death could sever. Well, as Colonel Race mentioned, our hard work paid off. We discovered a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles. I can’t express our joy. It wasn’t just about the monetary value of the find, you see, Eardsley was accustomed to wealth, and he knew he would inherit millions when his father passed away, and Lucas had always lived modestly and was accustomed to it. No, it was the pure joy of uncovering something new.” He paused, then added, almost apologetically: “I hope you don’t mind me recounting it this way, as if I wasn’t part of it at all. That’s how it feels now when I look back at those two young men. I almost forget that Harry Rayburn was one of them.” “Tell it however you wish,” I said, and he continued: “We arrived in Kimberley full of excitement about our discovery. We brought along a magnificent collection of diamonds to show to the experts. And then, at the hotel in Kimberley, we met her” I tensed slightly, and my hand involuntarily clenched the doorpost. “Anita Grünberg, that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and incredibly beautiful. Although she was born in South Africa, her mother was Hungarian, I believe. There was a certain mystery surrounding her, and that only added to her appeal for two young men returning from the wilderness. She must have found it easy. We both fell for her instantly, and we both fell hard.",1
"I caught a glimpse of Table Mountain as the Kilmorden sailed into Table Bay. The morning sunlight bathed the town below, creating a magical sight. It took my breath away, filling me with a longing for something beautiful. The peaceful moment was interrupted by the presence of another figure on deck, absorbed in the view. I immediately recognized him. The events of the previous night seemed exaggerated in the light of day, making me feel a twinge of embarrassment.",1
"I positioned myself on the floor, mimicking the posture of the deceased. Placing a cushion in my place, I painstakingly recreated the movements and actions of the physician from memory. Completing the task, I achieved my objective. Leaning back, I scowled at the walls before me. An article in the evening news mentioned a suspicious death in the subway, raising questions of intent versus happenstance. The course of action became evident to me, and Mr. Flemming concurred upon hearing my account. ""You will undoubtedly be summoned to testify at the inquiry.""",1
"I could tell right away that Jack Renauld was determined to handle his own case on his own terms, much to the frustration of his lawyer. The judge suddenly turned and ordered, ""Bring in the station witnesses."" Shortly after, a man entered who I identified as a porter from Merlinville station. ""Were you working on the night of June 7th?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Did you see the 11:40 train arrive?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Look at the defendant. Do you recognize him as one of the passengers who got off the train?"" ""Yes, Your Honor."" ""Are you absolutely sure?"" ""Yes, sir. I was familiar with Mr. Jack Renauld.""",1
"""He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind. “Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that. I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms heavily paid for to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt. I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped. To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.” “Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here I don’t want to rub it in in any way but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?” “It does not.” Sir Eustace sighed. “A pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose. You love another, as the books say.” “I love another.” “I thought as much first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it’s the young hero who fished you out of the Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two have half the brains that I have. I’m such an easy person to underestimate.” I think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the kind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize it. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had actually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless other deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to bring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as they deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of him and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson’s Long John Silver. He must have been much the same kind of man. “Well, well,” said this extraordinary person, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn’t appeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.” I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had seemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or would they not? “The fact of the matter is,” Sir Eustace was continuing, “I’ve a weakness for you. I really don’t want to proceed to extremes. Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let’s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind I want the truth.” I was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace’s shrewdness. It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning part, but I do. You’re the kind of girl who would start off like that at a moment’s notice, on the slenderest of motives.""",1
"Reworked text excerpt: The task at hand was intricate, demanding precision. The informant, Coghan, stood before us - tall, weathered, with a touch of gray in his mustache. His demeanor suggested sharp intellect. Back at Crabtree Manor, we wasted no time, entering the study and setting our plan into motion. Pressing on the unassuming bricks revealed a hidden compartment, invisible to the eye. Poirot eagerly reached inside, only to be met with disappointment - a mere scrap of burnt paper.",1
"Mrs. Blair surprised me the next morning by stopping by my chair after walking on the deck with Colonel Race. She mentioned the idea of a funeral at sea being exciting, but I had recovered from feeling ill. Colonel Race and Mrs. Blair then suggested I change to a better cabin, as there were plenty available. Mrs. Blair tried to take a photograph of the Grand Peak of Tenerife, but her camera was set on 'bulb' mode the whole time. As she reached for the rail, the roll of films fell overboard. The sound of a bugle announced lunch, which Mrs. Blair eagerly welcomed after only having two cups of beef-tea since breakfast.",1
"""We rushed up the driveway in pursuit of the fleeing silhouette. Catching sight of a dark figure in robes on the side terrace of the mansion, our target changed course and we followed suit, leading us to witness the encounter. Mrs. Maltravers appeared to almost lose her balance, her face visibly paling. “You,” she stammered. “I thought you were sailing to East Africa?” “I received urgent news from my solicitors that held me back,” the young man clarified. “My late uncle in Scotland passed away suddenly and bequeathed me an inheritance.""",1
"I was relieved to receive a telegram informing me that Anne was safe in Kimberley with Suzanne Blair. Anne had always been a resilient woman, much like a terrier with a knack for turning up smiling. The news of her safety brought me comfort, but I couldn't help but wonder why she had chosen to leave the hotel in the middle of the night to get to Kimberley. Did she sprout wings and fly there? It seemed unlikely, but with Anne, anything was possible. Her mysterious ways always left me guessing, a common theme in my life. As a crime novelist, I was accustomed to uncovering secrets and solving mysteries, but with Anne, the answers never came easy. It was a puzzle I may never solve, adding to the intrigue of our complicated relationship.",1
"She leaned forward, her hand opening to reveal a stone of white fire set in platinum. Poirot marveled at its flawlessness. Miss Marvell explained that they were going to Yardly Chase, where a film deal was in the works with Lord Yardly. Lady Yardly arrived, revealing that she too had received mysterious letters about her diamond. Poirot decided to intervene by contacting Lord Yardly. Lord Yardly confessed his financial troubles and his plan to sell the Star of the East. Lady Yardly disagreed with his decision.",1
"She presented me with the promise of Madeira. A glimmer of hope emerged within me. The thought of stepping onto solid ground was enough to lift my spirits. Wrapped in layers of coats and blankets, my legs barely able to support me, I was lifted and placed on a deck chair like a lifeless body. I closed my eyes, filled with resentment towards existence. The purser, a young fair-haired man with an innocent face, approached and took a seat next to me. ""Feeling a bit sorry for yourself, are you?"" he inquired. ""Yes,"" I responded, my dislike for him growing. ""You'll feel like a new person in a day or two. We encountered rough weather in the Bay, but calmer seas lie ahead.""",1
"""I suspect that these footprints may hold the key to the case,"" M. Bex remained silent, offering only a slight shrug in response. ""Shall we continue?"" he inquired politely. ""Of course. I will look into the footprints further,"" Poirot replied cheerfully. Instead of proceeding down the driveway towards the gate, M. Bex veered onto a path that diverged to the right. The path ascended gently, curving around the side of the house, flanked by shrubbery on either side.",1
"“He will likely remain unconscious for a minimum of seven days.” Denise and Françoise rushed to their mistress, and with them in charge, Poirot departed the residence. His head was bowed, brows furrowed in deep thought as he stared at the ground. I held my tongue for a while, but eventually mustered the courage to ask him a question. “Despite all the evidence pointing otherwise, do you think there’s a possibility that Jack Renauld is innocent?” Poirot stayed silent for a moment, then finally spoke with seriousness in his tone: “I cannot say for certain, Hastings. But there is a slim chance.”",1
"""I won't be long,"" I said in a drowsy state as the landlady informed me of a visitor. Lady Yardly, a well-known figure, entered and we discussed the mysterious blackmail letters regarding a diamond. Lady Yardly revealed that her letters came by post and had an Eastern scent, similar to Miss Marvell's. We tried to make sense of the situation but couldn't. Lady Yardly decided to leave, leaving me to inform Poirot. He returned and was intrigued by the case, deciding to involve Lord Yardly. Poirot believed the diamond was in danger of being stolen, but didn't elaborate. Lord Yardly arrived, puzzled by the situation.",1
"""It will torment me forever!"" ""No, no,"" I reassured. ""Of course it's dreadful to think that Bella murdered my father,"" Jack continued, ""but I had mistreated her terribly. After meeting Marthe, and realizing my mistake, I should have written to her honestly. But I was scared of causing a scene, and feared Marthe finding out, thinking there was more to it. I was a coward, hoping it would blow over. I didn't realize I was driving her to despair. If she had actually stabbed me, as she intended, I would have deserved it. The way she has come forward now is brave. I would have faced the consequences, up to the end."" He paused, then changed the subject: ""What baffles me is why my father was wandering around in his underclothes and my overcoat at that hour. Maybe he had eluded the foreigners, and my mother was mistaken about the time they arrived. Or, was it all a setup? Did my mother believe it was me?"" Poirot quickly reassured him. ""No, no, M. Jack. Don't worry about that. I will explain everything to you soon. It's quite peculiar. But can you recount exactly what happened that fateful evening?"" ""There's not much to tell. I came from Cherbourg to see Marthe before leaving for the other side of the world. The train was late, so I took a shortcut across the golf course to Villa Marguerite. As I neared the place, I heard a dreadful cry. It wasn't loud, more like a gasp, but it shook me. I saw the grave, a figure with a dagger in their back. Then I looked up and saw her. She stared at me as if seeing a ghost, frozen with horror. She cried out and ran away."" He paused, visibly emotional. ""And then?"" Poirot gently inquired. ""I don't know. I stood there, then realized I should leave quickly. I wasn't worried about being suspected, but I feared being a witness against her. I walked to St. Beauvais, then got a car back to Cherbourg."" A knock interrupted as a page delivered a telegram to Stonor. Mrs. Renauld had regained consciousness, prompting a hasty departure to Merlinville. Stonor stayed to care for Bella, while Poirot, Jack Renauld, and I headed to the Renauld car. As we approached Villa Marguerite, Jack suggested Poirot inform his mother of his freedom, while he broke the news to Marthe. We proceeded to Villa Geneviève. ""Poirot,"" I remarked, ""do you remember our first arrival here, learning of Mr. Renauld's murder?"" ""Ah, yes! Not so long ago. So much has happened, especially for you, mon ami!"" ""What about finding Bel I mean Dulcie?"" ""Calm down, Hastings. I have it under control."" ""You're taking your time,"" I grumbled. Poirot diverted, ""The start, now the finish,"" he philosophized as we rang the bell. ""From the sentimental perspective, it's unsatisfactory,"" I sighed. ""You're being sentimental, Hastings. From a professional view, this case lacks order. A man killed accidentally in a fit of rage ah, what sense is there in that?"" Amid my laughter at Poirot's quirks, Françoise opened the door. Poirot headed upstairs to see Mrs. Renauld, returning grave. ""Vous voilà, Hastings! There are storms ahead!"" he warned. ""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""I'm surprised, but women are unpredictable."" ""Jack and Marthe Daubreuil are here,"" I noted. Poirot rushed out to meet them, advising Jack not to go to his mother, as she was upset. ""I must go to her,"" Jack insisted. ""Not with Mademoiselle,"" Poirot urged. A voice from the stairs interrupted, ""Thank you, M. Poirot, but I have my own plans."" We stared in shock.",1
"""At a loss for answers, I complied. Transportation options in Elmer's Dale were scarce. The rundown local garage housed a pair of beat-up Ford cars, along with two station wagons. None of these had been used on the day of interest. Mrs. Havering disclosed that she had provided the woman with funds for a trip to Derbyshire and enough for a car or station wagon to transport her to Hunter's Lodge. Typically, one of the Fords was available at the station in case it was needed.""",1
"I climbed the stairs, determined to locate the room where the tragedy had unfolded. The rain from the day the body was found had left muddy footprints all over the uncarpeted floor. I doubted the police would have found any clues the day after, given the fine weather. The room itself was unremarkable, with white walls and a bare floor. Despite my thorough search, I found nothing of interest, until my pencil rolled under a window seat. Opening the cupboard underneath, I discovered a roll of Kodak films that piqued my interest. The films smelled strongly of mothballs, leading me to believe they belonged to the man killed in the Tube. This discovery gave me a new lead to pursue in the case.",1
"”People from all walks of life have been urging me to tell this tale, from the highest echelons (like Lord Nasby) to the lowest (such as our former maid, Emily, who I encountered during my recent trip to England. “Oh, miss, what a marvelous novel you could craft from these events, just like in the paintings!”). I must acknowledge that I am well-suited for the job. I was involved in this case from its inception, I navigated every twist and turn, and I ultimately witnessed its conclusion firsthand.",1
"Her chest rose and fell with each breath, her eyes widening in disbelief. ""You're involved in this?"" I simply nodded, knowing I had hit the mark. The intensity of her emotions was clear as day. A brief silence followed, her gaze fixed on me. Then, with a firm nod, she spoke. ""Well, paint me surprised! Show me everything. I want to witness the darkness."" ""What do you mean?"" I inquired. ""Exactly what I said. Believe me, I have a fascination for crimes. Why else would I risk my feet in these high heels, trudging through this mess?"" Hours had been spent scouring the area, searching for clues.",1
"In the dim light, there was little to distinguish him, a man who could easily blend into the background. He greeted the dancer with a bow that bordered on theatrical. ""Madame, it is truly a pleasure."" Jeanne caught those words before she made her exit, leaving them alone. As the door closed, Nadina's smile shifted subtly. ""Despite our shared background, let us refrain from speaking Russian,"" she suggested. ""Neither of us are fluent in the language, after all,"" her companion concurred.",1
"He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa. The House of Commons is bad enough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight restriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly before leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman with a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle in Alice in Wonderland. He dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy fashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further efforts by ejaculating something that sounded like “Platt Skeet,” uttered fortissimo and in marked contrast to the rest of his delivery. When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa. I have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at last the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins me to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by his master’s side. And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences too! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders. This morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was urbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he alluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that I should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria. “You expect trouble, then?” I asked. His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far. “There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble. There is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives have been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents which throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import them. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean ‘detonators,’ cauliflower, ‘rifles,’ other vegetables stand for various explosives.” “That’s very interesting,” I commended. “More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that the man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the affair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.” He stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me of being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the thought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of inspecting a miniature revolution at first hand. “No trains are running from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he continued. “But I can arrange to send you over by private car. In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me I know what happens in a case of that kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters of law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms. Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there God knows how long. They’ve blown up the railway line already, I hear. It isn’t even as if one could get a drink there. They put the place under martial law two days ago. “My dear fellow,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that I’m studying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study them from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don’t you worry about me. I shall be all right.” “I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already serious.” “A little fasting will improve my figure,” I said, with a sigh. We were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it with amazement: “Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.” I don’t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne. There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young woman she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She has an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don’t see why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the middle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no train, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel’s wings and flown there. And I don’t suppose she will ever explain. Nobody does to me. I always have to guess. It becomes monotonous after a while. The exigencies of journalism are at the bottom of it, I suppose. “How I shot the rapids,” by our Special Correspondent. I refolded the telegram and got rid of my Governmental friend.",1
"""Mr. Davenheim was known to be out sending a letter, leaving him alone in the study!"" ""Perhaps he took advantage of the situation,"" I proposed. ""But how about the tools? It's not common for city dwellers to carry burglary tools just in case! And it would be impossible to break into that safe with just a pocket knife, of course!"" ""What about Suspect Two?"" ""You mentioned that Lowen harbored resentment towards Mr. Davenheim. What you're really saying is that he had outsmarted him once or twice. And presumably, those dealings were done to benefit himself. Typically, you don't hold a grudge against someone you've outsmarted - it's usually the other way around.""",1
"""You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?"" interposed M. Bex. ""No, I didn't. But it doesn't surprise me a bit."" ""Why?"" ""Because the old man was rattled! I don't know what it was all about."" ""Terrible, terrible,"" said M. Hautet. ""Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot's, Captain Hastings."" Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. ""Sent for you, did he?""",1
"“I can’t definitively determine the time of death based on the medical evidence, but it’s clear the victim has been deceased for more than twelve hours. Can you recall when was the last time you saw the murder weapon?” “Around ten o’clock yesterday morning,” I replied. “In that case, the crime likely occurred shortly after that.” “But there were witnesses passing by this shed all day,” I pointed out. Giraud chuckled sarcastically. “You are quite the detective! Who said the murder took place in this shed?” I hesitated, feeling flustered. “I just assumed.” “Oh, what a brilliant deduction! Tell me, do you believe a man stabbed in the heart would fall so neatly with his feet together and arms at his side? No.”",1
"""It's quite certain that it was Rayburn?"" Pagett seemed completely convinced of that. It was the only aspect of the story that he was clear about. ""There's something very strange about all of this,"" he remarked. ""First of all, where is Rayburn?"" It's true that we haven't seen the man since we arrived on shore. He did not accompany us to the hotel. I refuse to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, though. The whole situation is incredibly frustrating. One of my secretaries has disappeared without a trace, and the other looks like a disreputable boxer. I can't have him accompanying me in his current state. I will be the subject of ridicule in Cape Town. I have a meeting later in the day to deliver old Milray's letter, but I will not bring Pagett along. Curse that man and his sneaky ways. Overall, I am quite out of sorts. I had a dreadful breakfast with dreadful people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took an eternity to serve me a poor piece of fish. And this ridiculous routine of waking up at 5 a.m. upon arriving at the port to see a doctor and raise your hands in the air simply exhausts me. Later on. A very serious development has taken place. I went to my meeting with the Prime Minister, carrying Milray's sealed letter. It didn't appear tampered with, but inside was just a blank sheet of paper! Now, I assume, I am in quite a mess. Why I allowed that foolish Milray to entangle me in this affair is beyond me. Pagett is reveling in my discomfort. He seems to take pleasure in my misery. Additionally, he has taken advantage of my distress to burden me with the stationery trunk. If he's not careful, the next funeral he attends will be his own. However, in the end, I had to listen to him. ""Imagine, Sir Eustace, if Rayburn had overheard a snippet of your conversation with Mr. Milray on the street? Remember, you had no written authorization from Mr. Milray. You trusted Rayburn based on his own word."" ""So you believe Rayburn is a criminal, then?"" I inquired slowly. Pagett did indeed. How much his opinion was influenced by his black eye, I cannot say. He presented a fairly convincing case against Rayburn. And Rayburn's appearance didn't help his case. My plan was to do nothing about it. A man who has allowed himself to be made a fool of is not eager to publicize the fact. But Pagett, undeterred by his recent misfortunes, was all for taking decisive action. He rushed off to the police station, sent numerous cables, and brought a slew of English and Dutch officials to enjoy whiskies and sodas at my expense. We received Milray's response that evening. He had no knowledge of my former secretary! There was only one silver lining to this whole situation. ""At least,"" I remarked to Pagett, ""you were not poisoned. You simply had one of your usual stomach problems."" I saw him flinch. It was my lone triumph. Later on. Pagett is in his element. His mind is brimming with bright ideas. He is now convinced that Rayburn is none other than the infamous ""Man in the Brown Suit."" He may very well be correct. But this is all becoming quite unpleasant. The sooner I depart for Rhodesia, the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. ""You understand, my dear fellow,"" I stated, ""you must stay here. You may need to identify Rayburn at any moment. And, besides, I must consider my dignity as a British Member of Parliament. I cannot be seen with a secretary who has evidently been involved in a street brawl."" Pagett winced. His respectability makes his appearance a source of pain and tribulation. ""But what will you do about your correspondence and speech notes, Sir Eustace?"" ""I'll manage,"" I replied nonchalantly. ""Your private car will be attached to the eleven o'clock train tomorrow, Wednesday, morning,"" Pagett added. ""I've made all the necessary arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair bringing a maid with her?"" ""Mrs. Blair?"" I was taken aback. ""She mentioned you offered her a position."" Indeed, I had, now that I recollected. It was on the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even encouraged her to come. But I never expected her to accept! Charming as she is, I'm unsure if I want Mrs. Blair's company all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women demand so much attention. And they can be terribly inconvenient at times. ""Have I invited anyone else?"" I asked anxiously. One tends to make such offers in moments of excitement. ""Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had also invited Colonel Race,"" Pagett informed me. I groaned. ""I must have been very intoxicated if I invited Race. Extremely intoxicated indeed. Take my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye serve as a warning, do not get drunk again."" ""As you know, I do not drink, Sir Eustace."" ""It would be wise to abstain if you have a weakness in that area. Have I extended any other invitations, Pagett?"" ""Not to my knowledge, Sir Eustace."" I breathed a sigh of relief. ""There's Miss Beddingfeld,"" I mused. ""She wants to travel to Rhodesia to excavate bones, I believe. I am considering offering her a temporary position as a secretary. I know she can type, she informed me of that."" Surprisingly, Pagett vehemently opposed the idea. He does not care for Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the incident with the black eye, he becomes emotional whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is a mystery these days. Just to rile him up, I shall ask the young lady. As I mentioned earlier, she has very attractive legs. (Anne’s Narrative Continued) I doubt that I will ever forget my initial view of Table Mountain as long as I live. I woke up incredibly early and ventured out onto deck. I ascended to the boat deck, which I believe is a breach of the rules, but I decided to take a risk in pursuit of solitude. We were just entering Table Bay. There were fluffy white clouds drifting above Table Mountain, and nestled on the slopes below, extending all the way to the sea, was the slumbering town, bathed in the golden light of the morning sun.",1
"Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.” “And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue a psychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “Eh bien, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the salon door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?” The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.” “Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain Hastings.” Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. “Sent for you, did he?” “You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?” interposed M. Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about. He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities. Your name?” “Gabriel Stonor.” “How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?” “About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met him through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering good boss he was too.” “Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?” “Yes, a good bit.” “Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?” “Several times, I believe.” “He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him?” “Never.” “Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there?” “No.” “Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?” “Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there was a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.” “So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.” The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor the case is like this. There must be no reservations. You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might enfin!” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs. Renauld come in? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very wonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations, or otherwise, could affect her?” “Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that you’re wrong.",1
"""Poirot raised an eyebrow. “Man's vanity knows no bounds. M. Renauld likely assumed his widow would remain faithful. Leaving the inheritance with his son was a smart move, given the reputation of wealthy heirs.” “You make a valid point. Now, M. Poirot, I assume you wish to see the crime scene. Unfortunately, the body has been removed, but we have photographs from every angle for your review.” “I appreciate your assistance, monsieur.” The commissary stood up. “Gentlemen, follow me.” He opened the door, gesturing for Poirot to go first. Poirot politely declined and motioned for the commissary to lead. “Monsieur.” “Monsieur.” They exited into the hallway. “Is that the study over there?” Poirot asked, pointing to the door across the room. “Yes, would you like to have a look?” The door swung open, revealing a tastefully furnished room. Poirot observed the details, running his hand over the chairs and inspecting the furniture. “Impeccably clean,” I remarked. He smiled, acknowledging my understanding of his preferences. “Not a speck of dust, my friend! A rare find indeed.” His eagle eyes scanned the room. “Ah!” he exclaimed, straightening a rug. Suddenly, he found a small piece of paper. “The staff here, much like in England, tend to overlook hidden spots!” Bex took the paper, and I examined it closely. “Do you recognize it, Hastings?” he inquired. I shook my head, though the pink paper seemed familiar. The commissary was quick to identify it. “A fragment of a cheque,” he declared. The paper, with the word “Duveen” written on it, appeared to be in M. Renauld's handwriting. “Ah, I must have missed this,” the commissary admitted. Poirot chuckled. “Always check under the mats! My friend Hastings knows my quirks well. After noticing the rug askew, I suspected there might be something hidden beneath it.” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever cleaned this room. Since there's no dust, it was likely done this morning. I assume M. Renauld tore up a cheque for Duveen yesterday or last night, and the fragments were scattered. This morning…” Bex impatiently rang the bell. Françoise confirmed she had disposed of the paper bits in the kitchen stove. Bex, disheartened, checked the cheque book, finding the last counterfoil blank. “Do not worry,” Poirot reassured him. “Madame Renauld may shed light on this mystery.” The commissary brightened. “Let's proceed.” As we prepared to leave, Poirot casually remarked, “This is where M. Renauld entertained his guest last night, correct?” “How did you know?” “I found this on the chair.” He held up a long black hair. M. Bex led us to a shed at the back of the house, revealing the body of M. Renauld covered by a sheet. With a swift motion, he unveiled the corpse. Renauld, a man of around fifty, appeared shocked and terrified in death. “Stabbed in the back,” noted Poirot, turning him over to reveal the fatal wound.""",1
"We followed the directions given to us, leading us to a grand mansion nestled in the hills. The sprawling estate overlooked the city below, a stark contrast to the rundown buildings we had passed through earlier. As we approached the entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows, catching us by surprise. It was a woman, her expression unreadable as she studied us with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. We knew we were in the right place, but the real mystery was just beginning.",1
"""By Jove, Poirot! I swear, I would pay a handsome sum to witness you truly make a fool of yourself just once. Your vanity knows no bounds!"" ""Please, do not distress yourself, Hastings. Honestly, there are moments when I believe you despise me! Ah, the burdens of brilliance!"" With a theatrical sigh, the little man inflated his chest, provoking a chuckle from me. On Tuesday, we embarked on a swift journey to Liverpool aboard a luxurious first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot stubbornly kept his suspicions and certainties shrouded in mystery, much to my frustration.",1
"""I see,"" said Poirot thoughtfully. ""Perhaps we shall never know."" I felt a shiver run down my spine at the cryptic remark. Poirot always seemed to see more than he let on. As we walked down the dimly lit hallway, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something dark and sinister lurking just out of sight. The mystery of Mr. Renauld's murder was far from being solved, and I had a sinking feeling that things were about to get a lot more complicated.",1
"No sooner had Sir Eustace stepped outside than he reached for a speaking-tube resting nearby. ""Schwart, keep an eye on Minks. He is not allowed to leave the premises without my approval,"" he commanded before setting the tube back down. With a furrowed brow, he began tapping the table lightly with his hand. ""Sir Eustace, may I inquire about a few matters?"" I finally spoke up, breaking the silence that had settled between us. ""Of course. You truly possess remarkable composure, Anne. While others may be fretting and panicking, you exhibit a keen curiosity and presence of mind.""",1
"But the suffering of the heart, monsieur, does it not weigh heavily? Day after day, I witnessed Madame's gradual decline in health. She was a mere shadow of the woman who had first graced our presence a month earlier. Monsieur, too, was not immune to change. His demeanor hinted at deep-seated troubles, teetering on the edge of a nerve-wracking crisis. And who could blame him, given the scandalous nature of the affair? No sense of discretion or restraint. Certainly not the English way!” My blood boiled at the injustice, yet the magistrate pressed on with his interrogation, unwavering in his pursuit of the truth. “You claim that M.",1
"""Please, Renauld,"" said M. Hautet, gesturing towards a chair. ""My heart goes out to you. The news must have come as a dreadful shock. But it's a stroke of luck that you were unable to set sail. Hopefully, you can provide us with the answers we seek to unravel this enigma."" Renauld nodded. ""I am here to help, M. le juge. Feel free to ask me anything."" ""Let's start with this - was this journey undertaken at your father's behest?"" ""Indeed, M. le juge. I received a telegram instructing me to travel urgently to Buenos Ayres, then through the Andes to Valparaiso and finally to Santiago.""",1
"“I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle ” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening.",1
"""Poirot, what do you make of this?"" I asked, watching as he scanned the letter with intense concentration. After a moment, he looked up and replied thoughtfully, ""It appears to be a classic case of deception and betrayal. The question is, who is the true mastermind behind it all?"" I nodded, pondering his words. ""Do you think it's someone close to the victim?"" I inquired. Poirot's eyes gleamed with a hint of mischief. ""Ah, but in matters of crime, my dear Hastings, one must always consider all possibilities. Even those that seem most unlikely.""",1
"I have been a professional in this business since my youth, always employing experts to carry out my schemes. Nadina was an exception, knowing too much for me to trust her. After her death, with the diamonds in my possession, I felt safe. However, I now realize that I made mistakes, especially in involving that fool Pagett. He may have a curious face and a traditional soul, but my sense of humor led me to keep him around. My dear Anne, never let your sense of humor cloud your judgment. I have always known it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but his work ethic made it hard to find a reason to let him go. As for you, my dear, the question remains: where are the diamonds now?",1
"No wonder she fainted! Despite her grief and despair, she has resolutely played her part. The anguish must be unbearable. She remains silent, refusing to reveal the true identity of the real murderers. To protect her son, she conceals the fact that Paul Renauld was actually Georges Conneau, the criminal. In a final bitter blow, she publicly admits that Madame Daubreuil was her husband's mistress, risking blackmail to keep her secret safe. She skillfully navigates the questions of the examining magistrate regarding any mysteries in her husband's past life.",1
"Who was this mysterious young man who barged into my cabin unannounced? He was a complete stranger to me, not a crew member nor a fellow passenger. The real question remained: who was responsible for stabbing him, and for what reason? And what significance did Cabin No. 17 hold in this puzzling situation? As I pondered these questions, it became clear that something sinister was unfolding aboard the Kilmorden Castle. My list of suspects grew as I mentally noted those who required closer scrutiny.",1
"""Friday, we're headed to Yardly Chase to visit Lord and Lady Yardly,"" she said, stirring a faint memory in my mind. There was a scandal a few years back involving their trip to the States. Lord Yardly was rumored to have indulged in wild escapades with some ladies, but there was more to it. Whispers connected Lady Yardly to a Hollywood star - Gregory B. Rolf. Miss Marvell leaned in, ""I have a secret to share, Monsieur Poirot,"" she whispered.",1
"""Enthralled by the tale proposed by Madame Daubreuil, she willingly allows herself to be silenced and tied up. Well, Poirot, what's your take on this?"" I reclined, beaming with the satisfaction of a successful reconstruction. Poirot gazed at me pensively. ""You should consider writing for the cinema, my friend,"" he finally commented. ""You think?"" ""It would translate well onto screen, the narrative you've just shared with me, but it lacks realism."" ""I confess I haven't delved into all the specifics, yet..."" ""You've gone beyond that - you've skillfully disregarded them.""",1
"""Ah, but I possess my own unique expertise."" ""Is it related to what you just revealed?"" ""Oh no, Lord Wentworth. I still have a trick up my sleeve."" ""Oh, do you now? You appear to be quite clever. Well, what is it?"" ""As this supposed doctor entered the elevator, he dropped a note. I retrieved it. It had a scent of mothballs, just like the deceased. However, the doctor did not. It was clear to me that he must have taken it from the body. The note had two words and some numbers."" ""Let me see it."" Lord Wentworth reached out lazily. ""I think not,"" I replied with a smile. ""It's my discovery, you see."" ""You're right. You are quite clever. It's wise to hold onto it. Do you have any qualms about not giving it to the authorities?"" ""I did attempt to do so this morning. However, they refused to connect it to the Marlow case. Therefore, I thought it was justified to keep the note. Besides, the inspector rubbed me the wrong way."" ""Narrow-minded man. Well, my dear, here's what I can offer. Continue your investigation. If you uncover anything publishable, send it over and you'll have your opportunity. There's always space for true talent at the Daily Gazette. But you must prove yourself first. Understand?"" I expressed my gratitude and apologized for my tactics. ""No need to apologize. I appreciate boldness from an attractive woman. By the way, you said two minutes but it's been three, accounting for interruptions. That's quite impressive for a woman! Must be due to your scientific background."" I found myself back on the street, breathing heavily as if I had been sprinting. Lord Wentworth proved to be quite taxing as a new acquaintance. Returning home, I felt a sense of triumph. My plan had worked even better than expected. Lord Wentworth had been surprisingly pleasant. Now, all that was left was to ""prove myself,"" as he put it. Alone in my room, I retrieved my precious note and examined it closely. This held the key to the enigma. Firstly, what did the numbers signify? There were five of them, with a period after the first two. ""Seventeen one hundred and twenty-two,"" I whispered. It didn't seem to lead anywhere. Next, I added them together. This was a common tactic in fiction, leading to unexpected conclusions. ""One and seven make eight, one is nine, two are eleven, two are thirteen."" Thirteen! An ominous number! Was this a warning for me to steer clear of the entire affair? Possibly. Nonetheless, apart from a warning, it appeared to be rather useless. I refused to believe that any schemer would use this method of writing thirteen in reality. If they meant thirteen, they would write it as ""13"" straightforwardly. There was a gap between the one and the two. Hence, I subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The answer was a hundred and fifty-nine. I repeated the process and arrived at a hundred and forty-nine. These mathematical exercises were likely beneficial as practice, but in terms of solving the puzzle, they seemed entirely fruitless. I abandoned arithmetic, refraining from fanciful divisions or multiplications, and shifted my focus to the words. Kilmorden Castle. That was a concrete lead.""",1
"But she had firmly rejected any further involvement with her husband's killer, leading him to retaliate by sending a letter accusing her. She adamantly denied any part in plotting the crime, claiming she only discovered Georges Conneau with the bloody knife in hand that fateful night. Madame Beroldy's account was dubious at best, yet her talent for persuasion, honed through tales of royal scandals, made her narrative convincing. Her closing argument to the jury was nothing short of brilliant.",1
"Poirot and Hastings were deep in discussion, trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the murder of Mr. Renauld. As they debated various theories, Poirot suddenly paused and looked at Hastings with a glint in his eye. ""I have it,"" he exclaimed. ""The answer lies not in the open door, but in the closed window."" Hastings was taken aback by this revelation. ""The window?"" he asked, puzzled. ""Yes, the window,"" Poirot replied, his mind racing with possibilities. ""It is clear to me now that the murderer did not leave through the door, but through the window. That is where we will find our answers."" With a newfound determination, Poirot and Hastings set out to investigate the window, knowing that it held the key to solving the case.",1
"""I appreciate your concern,"" I responded, trying to mask my frustration. ""Miss Emery, the governess, is resigning."" Mrs. Thompson, the employer, hesitated before asking, ""Since your search hasn't yielded results, would you consider staying on permanently?"" Surprised by the offer, I realized it was out of kindness rather than genuine desire. Overwhelmed with guilt for judging her unfairly, I rose from my seat and embraced her. ""You're too kind,"" I whispered gratefully. ""But I have plans to leave for South Africa this weekend."" My unexpected show of affection caught Mrs. Thompson off guard, unaccustomed to such displays.",1
"""At what time should we commence?"" ""The stroke of midnight holds an air of solemnity and seems fitting, I believe. It is unlikely that anything will transpire before then."" Promptly at twelve o’clock, we stealthily entered the coal-lift and descended to the second level. With Poirot's deft touch, the wooden door swung open swiftly, granting us access to the apartment. Moving from the scullery to the kitchen, we settled comfortably in two chairs, leaving the door to the hall slightly ajar. ""Now, all that remains is to wait,"" Poirot remarked contently, closing his eyes. The wait felt interminable to me, as I dreaded the thought of succumbing to sleep.",1
"""I will definitely assist you in any way I can,"" the young soldier responded. ""Unfortunately, I did not observe anything unusual. Maltravers was a family friend, but I did not know him well personally."" ""When did you arrive?"" ""On Tuesday afternoon. I left for London early Wednesday morning, my boat departing from Tilbury around noon. However, I had to change my plans due to some news I received, as I mentioned to Mrs. Maltravers."" ""You were heading back to East Africa, correct?"" ""That's right. I've been there since the War - it's a remarkable country."" ""Indeed.""",1
"He paused for a moment, deep in thought, before getting up quickly. “You’re going back to Yardly Chase right away? Good! Don’t say a word to anyone except for expecting us there this evening. We’ll be there shortly after five.” “Okay, but I don’t understand” “It doesn’t matter,” said Poirot kindly. “You want me to keep your diamond safe, right?” “Yes, but” “Then just do as I say.” A confused nobleman left the room sadly. We arrived at Yardly Chase at half past five, following the butler to the hall with a roaring fire. Lady Yardly and her children were there, the mother bending over her kids. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler. Lady Yardly looked surprised, her husband looking to Poirot for guidance. “My apologies! I’m still investigating Miss Marvell’s case. She visited you on Friday, correct? I wanted to make sure everything was secure. And I wanted to ask Lady Yardly about the postmarks on her letters.” Lady Yardly couldn't remember. “Will you stay the night?” asked Lord Yardly. “Oh, my lord, I wouldn’t want to inconvenience you. Our bags are at the inn.” “No trouble at all,” insisted Lord Yardly. Poirot agreed and sat with Lady Yardly, playing with the children. “You’re a good mother,” said Poirot, bowing gallantly. A dressing gong rang, and we headed to our rooms. Suddenly, a telegram arrived, causing a stir among the guests. Lord Yardly handed it to his wife, who had a reaction. “I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said softly. “It’s been in the family for so long.” She left the room, and we gathered in the drawing-room, waiting for her. A few minutes later, Lady Yardly appeared in a stunning white dress, wearing a necklace. “Behold the sacrifice,” she said cheerfully, before the lights went out and chaos ensued. Lady Yardly was found on the floor, her necklace missing. A search led to the discovery of the necklace near the side door, missing a stone. “That settles it,” I whispered. “These were no ordinary thieves. They only wanted that one stone.” “But how did he get in?” “Through this door.” “But it’s always locked.” I opened the door, revealing a torn piece of silk. “In his hurry, it got caught in the door,” I explained. We searched but the thief had escaped in the darkness. Lord Yardly sent for the police, and Poirot comforted Lady Yardly. Later, we learned that Miss Marvell’s diamond had been stolen as well. Poirot realized his mistake and we rushed to the Magnificent to investigate. The thief had cleverly impersonated Mr. Rolf to steal the diamond. Poirot's plan to catch the thief had succeeded, and he returned the stolen diamond to Lord Yardly, leaving everyone bewildered by his methods.",1
"“As Hastings indicates, bodies tend to be discovered persistently.” “Moreover, a gardener mentioned spotting a silhouette heading towards the rose-garden from the side of the residence. The study's lengthy French window overlooks the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently used that entrance. However, the gardener was far away tending to cucumber frames, unable to confirm if it was his employer's figure. Additionally, the time is uncertain, but it was likely before six since the gardeners finish their work by then.” “Could it have been Mr.",1
"""We gazed at each other in stunned silence. The doctor's revelation was beyond belief, leaving us all in shock. Despite the dagger being recently stolen, Dr. Durand claimed that the victim had been dead for over forty-eight hours. It was a baffling situation to comprehend. As we tried to process this new information, a telegram arrived for me from Poirot, announcing his imminent return to Merlinville. Hastily opening the message, I learned that he would be arriving at 12:28. Realizing the urgency of informing Poirot about the latest developments in the case, I hurried to the station to meet him. His swift return from Paris indicated that he had found crucial information. Anticipating his reaction to the news, I waited anxiously at the station. The train was delayed, giving me time to inquire about the passengers who had left Merlinville on the night of the crime. Speaking to the chief porter, he adamantly denied that anyone matching the description of the suspects had left on the midnight train. However, a sudden thought crossed my mind, spurred by Marthe Daubreuil's anxious demeanor. I questioned whether M. Renauld had departed on that train, to which the porter confirmed that he had arrived in Merlinville on the 11:40 train. My mind raced with the implications of this revelation. Jack Renauld's presence in Merlinville on the night of the crime raised more questions. Why had he kept silent about his whereabouts? Marthe had been aware of his presence all along, explaining her anxious behavior. The arrival of Poirot interrupted my thoughts, and I greeted him eagerly. His jubilant demeanor quickly turned serious when I informed him of another murder. The shock on Poirot's face was palpable, dispelling any notion that he was already aware of the crime. His deduction about the victim's identity and cause of death left me dumbfounded. Poirot's astute reasoning and swift conclusions never failed to amaze me. As we proceeded to investigate the crime scene, Poirot's meticulous examination of the evidence revealed crucial details. The discovery of a woman's hair intertwined with the murder weapon added a new layer of intrigue to the case. Poirot's revelation about the victim's death being staged as a murder sent shockwaves through the group. His theory of an epileptic fit as the cause of death was met with skepticism and awe. Poirot's unwavering confidence in his deductions only added to the mystery. The mention of Madame Beroldy and her infamous past reignited memories of a long-forgotten trial, hinting at a connection to the current investigation. Poirot's cryptic remarks about the woman's identity left me eager to uncover the truth behind the enigmatic Madame Beroldy.""",1
"He observed me intently for a few moments. “Yes, I understand perfectly. And you are wise. Stick to your story.” “That seems to always be your advice,” I stated, slightly offended. “Ah, my friend, trust in Papa Poirot. One day, with your permission, I will arrange a marriage for you with great suitability.” “Thank you,” I chuckled, “but the idea doesn’t excite me.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “The English!” he muttered. “No method at all. They leave everything to chance!” He scowled, adjusting the position of the salt cellar. “You mentioned that Miss Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre, correct?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “Right, I forgot.” A brief moment of doubt crossed my mind. Had I ever told Poirot which hotel the girl was staying at? I glanced at him and felt reassured. He was meticulously cutting his bread into small squares, completely focused on the task. He must have assumed I had informed him of her whereabouts. We enjoyed coffee outside by the sea. Poirot smoked one of his miniature cigarettes before checking his watch. “The train to Paris departs at 2:25,” he noted. “I should get going.” “Paris?” I exclaimed. “Indeed, that’s what I said, my friend.” “You’re heading to Paris? But why?” He responded gravely. “To find the murderer of Mr. Renauld.” “You believe he’s in Paris?” “I am certain he is not. Nonetheless, that is where I must search for him. You don’t comprehend, but I will explain everything in due time. Trust me, this journey to Paris is imperative. I won’t be gone long. Most likely, I’ll return tomorrow. I don’t suggest you accompany me. Stay here and keep an eye on Giraud. Also, get to know Mr. Renauld’s son. And if you wish, try to win over Mademoiselle Marthe. Though, I doubt you’ll have much luck.” I wasn’t pleased with his last comment. “By the way,” I began, “I meant to ask how you knew about those two?” “My friend, I understand human nature. Put a boy like young Renauld together with a lovely girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the outcome is nearly inevitable. Then, the argument! It was either money or a woman, and recalling Léonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I went with the latter. So I made a guess, and I was correct.” “So that’s why you cautioned me against getting attached to the lady? You already suspected that she cared for young Renauld?” Poirot grinned. “At the very least, I noticed she had worried eyes. That’s how I always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil - the girl with the anxious eyes…” His tone was so serious that it made me uneasy. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I believe, my friend, that we will soon find out. But I must leave.” “You have plenty of time.” “Maybe maybe. But I prefer to have ample time at the station. I don’t want to rush, to hurry, to agitate myself.” “In any case,” I said, getting up, “I’ll come and see you off.” “You will do no such thing. I forbid it.” He was so authoritative that I stared at him in astonishment. He nodded firmly. “I mean it, my friend. Goodbye! May I embrace you? Oh, no, I forgot it’s not the English custom. A handshake, then.” After Poirot departed, I felt somewhat lost. I wandered down the beach, observing the swimmers, but lacking the energy to join in. I half expected Cinderella to be among them in some extravagant outfit, but she was nowhere to be seen. I aimlessly walked along the shore towards the other end of town. It occurred to me that, at the very least, it would be polite to inquire about the girl. And it would save me trouble in the long run. The issue would then be resolved. I wouldn’t have to worry about her anymore. But if I didn’t go at all, she might come looking for me at the Villa. And that would be inconvenient in every way. Without a doubt, it was better to pay a brief visit, during which I could make it clear that I could no longer assist her as a guide. So, I left the beach and headed inland. I soon located the Hôtel du Phare, a modest structure. It was incredibly frustrating not to know the lady’s name, and to save face, I decided to casually enter and look around. Most likely, I would find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small town - you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. A Casino was under construction, but it was not yet finished. Since I had traversed the entire beach without spotting her, she must be in the hotel. I entered. Several individuals were seated in the cramped lounge, but she was not among them. I peeked into other rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for a while, until impatience got the best of me. I discreetly approached the concierge, slipping him five francs. “I need to see a lady staying here. A young English lady, petite and dark-haired. I’m not certain of her name.” The man shook his head, barely concealing a smile. “There is no lady matching that description staying here.” “Perhaps she’s American,” I suggested. These people are so dim. But the man continued to shake his head. “No, sir. There are only six or seven English and American ladies here, and they are all older than the lady you’re looking for. You won’t find her here, sir.” His certainty made me doubt myself. “But the lady informed me she was staying here.” “You or the lady must have been mistaken, since another gentleman was here asking for her.” “What do you mean?” I asked, surprised. “Yes, sir. A gentleman described her just as you did.” “What was he like?” “He was a small, well-dressed man, very tidy, with a stiff mustache, a peculiarly shaped head, and green eyes.” Poirot! So that’s why he didn’t want me to go to the station with him.",1
""" The young man shook his head vigorously, and the judge, always eager to challenge Giraud, responded. “Not now. M. Bex will kindly bring it to us here.” The police commissioner exited the room. Stonor approached Jack, shaking his hand. Poirot stood up and straightened a pair of candlesticks that caught his attention. The judge re-read the mysterious love letter, holding onto his theory of jealousy and betrayal. Suddenly, the door swung open and the commissioner hurried in. “Judge! Judge!” “Yes.""",1
"I motioned for her to take a seat on the couch and urged her to share her troubles. She divulged every detail to me, taking care to not leave anything out. After I had listened intently, she let out a heavy breath. Surprisingly, she didn't react the way I had anticipated. Instead of scolding or criticizing, she simply chuckled and remarked, ""You know, Anne, you're quite an extraordinary young woman. Have you never felt any doubts?"" Perplexed, I inquired, ""Doubts?"" She repeated, ""Yes, doubts, doubts, doubts! Venturing out on your own with barely a penny to your name. What will you do if you end up in a foreign land with no money left?"" ""There's no use worrying about that until it happens,"" I replied.",1

"”Poirot handed me an old, worn-out book with the title, Ancient Rites and Rituals of the Occult. Without a word, he swiftly left the tent. The doctor turned to me, puzzled. “What’s his scheme now?” I chuckled at the familiar phrase coming from someone else’s mouth. “I’m not quite sure,” I admitted. “I think he’s planning to banish the dark forces somehow.” Determined to find out more, I sought out Poirot and discovered him deep in conversation with the gaunt young man who used to work for the deceased Mr. Bleibner. “No,” Mr.",1

Friday evening arrived, and my fears were confirmed - Mrs. Blair and Anne purchased forty-nine wooden animals. My journey to Rhodesia was thoroughly enjoyable.",1
"Leaving the girl hidden in the bushes, I made my way into the residence. Marchaud stood guard by the entrance to the salon. Inside, voices whispered in conversation. ""Is Monsieur in need of Hautet? He's inside, questioning Françoise once more."" ""No,"" I quickly replied, ""I have no use for him. However, I do require the key to the shed outside, if it's not forbidden."" ""But of course, monsieur."" He handed it over. ""Here you go. Judge M. ordered that you have full access to everything. Just return it to me once you're done, that's all."" ""Certainly.""",1
"""Could he have been responsible? Maintaining two vehicles, and Marsdon Manor is quite a large estate to manage, despite the bargain he secured."" ""I heard he suffered significant financial setbacks recently,"" Poirot mentioned, eyeing the doctor intently. However, the doctor simply shook his head sadly. ""Is that so? Well, luckily his wife is covered by life insurance. A lovely young woman, but deeply shaken by this tragedy. A bundle of nerves, poor thing. I've done my best to shield her from it all, but the shock was bound to be substantial."" ""You were treating Mr. Maltravers recently?"" ""My dear sir, I never treated him."" ""What?"" ""I believe Mr. Maltravers followed Christian Science or something along those lines."" ""But you conducted the examination?"" ""Of course. I was summoned by one of the gardeners."" ""And the cause of death was evident?"" ""Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding was internal."" ""Was he still in the same position he was found in?"" ""Yes, the body was untouched. He was lying near a small wooded area. It seems he had been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle was next to him. The hemorrhage must have occurred suddenly. Gastric ulcer, no doubt."" ""No suspicion of foul play, was there?"" ""My dear sir!"" ""I apologize,"" Poirot said humbly. ""But, if I remember correctly, in a recent murder case, the initial diagnosis was heart failure, only to be changed when the constable pointed out a bullet wound to the head!"" ""You won't find any bullet wounds on Mr. Maltravers' body,"" Dr. Bernard remarked dryly. ""Now, gentlemen, if there's nothing else..."" We took the hint. ""Good day, and thank you, doctor, for your cooperation. By the way, you saw no reason for an autopsy?"" ""Absolutely not."" The doctor seemed quite irritated. ""The cause of death was clear, and in my line of work, we see no need to unnecessarily upset the deceased's family."" And with that, the doctor abruptly shut the door in our faces. ""What are your thoughts on Dr. Bernard, Hastings?"" Poirot asked as we made our way to the Manor. ""Somewhat of a fool."" ""Exactly. Your judgments on character are always astute, my friend."" I felt uneasy at his words, but he appeared completely serious. However, a mischievous glint entered his eye, and he added teasingly, ""That is, unless a beautiful woman is involved!"" I looked at him icily. Upon reaching the manor, we were greeted by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She led us to a small morning-room and went to inform her mistress. After about ten minutes, the door opened, revealing a slender figure in mourning attire standing in the doorway. ""Monsieur Poirot?"" she hesitated. ""Madame!"" Poirot leaped up gallantly and approached her. ""I cannot express how sorry I am to intrude on you like this.""",1
"As he dictated to Miss Pettigrew, her voice droned on monotonously. ""I therefore suggest that in addressing this issue of colored labor,"" she repeated. After a pause, he grunted something angrily.

Hurriedly, I exited the hotel and headed towards the bridge. Crossing it, I positioned myself in the shadows, ready and watchful. If someone followed me, I would spot them as they crossed the bridge.",1

Suddenly, the man pivoted, as if considering retracing his path on the platform. His gaze briefly met mine before shifting to a point beyond, causing a sudden transformation in his expression - one of terror bordering on sheer panic.",1
"""I see it as the most effective approach."" ""Appreciate it, Sir Eustace."" ""Could it be her spouse? Husbands can be quite bothersome. They always appear at the most inconvenient times."" ""I am confused, Sir Eustace. Whose spouse are you referring to?"" ""The woman's spouse."" ""Which woman?"" ""Heavens, Pagett, the woman from your encounter in Florence. Surely there was a woman involved. You can't tell me you only burglarized a church or attacked an Italian because you didn't like his appearance."" ""I am completely bewildered, Sir Eustace.

"As I stepped out of the train onto Adderly Street, a sense of unease settled over me. I could feel the eyes of my watcher boring into the back of my head, a constant reminder of the danger that surrounded me. I knew I couldn't continue to play the game alone - my enemies were too numerous and too close. The time had come to change my tactics. Sitting down at Cartwright's, I ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas, finding solace in the sweet, cold liquid as I contemplated my next move. A man might have turned to a stiff drink for courage, but for me, the comfort of an ice-cream soda was enough to steady my nerves. With each sip, I steeled myself for the challenges that lay ahead.",1

When I awoke, I found myself just outside of Bulawayo, confronted by a grotesque wooden giraffe with elongated legs and neck. Despite these minor setbacks, everything had been proceeding smoothly until a new disaster struck. The incident occurred on the evening of our arrival at the Falls.

An absurd inquiry, considering I had no control over the girl's whereabouts.",1
"I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied, “My cabin is intended to sleep in, and to attempt to dress in. I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work.” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir larger.” “I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed. He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What was the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. Something Ah! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17.",1
"We bid you goodnight, Monsieur Poirot. I see the wheels turning in your mind,"" Poirot smiled. ""I would be happy to join you. Hastings, go fetch a taxi,"" he said. Taxis always seem scarce when you're in a hurry, but we managed to find one and headed towards Regent's Park. Regent's Court, a modern apartment building near St. John's Wood Road, was our destination. The building was equipped with all the latest technology. The hallway was empty. The doctor impatiently rang the bell for the lift, and when it arrived, he interrogated the attendant about the location of Flat II.",1
"""What do you mean by ‘vanish’? To which category of vanishing are you alluding?” “Are vanishings organized and categorized, then?” I chuckled. Japp grinned as well. Poirot scowled at us both. “But of course they are! They are divided into three groups: First, and most frequent, the deliberate vanishing act. Second, the often falsified ‘amnesia’ scenario, uncommon, but occasionally legitimate. Third, homicide, and the more or less effective disposal of the corpse. Do you consider all three as unattainable?” “Almost certainly, I would say. You may lose your own memory, but someone would surely identify you particularly in the instance of a prominent figure like Davenheim.”",1
"In some mysterious manner, I found myself in a perilous situation. There was a piece of information, real or perceived, that made others desperate to eliminate me, and it was somehow connected to the valuable diamonds. I was convinced that one individual, The Man in the Brown Suit named Harry Rayburn, held the missing puzzle piece. However, he had disappeared into the shadows, evading capture. It was unlikely that our paths would cross again. Shaking off sentimental thoughts of Harry Rayburn, I refocused on the present circumstances.",1
"Honestly, I despise early humans, whether they be Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or any other kind. Despite working on Papa's book about Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors, I can't help but feel repulsed by Neanderthal men themselves. It's a relief that they went extinct so long ago. I doubt Papa ever realized my true feelings, and even if he did, he wouldn't have cared. He was never concerned with the opinions of others, which I believe was a testament to his greatness. Similarly, he lived completely removed from the mundane aspects of everyday life.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, with everyone fast asleep. As we stood beneath Mrs. Renauld's open window, a cry for help shattered the stillness. A light flickered in a nearby room as a struggle ensued. Poirot sprang into action, scaling a tree with feline agility. I followed, watching as Cinderella, the acrobat, swung effortlessly towards the danger. In a daring rescue, she averted a tragedy just in time. The scene unfolded, revealing the sinister truth behind the murder of M. Renauld and the attempted murder of his wife. The pieces fell into place, leading us to the unexpected culprit, Marthe Daubreuil. Through a series of clever deductions, the mystery was unraveled, exposing the cold-blooded motives of a calculating killer.",1
"""But, Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls, though I only found out yesterday."" ""You knew!"" I exclaimed. ""Interestingly enough, it was Pagett who spilled the beans. He droned on about a pointless story involving a bet and a tin of films. It didn't take me long to connect the dots - Mrs. Blair's suspicion of Colonel Race, her nervousness, her plea for me to look after her souvenirs. The eager Pagett had already opened the cases. So, before exiting the hotel, I discreetly moved all the film rolls into my own pocket. They're right over there in the corner.""",1
"I presented myself as a potential renter. My target was the local real estate agents, who had a limited number of properties available. However, I underestimated my opponent. A friendly clerk provided details on several attractive properties. I had to use all my cunning to come up with flaws for each one. In the end, I was afraid I had hit a dead end. ""Do you have anything else?"" I inquired, feigning desperation. ""Perhaps something by the river, with a sizable garden and a small lodge,"" I mentioned, summarizing the key features of the Mill House, based on my research.",1
"“Poirot, we need your help urgently,” Lord Estair said, his face grave. “The Prime Minister has disappeared, kidnapped on his way to France for an important conference. We must act quickly.” Poirot's brow furrowed as he listened to the details of the case. The Prime Minister's car had been ambushed, shots fired, and the driver, O’Murphy, had taken a detour off the main road, only to disappear later. The Secretary, Daniels, was found bound and gagged, but alive. There were too many unanswered questions, too many variables to consider. Poirot pondered over the situation, weighing the facts carefully. “This is a dark and complex case,” he muttered to himself. “We must proceed with caution and method.”",1
"“As I mentioned before,” I began, “the second dagger discovered in the tramp belonged to Mrs. Renauld. This means there were two identical daggers in total.” Poirot nodded in agreement. “Indeed, and given that they were duplicates, it is logical to assume that Jack Renauld was the owner. However, what truly concerns me is the issue of psychological heredity, mon ami, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, ultimately, is the offspring of Georges Conneau.” His tone was serious and sincere, leaving me somewhat impressed. “What was that idea you mentioned earlier?” I inquired. Poirot checked his watch, then asked, “What time does the afternoon boat from Calais depart?” “Around five, I believe.” “That should work perfectly. We will have just enough time.” “Are you heading to England?” “Yes, my friend.” “For what reason?” “To track down a potential witness.” “Who?” Poirot responded with a slightly enigmatic smile, “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how do you plan to locate her? What do you know about her?” “I may not have much information about her, but I can make some educated guesses. It is likely that her name is Bella Duveen, and considering that M. Stonor found it vaguely familiar, though not in connection to the Renauld family, it is probable that she is involved in the theater. Jack Renauld, a young man of considerable wealth, and twenty years old. The theater would have been his first love. It also aligns with M. Renauld’s attempt to appease her with a check. I am confident I will find her, especially with this.” Poirot revealed the photograph he had taken from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scribbled in one corner, but what captured my attention was not the message. The image, although not of the highest quality, was unmistakable to me. A sense of dread washed over me, as if some unimaginable disaster had occurred. It was Cinderella's face. I sat frozen for a moment, the photograph still in my grasp. Eventually, I composed myself and handed it back, stealing a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? Thankfully, he seemed oblivious to any unusual behavior. Anything out of the ordinary in my demeanor had evidently gone unnoticed by him. He promptly got up. “We must depart quickly. We have no time to waste. The sea will be calm!” Amidst the commotion of our departure, I had no opportunity for reflection, but once aboard the ship, shielded from Poirot’s scrutiny (as he was, as usual, ""practising the method most excellent of Laverguier""), I gathered my thoughts and analyzed the situation objectively. How much did Poirot truly know? Was he aware that my fellow traveler and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he visited the Hôtel du Phare? Was it for my benefit as I had assumed? Or had I foolishly believed so, and was this visit for a deeper, more sinister purpose? But regardless, why was he so determined to find this young lady? Did he suspect her of witnessing Jack Renauld commit the crime? But that was inconceivable! The girl had no reason to harm the elder Renauld, no motive to desire his death. What had led her back to the scene of the murder? I meticulously reviewed the facts. She likely disembarked the train at Calais, where we parted ways that day. It made sense that I couldn't locate her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais and then taken a train to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève around the time Françoise mentioned. What transpired when she left the residence shortly after ten? Presumably, she either checked into a hotel or returned to Calais. And then? The crime occurred on Tuesday night. By Thursday morning, she was back in Merlinville. Did she ever leave France at all? I highly doubted it. What was keeping her there, the hope of reuniting with Jack Renauld? I had informed her (believing it at the time) that he was en route to Buenos Ayres on the high seas. Perhaps she knew the Anzora had not set sail. But to be aware of that, she must have seen Jack. Was that Poirot's objective? Had Jack Renauld, returning to meet Marthe Daubreuil, unexpectedly encountered Bella Duveen, the girl he had callously rejected? Things were beginning to make sense. If that was indeed the case, it could provide Jack with the alibi he required. Yet, under those circumstances, his silence was perplexing. Why didn't he speak up boldly? Was he afraid that this former relationship of his would come to light to Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. It had been a harmless, foolish romance between two young individuals, and I cynically considered that the son of a millionaire was unlikely to be abandoned by an impoverished French girl who loved him deeply, without a significant reason. Overall, I found the situation perplexing and unsatisfactory. I strongly disliked being involved with Poirot in the pursuit of this girl, but I couldn't see a way out of it without divulging everything to him, something I was reluctant to do for some unknown reason. Poirot reappeared lively and cheerful upon our arrival in Dover, and our trip to London was uneventful. It was well past nine o’clock when we reached our destination, and I assumed we would head straight to our accommodations and wait until morning. However, Poirot had different plans. “We must act swiftly, mon ami. While the news of the arrest won't be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, we mustn't delay.” I didn't quite grasp his reasoning, but I simply inquired about his strategy to locate the girl.",1
"""I was completely shaken the next morning, feeling the urgency to investigate. I came face to face with the dead man, a striking resemblance to Jack, donning his distinctive overcoat. The unmistakable paper knife, a gift from Jack to Bella, was there too. My only thought was to possess that dagger and escape undetected. Feigning a fainting spell, I seized the weapon and concealed it on my person. I claimed to be staying at Hôtel du Phare, but in reality, I swiftly returned to Calais and then sailed to England. As the boat crossed the Channel, I disposed of the dagger, feeling a sense of relief. ""Back in London, Bella's appearance was distressing. I confessed my actions to her, providing some temporary security. Her unsettling laughter echoed in the room, propelling me to keep her occupied. A chance performance provided us with an opportunity to distract ourselves. ""Upon spotting you and your companion observing us that night, panic set in. Your pursuit indicated suspicion, leading me to tail you. My anxiety peaked as I realized that you mistook me for Bella, assuming I had taken the dagger. ""Reflecting on that moment, my fear and desperation clouded my judgment. I harbored doubts about your intentions, torn between saving me or her. Believing it was best to prioritize Bella, my deception continued. Regrets linger, questioning if trust in you would have altered the outcome. ""The news of Jack Renauld's arrest sealed Bella's fate. Exhausted, I couldn't continue writing. Signed as Cinderella but changed to Dulcie Duveen, the letter remains a poignant reminder of past events. Poirot, present during my reading, unveiled the truth. The sisters' resemblance, highlighted by Bella's wig, had misled us all along. ""Poirot's explanation shed light on his silence, testing my feelings and commitment. Handing him the letter, I sought answers. Concerned by Dulcie's ambiguous sentiments, Poirot reassured me of her love. With a French stamp as the only clue, I entrusted Poirot to locate her. ""In a heartfelt reunion, Poirot congratulated Jack on his release, accompanied by a grateful handshake. Despite his freedom, Jack's distress was evident, weighed down by guilt and uncertainty. As he prepared to reunite with Marthe and his mother, the shadow of Bella's future loomed large. Poirot's advice offered a glimmer of hope amidst the turmoil, emphasizing the leniency of French courts and the potential for extenuating circumstances. Jack's remorse and self-blame for his father's death lingered, overshadowing his relief from escaping the guillotine.""",1
"He refrained from entering, opting instead to linger near the bench mentioned earlier, positioned a short distance from it. After a brief contemplation, he walked cautiously from the bench to the hedgerow separating Villa Geneviève from Villa Marguerite. He retraced his steps, nodding in approval. Moving back to the hedgerow, he pushed aside the bushes with his hands. ""If luck is on my side,"" he whispered to me, ""Mademoiselle Marthe might be in the garden. I need to speak with her without drawing attention at the Villa Marguerite.""",1
"The man's death is under investigation. Madame Daubreuil is questioned about her relationship with him, but she denies any involvement. Madame Daubreuil is characterized as yielding yet seductive, and she insists on being present during the questioning. The examining magistrate insinuates that she may have known more than she lets on, but she remains defiant and refuses to cooperate, ultimately kicking them out of her house. The magistrate and Poirot part ways, with Poirot commenting on the thoroughness of the French police system.",1
"""Let's not risk it. I'll catch the next train out of here. I don't want Giraud sniffing around the Villa."" ""Understood. Head straight to the station,"" Poirot instructed. As Renauld prepared to leave, Poirot interjected, ""Wait a minute, M. Renauld. There's something that doesn't add up. Why keep your presence in Merlinville a secret from M. Hautet?"" Renauld's face turned red, but he quickly regained his composure. ""You must be mistaken. I clearly stated to the magistrate that I was in Cherbourg that night.""",1
"In the corner by the fire-place stood a large writing-table. A man, or what once was a man, sat at the table. His right hand clutched the telephone base, but he lay forward, felled by a brutal blow to the head from behind. The murder weapon was easily found - a marble statuette with a bloodstained base. The doctor’s swift examination confirmed the worst. ""Stone dead. Death was quick. Surprising he even had time to make a call. Best not to disturb the body until the police come."" Following the manager's advice, we combed through the apartment, but the outcome was inevitable.",1
"""But what about the crime passionnel? Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head. “If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked men, the ‘secret,’ the papers!” Poirot smiled a little. “Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably. But reflect now on something very curious. It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale if it were all would indeed be plain sailing it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.” “Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “Mon ami, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to the facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason not like Giraud but like Hercule Poirot.” “But are you sure?” “My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile. But at last I see clearly.” “You know everything?” “I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.” “And you know the murderer?” “I know one murderer.” “What do you mean?” “We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but two. The first I have solved, the second eh bien, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was omniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.” “You don’t think ” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too horrible!” Poirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants there was, with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one man Jack Renauld. And a man must have dug a grave.… I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad. “That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot. “There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you not to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an inkling of your errand.” “Very well, I will go straight to the station.” He rose to his feet. Poirot’s voice stopped him. “One moment, M. Renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me.",1
"I struggled for what felt like an eternity to free myself from the tight bonds that held me captive. Through sheer determination, I managed to cut through the ropes around my wrists, restoring feeling to my hands. As I cautiously made my way through the deserted house, I overheard a conversation that sent chills down my spine. The mention of diamonds and secret information piqued my curiosity, but also filled me with dread. It was clear that danger lurked in the shadows, and I knew I had to tread carefully. Time was running out, and I needed to find a way out before it was too late.",1
"The young woman, with a ghoulish mind, was fascinated by the gruesome details of the murder case. Despite my initial disapproval, I found myself reluctantly intrigued by her morbid curiosity. As we entered the shed where the body lay, her high spirits vanished, replaced by horror. She had ignored my warnings, and now she was paying the price. I showed her the victim's fatal wound, a dagger protruding from his back, which caused her to faint. Rushing to her aid, I fetched water and brandy to revive her, realizing that she had underestimated the reality of the crime scene. After she recovered, she begged me to take her away from the scene of death, shaken to her core by what she had witnessed.",1
"""The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve."" The chauffeur thanked him and started the car once more. My gaze was captivated by the woman who remained standing, her hand resting on the gate, observing us. A true epitome of beauty, she was impossible to overlook. Towering in stature, possessing the allure of a youthful deity, her shimmering golden locks glistening in the sunlight, I silently acknowledged her as one of the most exquisite women I had ever beheld. As we ascended the rugged path, I glanced back in her direction. ""Goodness, Poirot,"" I remarked, ""did you catch sight of that stunning young woman?""",1
"""Both individuals are currently in a state of suspension. I have shed my skirts and my fabric as well. Why not take a seat?” I calmly settled into a chair. “It appears,” I observed, “that I may have arrived at an incorrect location.” “Unfortunately, from your perspective, that seems to be the case. Miss Beddingfeld, falling into the same snare twice!” “Not the wisest move on my part,” I confessed humbly. There was something about my demeanor that seemed to puzzle him. “You don’t appear to be bothered by what happened,” he dryly remarked. “Would a dramatic reaction from me make any difference to you?” I inquired.",1
"As I turned the corner, I realized that despite having Cinderella's address, I was still clueless about her name. Inside the Salon, the examining magistrate was deep in conversation with the elderly gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary acknowledged my presence with a smile and a nod. Taking a seat discreetly, I observed M. Hautet's thorough and detailed questioning, yet he failed to uncover any significant information. Auguste confessed that the gardening gloves were his own, explaining that he used them when tending to a specific type of primula plant that was toxic to certain individuals.",1
"""Upon reflection, it seems that we have overlooked someone,"" I declared, earning a nod of agreement from Poirot. ""Georges Conneau!"" Poirot's eyes twinkled as he embraced me warmly. ""Enfin! You have arrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning. You are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau."" Encouraged by his approval, I continued, ""Georges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to believe that he is dead."" ""Aucunement,"" Poirot concurred. ""Therefore we will assume that he is alive."" ""Exactly."" ""Or that he was alive until recently."" ""De mieux en mieux!"" ""We will presume,"" I continued with growing enthusiasm, ""that he has fallen on evil days. He has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp a what you will. He chances to come to Merlinville. There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love."" ""Eh eh! The sentimentality,"" warned Poirot. ""Where one hates one also loves,"" I quoted or misquoted. ""At any rate he finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old wrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it likely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and Conneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there suddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. Now supposing Jack Renauld to appear. Madame Daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful consequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived. His father's murderer is dead let them do their best to hush it up. Jack Renauld consents goes to the house and has an interview with his mother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?"" Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. ""I think that you should write for the Kinema, mon ami,"" he remarked at last. ""You mean ?"" ""It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me there but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life."" ""I admit that I haven't gone into all the details, but "" ""You have gone further you have ignored them magnificently. What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?"" ""I don't see that that matters,"" I objected rather huffily. ""He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day."" ""By threats eh? You seriously advance that supposition?"" ""Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter's marriage."" ""You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the whip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine."" I was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this. ""Your theory,"" I remarked acidly, ""is doubtless correct as to all the details?"" ""My theory is the truth,"" said Poirot quietly. ""And the truth is necessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You permitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight assignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we must take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?"" ""Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!"" Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. ""I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the 'Russians' was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau."" ""Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us."" ""Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to note down?"" ""The letter to you?"" ""That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning of the case. The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May."" Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. ""23rd May. M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter's wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. ""24th May. M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife's hands. ""7th June. Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. ""Letter written to M. Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance. ""Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the Anzora to Buenos Ayres. ""Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday. ""Visit of a lady, that evening.""",1
"I observed him carefully, noting his official demeanor as a high-ranking member of the Secret Service. It was evident that he was on a mission to apprehend the elusive figure known as the ""Colonel."" As I pieced together the puzzle in my mind, it became increasingly apparent to me. But where did I fit into this intricate web of deceit and treachery? Were the valuable diamonds the sole motivation behind the relentless pursuit to eliminate me? I could not bring myself to believe it. There was something more at play here, something far greater than a mere heist.",1
"Mr. MacAdam, a weak-throated man, carefully preserved his voice before important speeches. The deception was maintained until reaching France, where it became impractical. The Prime Minister's disappearance led the police across the Channel, diverting attention from the initial attack. To maintain the illusion of the abduction in France, Daniels was effectively gagged and chloroformed. The impostor Prime Minister and his fake chauffeur were eventually released due to lack of evidence, while the real Prime Minister and O'Murphy sought refuge with 'Mrs. Everard' in Hampstead. Poirot's keen observation skills led him to uncover the truth, much to his satisfaction.",1
"She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.” “By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why ” I began. “No ‘whys,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered. Arrived at the Villa Geneviève, Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But ” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the ” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right-hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “Mille tonnerres!” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!” A cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear tones came the words: “No, you don’t! I’ve got you and my wrists are just like steel.” At the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by Françoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door. “It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.” There was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale, beckoned us in. “She is safe?” demanded Poirot. “Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.” Mrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping for breath. “Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong. “A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at the door. Where is the other?” The girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil! ve confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you must have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room her boudoir,” he explained. “But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you why was I not told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child ” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour slightly to my annoyance.",1
"""I knew Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent. I helped him with a Japanese wrestler once. He might be able to help us find what we're looking for. It took a while to find Mr. Aarons, but he was willing to assist us. We asked for a young girl named Bella Duveen. Mr. Aarons recognized her as part of the Dulcibella Kids. He informed us that they were performing in Coventry. We headed there and watched their act, which received applause. After the show, Cinderella approached me, scared and in tears. She confessed to taking the dagger because she was afraid of fingerprints on it. I reassured her and confessed my love for her, promising not to turn her in to the police.""",1
"""But indeed, I declare it, a curse! They must summon M. le curé to bring holy water. I will never spend another night under that roof. It may be my turn, who can say?” She made the sign of the cross. “Yes,” I exclaimed, “but who has been murdered?” “How should I know? A man, a stranger. They discovered him up there in the shed not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed, stabbed to the heart with the same dagger!” Without waiting for more, I dashed up the path to the shed. The two guards stood aside to let me through and, filled with anticipation, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a simple wooden structure to store old pots and tools. I had entered impulsively, but as I stepped inside, I was captivated by the scene before me. Giraud was on his hands and knees, a flashlight in hand, examining every inch of the ground. He glanced up with a scowl when I entered, then his expression softened slightly. “Ah, it’s the Englishman! Come in. Let’s see what you can deduce from this situation.” Slightly stung by his tone, I lowered my head and entered. “There he is,” Giraud pointed with his flashlight to the far corner. I approached. The dead man lay flat on his back. He was of average height, with a dark complexion, possibly around fifty years old. He was dressed neatly in a dark blue suit, well-tailored and likely made by a high-end tailor, but not brand new. His face was contorted, and a dagger stood out from just above his heart, black and gleaming. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen in the glass jar the day before! “I’m expecting the doctor any moment,” Giraud said. “Although we hardly need him. It’s clear how the man died. He was stabbed in the heart, and death must have been almost instant.” “When do you think it happened? Last night?” Giraud shook his head. “Unlikely. I’m no expert on medical matters, but the man has been dead for well over twelve hours. When did you last see that dagger?” “Around ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I would guess the crime took place not long after that.” “But people were coming and going past this shed all the time.” Giraud laughed scornfully. “You are making remarkable progress! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well” I felt flustered. “I I assumed.” “Oh, what a brilliant detective! Look at him, my young friend does a man who has been stabbed in the heart fall neatly with his feet together and arms at his sides? No. Does a man lie down on his back and allow himself to be stabbed without trying to defend himself? It’s absurd, isn’t it? But look here and here” He shone the light on the ground. I noticed strange, irregular marks in the soft soil. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their footprints do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have made an effort to erase them, but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are gone, how do you know?” “Because, even though they are blurred, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable. Also, by this” And, leaning forward, he removed something from the dagger's handle and showed it to me. It was a long strand of black hair, similar to the one Poirot had found on the armchair in the library. With a slightly mocking smile, he wound it back around the dagger. “We will leave things as undisturbed as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. Well, do you notice anything else?” I had to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discolored, the skin was rough. It didn’t reveal much to me. I looked up at Giraud. “These are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, in response to my gaze. “Yet his clothes suggest he was wealthy. That’s peculiar, isn’t it?” “Very peculiar,” I agreed. “And none of his clothes have any identifying marks. What can we infer from that? This man was trying to disguise his true identity. He was masquerading. Why? Was he afraid of something? Was he trying to escape by pretending to be someone else? We don’t know yet, but one thing is clear he was as eager to conceal his identity as we are to uncover it.” He looked back at the body. “Once again, there are no fingerprints on the dagger’s handle. The killer must have worn gloves again.” “Do you think, then, that the same person committed both murders?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became unreadable. “Never mind what I think. Time will tell. Marchaud!” The police officer appeared at the door. “Monsieur?” “Why isn’t Madame Renauld here? I sent for her fifteen minutes ago.” “She is coming up the path now, sir, with her son.” “Good. I only want one of them at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and left. A moment later, he returned with Mrs. Renauld. “Here is Madame.” Giraud stepped forward with a brief nod. “This way, madame.” He escorted her over and then, suddenly stepping aside. “Here is the man. Do you recognize him?” And as he spoke, his eyes drilled into her face, trying to decipher her thoughts, noting every nuance of her reaction. But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly composed almost too composed, I thought. She looked down at the body with almost no interest, certainly no sign of shock or familiarity. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him before. He is a complete stranger to me.” “Are you certain?” “Absolutely.” “You don’t see him as one of the attackers, for example?” “No,” she hesitated, as if struck by the idea.",1
"Deep down, he's all about business, that man! He seduced Lady Yardly, then he extorted money from her. I confronted her about it last night, and she confessed. She claimed it was just a mistake, and I trust her. But, Rolf definitely had some of her letters that could be misconstrued. Fearing a divorce and losing her kids, she caved to his demands. With no savings of her own, she had no choice but to let him swap the genuine gem for a fake one.",1
"Marthe Daubreuil had a plan, but it was thwarted by a struggle with Madame Renauld. Although Marthe tried to make it look like suicide, she was checkmated by another woman with strong hands. Poirot suspected Marthe from the start, based on her anxious eyes. Madame Renauld's son, Jack, was kept in the dark about his father's past until Poirot revealed the truth. Jack decided to start a new life in South America with his mother. Poirot advised him to be honest with his love interest, Bella, and to ask for her forgiveness. In the end, Poirot received a visit from a film star, Mary Marvell, who was being threatened over a valuable diamond. Poirot advised her to keep the diamond safe until the threat had passed.",1
"“Ah, I see you're already familiar with the recent events,” remarked the detective, his expression unchanged. “I am always well-informed,” replied the inspector calmly. “But there is one detail that has likely escaped your notice,” interjected the officer, eager to display his expertise. He proceeded to recount the peculiar encounter with the unknown individual the previous evening, mentioning the peculiar check made out to ""Duveen"" and concluding with the letter signed ""Bella."" The detective listened attentively, examined the letter meticulously, and returned it without a word. “Fascinating, Monsieur. However, my original hypothesis remains unaltered.""",1
"""So we have come to the conclusion that Madame Renauld fabricated the truth out of love for a man, specifically Georges Conneau. Do you agree with this assessment?"" ""Yes,"" I confessed. ""It does make sense."" ""Good! Madame Renauld's affection lies with Georges Conneau. But who is Georges Conneau?"" ""The vagrant."" ""Do we have any proof that Madame Renauld cared for the vagrant?"" ""No, but..."" ""In that case, let go of theories that lack evidence. Instead, consider who Madame Renauld truly loved."" I shook my head in confusion. ""But of course, you already know.""",1
"""But indeed, I declare it, a curse! They must summon M. le curé to bring holy water. Never shall I spend another night under that roof. It may be my turn next, who can say?""

They discovered him up there in the shed not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that's not all. He was stabbed, stabbed in the heart with the same dagger!""

Let's see what you can deduce from this situation."" Slightly stung by his tone, I lowered my head and went inside. ""There he is,"" Giraud said, shining his light towards the far corner. I approached. The lifeless body lay flat on its back. He was of average height, dark-skinned, and perhaps around fifty years old. He was dressed neatly in a dark blue suit, well-tailored and likely from an expensive tailor, but not new. His face was contorted in agony, and on his left side, just above the heart, the dagger's hilt protruded, dark and gleaming. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen in the glass jar the day before! ""I'm expecting the doctor any moment,"" Giraud stated. ""Although we hardly need him. There's no question about the cause of death. He was stabbed in the heart, and death must have been almost instantaneous."" ""When did it happen? Last night?"" Giraud shook his head. ""Unlikely. I'm no expert on medical evidence, but the man has been dead for more than twelve hours. When did you last see that dagger?"" ""Around ten o'clock yesterday morning."" ""Then I would guess the crime took place not long after that."" ""But people were constantly passing by this shed."" Giraud chuckled unpleasantly. ""You're making remarkable progress! Who said he was killed in this shed?"" ""Well,"" I felt flustered. ""I I assumed so."" ""Oh, what a brilliant detective! Look at him, my young friend. Does a man stabbed in the heart fall neatly like that with his feet together and his arms at his sides? No. Would a man lie down on his back and allow himself to be stabbed without defending himself?

""Yet his clothes belong to a prosperous man. That's peculiar, isn't it?"" ""Very peculiar,"" I concurred. ""And none of his garments are labeled. What does that tell us? This man was trying to pass himself off as someone else. He was masquerading. Why? Was he afraid of something? Was he attempting to flee by disguising himself?

""Once again, there are no fingerprints on the dagger's handle. The killer wore gloves again."" ""So you believe the murderer was the same in both cases?"" I inquired eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. ""Never mind what I believe. We'll see. Marchaud!"" The policeman appeared at the doorway. ""Monsieur?"" ""Why isn't Madame Renauld here yet?

But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly composed, too composed, I thought. She gazed down at the corpse almost disinterestedly, definitely showing no sign of shock or recognition. ""No,"" she said. ""I have never seen him before. He is a total stranger to me."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Completely."" ""Do you not see one of your attackers in him, for example?"" ""No,"" she seemed to pause, as if struck by the idea.",1
"And the woman disappeared into thin air. Her box was left behind, containing only ordinary apparel. Mrs. Havering hired her through Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency with impeccable references. Mrs. Middleton's sudden disappearance raised suspicions, leading to an investigation. It was discovered that no woman named ""Mrs. Middleton"" had ever been registered with the Agency. Poirot deduced that Zoe Havering, a former actress, had orchestrated the whole scheme. She had disguised herself as the housekeeper to provide an alibi for her mistress. The clever and daring Zoe had fooled everyone with her quick changes and deception.",1
"Meanwhile, the battle rages on."" ""I hope,"" I mused, ""that only those deserving are the ones meeting their demise. Those who truly sought conflict, not innocent residents caught in the crossfire."" He nodded in agreement. ""I understand your sentiment, Anne. The injustice of war. But I have something else to share with you."" ""What is it?"" ""I must confess my own failure. Pedler has successfully fled."" ""What?"" ""Indeed. His escape remains a mystery to all.""",1
"I simply requested daily reports and obedience to my wired instructions, to which you agreed. Shortly after, I found myself across from Mr. Havering on a first-class carriage of the Midland Railway, swiftly departing from London. Firstly, Captain Hastings, it is essential that you grasp the fact that Hunter’s Lodge, the location of the tragic event, is merely a small shooting-box nestled in the Derbyshire moors. Our primary residence is near Newmarket, while we typically lease a flat in town during the season.",1
"I buried my nose in a bunch of violets and felt better. The attractive Mrs. Blair, a well-known society lady, caught my attention. She snubbed those who tried to scrape acquaintance, focusing her attention on a silent man. The next morning, Mrs. Blair led me to change cabins, but a dispute arose with Rev. Chichester and Mr. Pagett over Cabin 17. A terrible smell in my cabin turned out to be asafœtida, making me suspicious of the number 17. I decided to stay in the cabin, convinced that something would happen at one o'clock. The suspenseful night seemed endless as I waited for the unknown event.",1
"""The plea was desperate, but I had no other choice. I had to reach out to him, to beg for his help. I couldn't bear the thought of Jack being taken away from me. The pain was unbearable. I needed Poirot by my side, to unravel the truth behind this madness that threatened to consume us. Little did I know that the secrets hidden beneath the surface would soon be brought to light. Poirot's questions pierced through my soul, revealing a tangled web of deceit and betrayal. And as the truth slowly emerged, I found myself on my knees, begging for salvation.""",1
"""Now, let's talk about our targets. Mr. Chichester is heading to Durban. Sir Eustace plans to stay at the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town before heading to Rhodesia. He even offered me a spot in his private rail car after a few too many glasses of champagne the other night. I doubt he meant it, but he'll have to follow through if I remind him."" ""Sounds good,"" I replied. ""I'll focus on keeping an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, while you handle Chichester. What about Colonel Race?"" Suzanne gave me a strange look. ""Anne, you can't seriously suspect-"" ""I do. I suspect everyone. I'm in the mood to consider the most unlikely person.""",1
"""Make haste to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines. Request the loan of a woman with captivating eyes, amenable to hand-holding,” instructed Sir Eustace. The secretary nodded, “A skilled short-hand-typist shall be sought.” Sir Eustace scowled, “Pagett is vexing. He'll likely select a displeasing woman to vex me further. Don't forget, she must possess dainty feet.” Excitedly, I grasped Suzanne's hand and led her to her quarters. ""Suzanne, time is of the essence. We must devise our plans swiftly.""",1
"Rushing into the bedroom at the sound of faint moans, she was met with a horrifying scene. Madame Beroldy was on the floor, her hands and feet tied, emitting weak cries after managing to remove the gag from her mouth. Meanwhile, Monsieur Beroldy lay on the bed, surrounded by a pool of blood, a knife plunged into his heart. Madame Beroldy recounted the harrowing events that had unfolded - two masked figures had startled her awake, restraining and silencing her before turning their attention to Monsieur Beroldy in search of a mysterious ""secret"".",1
"We made our way there on camels, the creatures kneeling patiently as we prepared to mount. Surrounding us were several boys, led by a talkative dragoman. I won't dwell on the sight of Poirot on a camel. His journey began with groans and ended with screams, gestures, and prayers to the Virgin Mary and all the saints. Eventually, he gave up and traveled the rest of the way on a small donkey. I have to say, riding a trotting camel is no laughing matter. I was sore for days.",1
"""If you find the location to your liking, I suggest you put in an offer. Would you like me to draft an order for you?"" ""Yes, please."" Fifteen minutes later, I arrived at the entrance of the Mill House. When I knocked, the door swung open and a tall woman in her middle years practically jumped out. ""No one is allowed inside the house, do you understand? I've had my fill of reporters. Sir Eustace has given strict orders"" ""I was under the impression the house was available for rent,"" I stated coldly, handing over my order.",1
"“Interesting,” he whispered. “We all possess the little grey cells. Yet, so few of us know how to utilize them. Good day, Signor Ascanio. Your account aligns closely with my assumptions. However, verification was necessary.” After showing his visitor to the door, Poirot settled back into his armchair and grinned in my direction. “Shall we listen to M. le Capitaine Hastings's take on the matter?” “I suppose Ascanio is correct, someone did impersonate him.” “You persist in neglecting to use the intelligence bestowed upon you. Reflect on certain remarks I made upon exiting the apartment that evening. I made note of the undrawn window curtains.”",1
"""Indeed, my dear friend, I am at a loss. My mind is clouded by the darkness of this situation,"" Poirot murmured, his hands deftly arranging his belongings in a small suitcase. ""I pray that we will be able to act in time, but the shadows grow deeper."" I watched as the Ministers departed, closing the door behind them. Turning to Poirot, I inquired urgently, ""What is your assessment of the situation?"" His response was measured, ""I am unable to draw a conclusion at this moment. My thoughts elude me."" Reflecting on the events, I suggested, ""Why resort to kidnapping when a simple blow to the head would suffice?"" Poirot corrected gently, ""Forgive me, my friend, but that was not quite my suggestion.""",1
"""I completely agree. So, we should seek out the origins of the note,"" said the commissary. ""I will immediately send a message to the authorities in Santiago, asking for all information regarding the victim's life there - his romantic relationships, business dealings, friendships, and any enemies he might have had. It would be surprising if we don't uncover a lead to his perplexing murder after that."" The commissary looked around for confirmation. ""Wonderful,"" Poirot remarked approvingly. ""His spouse might also provide us with some insight,"" the magistrate suggested. ""Have you discovered any additional correspondence from this Bella among M.""",1
"""I basked in the satisfaction of knowing that Marchaud considered me as significant as Poirot. The girl awaited my arrival, her reaction effusive upon spotting the key in my possession. “You have it then?” she exclaimed. “Naturally,” I replied calmly. “Nonetheless, what I am about to do is rather unorthodox.” “You have been most helpful, and I will remember it. Let us proceed. Are we shielded from view by the house?” “Just a moment.” I halted her eager progression. “I will not impede you if you truly desire to enter. But do you? You have observed the grave, the grounds, and have been briefed on all aspects of the case.""",1
"""And what do you think happened?"" ""I am not ready to reveal my theory just yet. My investigation has only just begun,"" replied the detective. ""One question, M. Giraud,"" Poirot interjected. ""Your theory accounts for the door being opened, but why was it left ajar? Wouldn't it have been more logical to close it upon their departure? If a police officer happened to pass by to check on the premises, they could have been caught immediately."" ""They simply overlooked it. A careless error, I admit.""",1
"The night of the Fancy Dress ball was a turning point for me. I pondered over whom to confide in, feeling a sudden loneliness and vulnerability. Colonel Race seemed kind and intelligent, but too commanding for my liking. Mrs. Blair, on the other hand, was approachable and experienced in life's ways. I made up my mind to seek her out immediately. After learning her cabin number, I headed to Mrs. Blair's cabin, where she welcomed me in her stunning kimono. I opened up to her about my life story, expecting a certain reaction but receiving a surprising response.",1
"Poirot and Japp were discussing the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Davenheim. The conversation turned to the possibility of Mr. Davenheim hiding in plain sight, with Poirot suggesting that he might be hiding in a prison.

It was a brilliant scheme that kept everyone fooled until Poirot saw through the disguise.",1
"All three individuals had consumed port, and the decanter, only halfway emptied, was placed in front of the central spot at the table. One of them had indulged in a cigar, while the remaining two opted for cigarettes. An elegant tortoiseshell-and-silver box, containing both cigars and cigarettes, was left ajar on the tabletop. I mentally noted these details, though they failed to illuminate the case for me. I pondered on what caught Poirot's attention in these specifics. When I inquired, he responded, ""My friend, you are overlooking the crucial detail. I am in search of something that remains unseen to me.""",1
"I was no stranger to the stage, having acted extensively during my years at Cambridge. It was a simple matter for me to assume the persona of a solemn, mature gentleman with a full beard. During the voyage, I made a point of avoiding Carton, feigning illness and secluding myself in my cabin. Once we arrived in London, I had no trouble tracking his movements. Carton checked into a hotel and remained indoors until the next day. At nearly one o’clock, he emerged and I discreetly followed him to a real estate agent's office in Knightsbridge.",1

Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 as well?” “There's a gap,” I observed. “Indeed, there is a gap, but” Suddenly, she stood up and leaned over the paper, bringing it as close to the light as possible. There was a barely contained thrill in her demeanor. “Anne, that’s not a dot! It’s a defect in the paper! A defect in the paper, do you understand? Therefore, you must disregard it and focus solely on the spaces, the spaces!” I rose to my feet and stood beside her.",1

Eventually, they forced my husband to dress and took him away. There was no other exit from the room. My husband reassured me before they left, but I could see the fear in his eyes. I must have fainted, and when I came to, Léonie was there.""",1

Two, his mysterious journey to Rio de Janeiro last year.” “Surely, you jest!” “I assure you, I am deadly serious.

Upon reading it aloud, the message stated: “‘Couple have not been seen together since last Christmas.’” “Ah-ha!” exclaimed Poirot. “And now it is mid-July! The pieces of the puzzle are falling into place!” I gazed at him in astonishment.",1
"They work together to pull him into the barn where the incident took place right outside. They immediately recognize the incredible opportunity that has presented itself. Although the man looks nothing like M. Renauld, he is a middle-aged, typical Frenchman. This will do. ""I suspect they sat on the nearby bench, away from the house, talking in private. They quickly devised a plan. The key to the identification will be based entirely on Madame Renauld's testimony.

You know yourself that this can't go on."" Surprised by his outburst, I replied calmly, ""I suppose not. But it's been happy, hasn't it?"" Harry's face grew grim as he spoke of his past, revealing his true identity as Harry Lucas. His story was one of betrayal, theft, and loss, leaving us both haunted by the ghosts of our pasts.

"""The letters from Paris were never found?” “That is correct, according to Jack Renauld.” “Let’s move on from that point.” “Let’s discuss the day of the tragedy. You have outlined the morning events in a specific order. What supports that order?” “I found out that the letter to me was mailed at the same time as the telegram was sent. Masters was given time off shortly after. In my view, the altercation with the tramp occurred before these incidents.” “It’s hard to confirm that without questioning Mademoiselle Dabreuil again.” “I am confident in my conclusion. If you don't see it, you're missing the point, Hastings!” Poirot explained. “Of course! I see it now. After the argument with the tramp, Mr. Renauld sensed danger. He dismissed the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being involved, he contacted his son, and called you.” Poirot continued, “Isn't it odd that he used the same words in his letter as Madame Renauld did later on? If the mention of Santiago was a ruse, why mention it at all, and why send his son there?” “It is puzzling, but maybe we will find an explanation later. Let's move on to the evening, and the appearance of the mysterious woman. I find it hard to understand, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise insisted.” Poirot disagreed, “My friend, where are your thoughts? Remember the cheque fragment, and the connection between Bella Duveen and Stonor. Bella Duveen is likely Jack's unknown correspondent, who visited the Villa Geneviève that night. She presented her claim, possibly showing letters from Jack, and the older man tried to pay her off with a cheque which she tore up. The language used during their encounter is telling.” “‘Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now,’” I repeated. “It seems urgent, perhaps,” I questioned. “That urgency is significant. He was anxious for her to leave, not just because of the unpleasant meeting. No, time was of the essence for some reason.” “Why is time so important?” I asked, puzzled. “That's the question. But the wrist watch incident later indicates the importance of time in the crime. We are nearing the climax. Bella Duveen left at half past ten, and by the time the crime was staged, it was before twelve. We've covered all the events leading up to the murder, except for one. According to the doctor, the tramp had been dead for at least forty-eight hours, possibly more. With the information we have, I place the death on the morning of June 7th.” I was stunned. “But how? How do you know?” “It's the only logical explanation based on the sequence of events. I've guided you through the process. Can't you see it now?” “I'm completely lost,” I admitted. Poirot looked at me sadly, “It’s a shame. You have a good mind, but lack method. I have an exercise that could help you.” “Not now! Just tell me who killed M. Renauld,” I urged. “I'm not certain yet,” Poirot replied. “But you said it was clear?” “We are dealing with two crimes and two bodies. There are three psychological turning points in M. Renauld's behavior. The causes for the first two are clear, but the third is still unknown. Let's deduce it. Who do we believe planned the crime?” “Georges Conneau,” I said cautiously. “Exactly. Now, we need to consider why a woman lies. We know Georges Conneau influenced her lie, ruling out Jack Renauld. Therefore, the third case is dismissed.”",1
"On the flip side, she made it clear that, while she wouldn't disclose any information, these tales were based on truth. To close confidantes, she divulged even more, discussing political plots, confidential documents, and hidden threats. Rumors circulated about the covert sale of Crown jewels, in which she played a crucial role. One of the Beroldys' social circle, a promising lawyer named Georges Conneau, quickly fell under the spell of the captivating Jeanne. Madame Beroldy subtly encouraged the infatuated young man, all the while professing her unwavering loyalty to her older husband.",1
"Lady Willard was terrified for her son, who seemed determined to continue his father's work in Egypt despite the dangers. Poirot promised to protect him, but the deaths surrounding the expedition raised suspicions. Rupert Bleibner's suicide and mysterious letter hinted at a more modern crime, possibly involving poison. As Poirot and Hastings arrived in Egypt, they learned of another death from tetanus. Dr. Ames and Mr. Harper shared insights about the deceased, while Poirot's theories about ancient Egyptian spirits caused skepticism among the others. Poirot's unorthodox methods and belief in superstition led the investigation in a new direction.",1
"""As an example, on the night he attempted to push me off the ship, the Kilmorden, he claims that he followed Rayburn onto the deck and got knocked down by Rayburn. We now understand that this is false."" ""Yes,"" Suzanne admitted reluctantly. ""But we only received the account indirectly from Sir Eustace. If we had heard it directly from Pagett himself, the narrative might have been altered. People tend to distort a story slightly when they pass it on."" I pondered the situation. ""No,"" I finally replied, ""I can't find a way around it. Pagett is guilty.""",1
"I am eager to uncover the secrets that Pagett was hiding during his time in Florence. His behavior always takes a turn whenever Italy is brought into the conversation. Despite his reputation for respectability, I can't help but wonder if there is a darker side to him. The thought of Pagett harboring a guilty secret is both thrilling and intriguing. The events of the evening have been nothing short of strange. While visiting the barber's shop, the only outfit that fit me was a Teddy Bear costume. Although I enjoy playing pretend with young women back home, dressing as a bear is far from ideal for the warm climate of the equator.",1
"""I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.” She shook her head vigorously. “What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile. “A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too. Italian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.” “I shan’t. I like you did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.” “Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I’m an actress. No not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six tumbling.” “I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled. “Haven’t you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I understand.” “I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now ” “We?” “My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in. It’s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There’s to be money in it ” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.” This glimpse of a world unknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid little face light up as she talked. We passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories. My companion seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind. “Thinking of the War?” I nodded. “You were through it, I suppose?” “Pretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me out altogether. I had a half fledged Army job for a bit. I’m a sort of private secretary now to an M. P.” “My! That’s brainy!” “No, it isn’t. There’s really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of hours every day sees me through. It’s dull work too. In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the papers.” “Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked. “Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.” Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion. “Where’s my powder-puff?” She proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of lip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass, and betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness. “I say,” I hesitated. “I dare say it’s cheek on my part, but why do all that sort of thing?” The girl paused in her operations, and stared at me with undisguised surprise. “It isn’t as though you weren’t so pretty that you can afford to do without it,” I said stammeringly. “My dear boy! I’ve got to do it. All the girls do. Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the mirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag. “That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.” “Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?” “Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.” “Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I ” I hesitated. “I want to meet your sister.” We both laughed. “That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy we’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey, especially after I cheeked you as I did.",1
"""I have a feeling, I must say. But rest assured, I vow to clear my name, or perish trying, and I will strangle the wretched scoundrel who attempted to kill you the other night."" ""We must be objective,"" I remarked. ""He didn't physically shove me."" ""He didn't need to. His scheme was more cunning. I examined the path later. Everything seemed normal, but by the marks on the ground, I deduced that the stones outlining the path had been moved slightly. There were tall bushes nearby. He placed the stones on them, making it seem like you were still on the path when you were actually stepping into thin air. If I catch him, he'll pay dearly!"" He paused, then shifted his tone: ""We've avoided discussing these matters, Anne, haven't we? But it's time. I want you to know the whole story from the beginning."" ""If it pains you to revisit the past, spare me,"" I whispered. ""But I need to know. I never thought I'd reveal that part of my life to anyone. It's strange, isn't it, how Fate works?"" After a moment of silence, he began: ""You're correct. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who moved to Rhodesia to farm. He passed away when I was at Cambridge."" ""Did you love him?"" I inquired. ""I'm not sure."" Then, with sudden intensity, he continued: ""Why did I say that? I did care for my father. We had arguments about my recklessness and debts, but I cherished him. I understand that now when it's too late,"" he added more calmly. ""It was at Cambridge that I met the other chap."" ""Young Eardsley?"" ""Yes, young Eardsley. His father, a prominent figure in South Africa, had numerous conflicts with him. Sir Laurence reached his limit and cut him off financially. They both went to South America to search for diamonds. We had a challenging but fulfilling time there. We faced hardships but it was a great adventure. A strong bond formed between us. Just as Colonel Race mentioned, our efforts paid off. It wasn't about the money, Eardsley was wealthy, and Lucas was used to poverty. It was the thrill of discovery."" He paused, then continued: ""We arrived in Kimberley excited about our find. We met her at the hotel."" My body tensed, my hand involuntarily clenched. ""Anita Grünberg, an actress. She was alluring and mysterious. We were both smitten, but it didn't affect our friendship. She was married to a De Beers' sorter, which no one knew. She feigned interest in our discovery, and we fell for it. She played us well! The De Beers' theft was uncovered, and the police swooped in. Our diamonds were confiscated. Anita vanished. Sir Laurence Eardsley held immense power.""",1
"""Let's go back to the hotel for lunch,"" Poirot suggested, looking at his watch. As we walked, Poirot suddenly stopped to measure an overcoat. Confused, I asked why, but Poirot simply replied, ""To see how long it is."" His mysterious behavior irritated me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Mrs. Renauld was hiding something. Poirot agreed, revealing his suspicions about her involvement in the crime. He explained that the crime actually took place two hours earlier than believed, based on the condition of the body. Mrs. Renauld had lied about the time, and someone had tampered with the wrist watch to create a false alibi.",1
"""I have no inheritance for you in my will,"" he declared, ""but with each passing year, consider this your safety net for when I depart."" Poirot pondered. ""And what did Mr. Marsh do after you signed for the second time? Any idea?"" ""He went to the village to settle debts with the local tradesmen."" Poirot shifted his approach. Extending the desk key, he inquired, ""Does this match your employer's handwriting?"" There was a brief pause before Baker responded, ""Indeed, sir, it does.""",1
"“Renauld’s?” My eyes widened in shock. “His anger towards his son, undoubtedly.” “But he wrote affectionate letters to him in Paris?” “That's what Jack Renauld claims, but he has no proof.”“Let's move on from that.”“Now, let's focus on the day of the tragedy. You've organized the morning events in a specific sequence. Is there a reason for that?”“I discovered that the letter to me was sent out at the same time as the telegram. Shortly after, Masters was given time off. In my view, the altercation with the tramp occurred before these incidents.”",1
"“I thought you were my assistant,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. Thursday night. We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond heist all over again. Why are women so fascinated by anything to do with diamonds? Finally, Anne Beddingfeld has revealed her true identity. It turns out she’s a journalist. She sent a lengthy cable from De Aar this morning. Based on the non-stop chatter that echoed through Mrs. Blair’s cabin almost all night, she must have been reciting all her exclusive articles for years to come.",1
"""Did you know,"" I suddenly interjected, ""that Guy Pagett was present in Marlow when the murder took place?"" ""That changes everything. I was under the impression he was in Cannes with Sir Eustace."" ""He was believed to be in Florence but it turns out he never actually traveled there. My hunch is that he was indeed in Marlow, although I lack concrete evidence."" ""It's unbelievable that I never suspected Pagett until the night he attempted to push you off the boat. He's quite the talented actor."" ""Indeed, he is."" ""This would explain why the Mill House was selected. Pagett likely had the ability to enter and exit without being noticed.""",1
"""In fact, I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have something to fall back on.” “Don’t tell me you hoard stamps!” “No, I live with a fascinating man. He’s a former detective from Belgium. He’s running a successful private investigation agency in London. He’s truly a remarkable individual. Time and time again, he has succeeded where the official authorities have not.” My friend listened intently. “That’s quite intriguing, isn’t it? I have a passion for crime. I watch all the mystery movies and eagerly follow murder cases in the news.” “Do you recall the Styles Case?” I inquired.",1
"“Absolutely nothing. I’m terrible at dealing with business matters.” “I see. So you have no idea why he suddenly decided to take out a life insurance policy? He hadn’t done so before, is that correct?” “We had only been married for a little over a year. But the reason he got the life insurance was because he was convinced that he wouldn’t live much longer. He had a strong feeling that his death was near. He had already suffered from a hemorrhage, and he believed that another one would be fatal. I tried to reassure him, but he was convinced of his impending death.”",1
"His whole demeanor shifted when he chuckled. His face took on a youthful, joyful, almost unrecognizable appearance. I savored my soup, gently reminding him that he had yet to offer me his counsel. ""Ah, indeed, what I meant to suggest was this: If I were in your shoes, I would lay low here until you have fully recuperated. Your foes will assume you perished. They will not be surprised by the absence of your body. It would have been shattered against the cliffs and swept away by the current."" A chill ran down my spine. ""Once you have regained your strength, you can discreetly travel to Beira and secure passage on a ship bound for England."" ""That sounds dreadfully dull,"" I scoffed. ""That remark betrays a lack of wisdom.""",1
"We must act quickly if we hope to catch the culprit,"" the manager declared, swiftly producing the key. Without hesitation, we made our way into the apartment. Our first stop was a compact square lounge. A partially open door on the right caught the manager's attention. ""The dining area,"" he muttered, gesturing towards it. Dr. Hawker took the lead, with us close behind. Stepping into the room, I couldn't help but gasp. The table at the center still held the remnants of a meal, while three chairs were pushed away, as if their occupants had only just departed.",1
"He raged against the porters, the waiters at breakfast, the entire hotel staff. He probably wanted to unleash his fury on Miss Pettigrew too, but even Sir Eustace wouldn't dare. She was like a character straight out of a novel, always with her pencil and pad ready. I barely managed to save our giraffe from his wrath. Sir Eustace seemed ready to crush him. As for our mission, once Sir Eustace withdrew, Miss Pettigrew volunteered to stay behind just in case he needed her.",1
"We shut the door behind us as Harry positioned himself next to the window with a view of the landing-stage. A boat was approaching, drawing closer. ""Who goes there?"" Harry's voice echoed loudly. Our suspicions about our uninvited guests were quickly confirmed. Bullets rained down around us, but miraculously we remained unscathed. Harry gripped the rifle tightly, firing with deadly accuracy. Two cries and a splash followed. ""That should give them pause,"" he muttered, grabbing a second rifle. ""Stay clear, Anne, and reload swiftly.""",1
"Poirot instructed the boy to ask at the cloak-room about the valise left by two foreigners on the night of the murder. The boy agreed to do so, and Poirot advised him to go straight to the station without returning to the Villa. Poirot then questioned Jack Renauld about his whereabouts on the night of the crime, pointing out inconsistencies in his story. Renauld hesitated before admitting he was in Merlinville. Poirot followed Renauld discreetly, realizing that Renauld fell for his trick about the mythical valise.",1
"""The inspector was amused by the overly polite demeanor. Célestine left in tears, escorted by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Without much explanation to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector began searching the room. Drawers were pulled out, cupboards opened, the bed was left in disarray, and even the floor was tapped. Mr. Opalsen watched skeptically. “Do you truly believe you will uncover them?” “Absolutely. It's logical. She wouldn't have had the opportunity to remove them from the room.""",1
"""And once they finally comprehend each other, the love has already vanished."" ""Is it the same in reverse? Are those who constantly bicker truly in love?"" ""I'm not sure,"" I replied, feeling a bit disoriented. He shifted his focus to the fireplace. ""Care for more soup?"" he asked nonchalantly. ""Yes, please. I'm famished enough to devour a hippopotamus."" ""Excellent."" He tended to the fire while I observed. ""Once I can pry myself off this couch, I'll whip up a meal for you,"" I vowed. ""I doubt you know the first thing about cooking."" ""I can heat up canned goods just as well as you can,"" I shot back, gesturing towards a line of cans on the mantelpiece. ""Touché,"" he chuckled.",1
"""Poirot checked the time on his oversized pocket watch. “It's almost nine o’clock.” “Twenty-four hours,” Mr. Dodge mused. “And a quarter,” Poirot corrected. “Don’t overlook the quarter, sir, it might be important. Now, let’s talk about the abduction. Did it happen in England or France?” “France. Mr. MacAdam traveled to France this morning. He was supposed to spend the night as a guest of the Commander-in-Chief before heading to Paris tomorrow. He was ferried across the Channel by a destroyer. Upon arrival in Boulogne, he was greeted by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.""",1
"Efforts to locate the missing individual proved futile, despite Signor Ascanio's insistence on his innocence and lack of association with the victim. The Daily Newsmonger kept the public informed of the unfolding events surrounding the arrest of Signor Ascanio for the murder of Count Foscatini. Rumors swirled about the mysterious second man allegedly involved in the crime, but his whereabouts remained a mystery. Signor Ascanio's arrival at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent just two days prior to the murder only added to the intrigue of the case.",1
"His cohorts could have used a different method to incapacitate him, but the end goal remains unclear. He is not of much value to them now, given the current circumstances surrounding the Prime Minister. As we made our way to the station, I glanced at the clock. We may uncover more information in France, but the mystery of the Prime Minister's disappearance remains unsolved. At Charing Cross, we were greeted by Mr. Dodge and introduced to Detective Barnes and Major Norman. The search for the missing Prime Minister continues as we delve deeper into the investigation.",1
"Jack Renauld adamantly denied any knowledge of his father's potential enemies in Santiago or elsewhere in South America. He claimed to have seen no change in his father's behavior recently and insisted that his father had never mentioned anything about a secret. Renauld believed his father's trip to South America was purely related to business. When M. Hautet paused, Giraud interjected, expressing his desire to ask his own questions. The magistrate, with a hint of coldness, granted Giraud permission. Moving his chair closer to the table, Giraud inquired about Jack Renauld's relationship with his father, to which the young man arrogantly affirmed a positive connection.",1
"""I am the product of my father's legacy. Would anyone accept me if they knew the truth?"" ""You are indeed your father's son. My colleague Hastings can attest to my belief in the power of genetics."" ""Alright, then."" ""Wait. I know of a remarkable woman, one filled with bravery and resilience, capable of immense love and selflessness."" The young man's gaze lifted. His expression softened. ""My mother!"" ""Yes. You carry both your mother's and father's traits within you. Go now to Mademoiselle Bella. Confide in her completely. Hold nothing back and await her response!"" Jack hesitated. ""Approach her not as a boy, but as a man burdened by the past and the present, yet hopeful for a bright future ahead.""",1
"Poirot interrupted: “You are wrong. There is one other person who could have taken the dagger.” “You refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in an automobile which had brought him straight from Calais. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night. He concealed the fact which turned suspicion into certainty. Then we found a second victim stabbed with the same dagger. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here can fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only person who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other members of the household.”",1
"I glanced up to find her eyes peering mischievously over the edge. Despite myself, a smile crept onto my face, prompting her to chuckle heartily and discard the paper. ""I knew you had some wit hidden beneath that facade,"" she exclaimed. Her laughter was so contagious that I couldn't resist joining in, even though I wasn't fond of being called a ""mutt."" Although the girl possessed qualities I typically found unappealing, I decided not to be overly serious. I relaxed my stance. In the end, she was undeniably attractive. ""See, we're pals now!"" she announced with a smirk.",1
"The burly man's firm hold renders me as defenseless as a mere infant. The situation is undeniably awkward and bordering on the absurd. Let us compose ourselves and remain composed."" ""You won't give chase?"" ""No, certainly not. Am I Giraud? Let go of me, my good man."" Keeping a wary gaze fixed on him, as I was well aware that I was no match for Poirot in terms of cunning, I loosened my grasp, and he eased into an armchair, rubbing his arms gently. ""You possess the strength of a bull when provoked, Hastings! Well, do you believe you have treated your old friend fairly? I present you with the girl's photograph and you recognize her, yet you remain silent.""",1
"“She disappeared that night, where she went is a mystery.” “She was on the island the whole time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man?” “Yes.” “Quite scandalous,” I remarked. “Pagett will be scandalized. He always disapproved of Anne Beddingfeld. Was that the young man she was meant to meet in Durban?” “I doubt it.” “Only share what you wish,” I encouraged. “I suspect this is a young man we should all be eager to find.” “Really?” I exclaimed, feeling anticipation rise. He confirmed. “Harry Rayburn, also known as Harry Lucas, that’s his true identity. He has slipped through our fingers again, but we will catch him soon enough.”",1
"The doctor repeatedly pressed the doorbell, but there was no response from inside. Frustrated, he turned to the lift attendant and inquired about a pass-key. The attendant mentioned one being in the porter's office downstairs. Poirot suggested calling the police, which the doctor agreed with. After a short absence, the attendant returned with the manager, who demanded an explanation for the commotion. The doctor explained that they had received a distressing call from Count Foscatini, claiming he had been assaulted and was in critical condition.",1
"""What was his next move after leaving the scene, after the alleged murder or, as you claim, discovering the body. Where did he disappear to?” I maintained my silence. “I can't help but wonder,” Suzanne pondered. “Could he have convinced Sir Eustace Pedler to take him on as his secretary? It would provide a rare opportunity to escape England without raising suspicion. But how did he persuade Sir Eustace? It appears he had some leverage over him.” “Perhaps over Pagett as well,” I interjected involuntarily. “You don’t seem to trust Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace praises him as a diligent and competent young man.""",1
"Poirot greeted all our acquaintances before diving into his investigation. Unlike Giraud, Poirot paid little attention to the room itself, focusing instead on the worn-out garments near the entrance. Giraud smirked at Poirot's seemingly lackadaisical approach, but Poirot quickly dismissed the clothing as belonging to the gardener. Kneeling beside the victim, Poirot meticulously inspected the fabric of the attire, ensuring there were no traces of evidence to be found.",1
"And shortly after, I overheard another comment, this time delivered in a more cutting tone: “I concur with you! She is undeniably very attractive.” Life can be quite harsh. Men won't give you the time of day if you're not good-looking, and women won't either if you are. Letting out a heavy sigh, I began to fuss with my hair. My hair is quite nice. It's a true black, not just dark brown, and it grows back nicely from my forehead and down over my ears. With a firm hand, I pulled it back. My ears are fine, but unfortunately, ears are out of style nowadays. They're like the “Queen of Spain’s legs” in Professor Peterson’s era. After finishing, I almost resembled an orphan in a bonnet and red cloak. As I descended, Mrs. Flemming's gaze lingered on my exposed ears with a somewhat sympathetic look. Mr. Flemming appeared perplexed. I was sure he was thinking, “What has the child done to herself?” The rest of the day went smoothly. It was decided that I should begin looking for work immediately. That night, I scrutinized my reflection in the mirror. Was I truly beautiful? Honestly, I couldn't say that I believed so! I didn't have a perfectly straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the ideal features. A clergyman once told me my eyes were like “imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood,” but clergy always have a wealth of quotations at their disposal. I'd rather have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow specks! However, green is a suitable color for adventuresses. I wrapped a black garment snugly around me, baring my arms and shoulders. Then I slicked back my hair and covered my ears once more. I dusted my face liberally with powder, making my skin appear even paler than usual. I rummaged until I found some old lip balm, applying plenty to my lips. I darkened under my eyes with burnt cork. Lastly, I draped a red ribbon over my exposed shoulder, inserted a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in the corner of my mouth. I was quite pleased with the overall effect. “Anna the Adventuress,” I declared aloud, nodding at my reflection. “Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, ‘The House in Kensington’!” Women are foolish creatures. In the following weeks, I was quite bored. Mrs. Flemming and her acquaintances struck me as terribly dull. They chatted endlessly about themselves and their children, the challenges of obtaining quality milk for the little ones, and their confrontations with the Dairy when the milk wasn't up to par. Then they would move on to discussing servants, the struggles of securing good help, and their interactions with the woman at the Registry Office. They seemed disinterested in current events or global affairs. They had a distaste for travel, finding everything outside of England to be too different. The Riviera was acceptable, naturally, because that's where all their friends gathered. I listened and tried to contain my annoyance. Most of these women were wealthy.",1
"""Trust me, I've examined all the details. M. Jack Renauld came in on the train. There was an hour gap before he showed up at the house. It's clear that he saw Captain Hastings and his partner exit the shed, snuck in himself, grabbed the dagger, and stabbed his partner in the shed.""""But the partner was already dead!"" Giraud shrugged. ""Maybe he didn't realize that. Perhaps he thought the partner was just asleep. It's likely they had a meeting planned. Either way, he knew that this second murder would make the case much more complicated. And it did.""",1
"By applying pressure to the second brick from the edge, the entire structure was lifted. It had been a complex piece of craftsmanship, meticulously crafted by the elderly man. Our source was a man named Coghan, a tall, thin man with a gray mustache. He appeared to be quite intelligent. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor with excitement, and after securing the study door, we proceeded to implement our newly acquired information. While there were no visible markings on the bricks, pressing as directed revealed a deep hollow. Poirot eagerly reached inside. His expression quickly shifted from satisfaction to dismay. In his hand was only a charred piece of paper. Apart from that, the hollow was empty. ""Sacré!"" Poirot exclaimed in frustration. ""Someone beat us to it."" We scrutinized the fragment of paper with concern. It was clearly a piece of what we were searching for. Part of Baker's signature was still visible, but there was no hint of the contents of the will. Poirot leaned back, puzzled. ""I do not comprehend,"" he muttered. ""Who could have destroyed this? And for what purpose?"" ""The Bakers?"" I proposed. ""Why? Neither will benefits them, and they are more likely to be retained by Miss Marsh than if the property went to a hospital. Why would anyone benefit from destroying the will? Yes, hospitals benefit; but one cannot suspect such institutions."" ""Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,"" I suggested. Poirot stood up, brushing off his knees meticulously. ""That is a possibility,"" he conceded. ""One of your more logical suggestions, Hastings. Well, we have reached a dead end here. We have exhausted all possible avenues. We have successfully matched wits with the late Andrew Marsh, but unfortunately, his niece is no better off as a result."" By rushing to the train station immediately, we managed to catch a train to London, albeit not the main express. Poirot was despondent and dissatisfied. I, on the other hand, was weary and drifted off in a corner. Suddenly, just as we were departing Taunton, Poirot let out a loud shriek. ""Quick, Hastings! Wake up and jump! Jump, I tell you!"" Before I could comprehend what was happening, we were standing on the platform, without our hats and luggage, as the train vanished into the darkness. I was livid. But Poirot paid no heed. ""Fool that I have been!"" he exclaimed. ""Triple fool! Never again will I boast about my little grey cells!"" ""At least that's something,"" I grumbled. ""But what is all this about?"" As usual, Poirot completely ignored me when pursuing his own thoughts. ""I have completely overlooked the tradesmen's records! Yes, but where? Where? No matter, I cannot be mistaken. We must go back immediately."" Easier said than done.",1
"I took the envelope from her hand as we said our goodbyes. Inside, five brand new five-pound notes greeted me along with a note that read: “I hope you will not be offended and will accept this with my love.” Despite our differences, she truly was a kind woman. With twenty-five pounds in my pocket, I was ready to embark on my journey into the unknown. It wasn't until the fourth day that the stewardess convinced me to venture up on deck. I had believed staying below would hasten my demise, but I was slowly coming to realize the error in my thinking.",1
"""Absolutely not, Anne. You have no idea what you're suggesting."" ""I do. It's the solution to everything."" ""I could never face Race again. I'll take my chances, but I won't let this sly old fox escape. It's pointless, Anne. I refuse."" Sir Eustace chuckled, accepting defeat calmly. ""Well, well,"" he commented. ""Looks like Anne has met her match. But let me assure you both, moral rectitude doesn't always pay off."" Suddenly, there was a loud crash and footsteps hurried up the stairs. Harry unlocked the bolt. Colonel Race entered the room first, his face lighting up at the sight of us. ""You're safe, Anne. I was worried,"" he exclaimed. Turning to Sir Eustace, he added, ""I've been pursuing you for a long time, Pedler, and finally, I've caught you."" ""It seems everyone has lost their minds,"" Sir Eustace said casually. ""These young people have been threatening me with guns and accusing me of terrible things. I have no idea what this is all about."" ""Don't you? It means I've found the 'Colonel.' It means that on January 8th, you were not in Cannes, but in Marlow. It means that when your accomplice, Madame Nadina, betrayed you, you planned to silence her, and now we can finally prove your guilt."" ""Is that so? And where did you get all this fascinating information? From the man currently being hunted by the police? His testimony will be quite valuable."" ""We have other evidence. There is someone else who knew that Nadina was meeting you at the Mill House."" Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race gestured, and Arthur Minks, also known as the Rev. Edward Chichester, also known as Miss Pettigrew, came forward. He appeared pale and nervous but spoke clearly: ""I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she traveled to England. At the time, I was posing as a Russian Count. She informed me of her plans. I warned her, knowing the kind of man she was dealing with, but she ignored my advice. There was a wireless message on the table which I read. Later, I decided to try and steal the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn approached me. He convinced me to join his side."" Sir Eustace stared at him, saying nothing, but Minks seemed to visibly shrink. ""Rats always abandon a sinking ship,"" Sir Eustace remarked. ""I have no tolerance for rats. Sooner or later, I exterminate vermin."" ""There's one thing I must tell you, Sir Eustace,"" I interjected. ""The tin you threw out of the window didn't contain the diamonds. It held common pebbles. The diamonds are safe in a different location. In fact, they're inside the large giraffe's stomach. Suzanne emptied it, placed the diamonds inside with cotton wool to muffle any noise, and sealed it back up."" Sir Eustace gazed at me for a moment. His response was typical: ""I always despised that accursed giraffe,"" he stated. ""It must have been intuition.""",1
"""You’re a lady."" ""Your concept of a lady is outdated. But you'll give me a tour, right? It could be very beneficial to me."" ""How so?"" ""They're excluding all the journalists. I could get a great story with one of the newspapers. You have no idea how much they pay for inside information."" I paused. She placed her small, soft hand in mine. ""Please, be a dear."" I agreed. Deep down, I knew I would enjoy being the guide. The girl's moral stance was not my concern. I felt a bit anxious about what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself that no harm could come of it. We first went to where the body was found. A man stood guard, saluting me and not questioning my companion. I explained to her how the discovery was made, and she listened attentively, asking intelligent questions. Then we headed towards the Villa. I proceeded cautiously, not eager to encounter anyone. I took the girl through the shrubbery to the back of the house where the shed was. I remembered that M. Bex had left the key with Marchaud yesterday evening. It was likely that the Sûreté detective had returned it to Marchaud. Leaving the girl hidden in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was outside the door of the salon. From inside, voices murmured. ""Does Monsieur want Hautet? He is inside. He is questioning Françoise again."" ""No,"" I said quickly, ""I don't need him. But I would like the key to the shed if it's allowed."" ""Certainly, sir."" He handed it to me. ""Here you go. M. le juge ordered that you have full access. Just return it to me when you're done, that's all."" ""Of course."" I felt a sense of satisfaction as I realized that Marchaud considered me as important as Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She was delighted to see the key in my hand. ""You got it?"" ""Of course,"" I replied calmly. ""But what I'm doing is highly irregular."" ""You've been wonderful, and I won't forget it. Let's go. They can't see us from the house, right?"" ""Wait."" I stopped her eager advance. ""I won't stop you if you really want to go in. But do you? You've seen the grave, the grounds, and heard all the details. Isn't that enough? This will be gruesome and unpleasant."" She looked at me with an expression I couldn't quite understand. Then she laughed. ""I'm all for the horrors,"" she said. ""Let's go."" We arrived at the shed in silence. I uncovered the body, revealing the dagger in its back. Her voice was barely audible. ""With what?"" I gestured towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Suddenly, the girl staggered and collapsed. I hurried to help her. ""You're faint. Let's get out of here. It was too much for you."" ""Water,"" she whispered. ""Quickly. Water...""",1
"As he presented it to me, I noticed the title, The Mysteries of the Greeks and Babylonians. Abruptly turning, he exited the tent. The physician gazed at me. “What is his peculiar notion?” The expression, so often used by Poirot, caused me to grin when coming from someone else. “I am not entirely sure,” I admitted. “I think he has a plan to rid the place of evil spirits.” I went to find Poirot, and discovered him conversing with the gaunt young man who had been Mr. Bleibner’s secretary. “No,” Mr. Harper was saying, “I have only been here for six months with the expedition. Yes, I was familiar with Mr. Bleibner’s affairs to some extent.” “Can you tell me anything about his nephew?” “He arrived here one day, a rather handsome man. I had never met him before, but others had - Ames, I believe, and Schneider. The old man was not pleased to see him. They began arguing immediately. ‘Not a penny,’ the old man yelled. ‘Not a single penny now or after I’m gone. I plan to leave my fortune to the continuation of my life’s work. I discussed it with Mr. Schneider today.’ And more of the same. Young Bleibner left for Cairo right away.” “Was he in good health at the time?” “The old man?” “No, the young one.” “I think he did mention he was feeling unwell. But it must not have been serious, or I would have remembered.” “One more thing, has Mr. Bleibner written a will?” “As far as we know, he has not.” “Are you staying with the expedition, Mr. Harper?” “No, sir, I am not. I’m heading to New York as soon as I can finish up here. You may laugh, but I refuse to be the next victim of that cursed old Men-her-Ra. He will come after me if I stay here.” The young man wiped his forehead. Poirot turned away. Over his shoulder, he said with a strange smile: “Remember, he claimed one of his victims in New York.” “Oh, damn it!” exclaimed Mr. Harper forcefully. “That young man is anxious,” remarked Poirot thoughtfully. “He is teetering on the edge, but right on the edge.” I looked at Poirot curiously, but his mysterious smile revealed nothing. Accompanied by Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill, we were led around the archaeological site. The main discoveries had been transported to Cairo, but some of the tomb artifacts were quite fascinating. The young baronet’s excitement was evident, yet I sensed a hint of unease in his demeanor as if he could not shake the feeling of danger in the air. As we stepped into the tent designated for us to freshen up before dinner, a tall figure in white robes stood aside to let us by with a graceful gesture and a soft greeting in Arabic. Poirot halted. “You are Hassan, the former Sir John Willard’s servant?” “I served my Lord Sir John, now I serve his son.”",1
"""Ah! Poirot, you never cease to amaze me with your astute observations,"" I exclaimed. ""It is simply a matter of recognition, my dear friend,"" Poirot replied confidently. I pondered for a moment before replying, ""I must admit, Mary Marvell does look remarkably different on screen compared to in person."" Poirot let out an exasperated cry, ""Mon Dieu! Do you expect her to parade around London in a cowboy hat and bare feet like an Irish colleen? You always focus on the trivial details!"" Annoyed, I shrugged my shoulders and retorted, ""But not everyone can be as perceptive as Hercule Poirot."" Poirot chuckled and said, ""One must acknowledge their unique qualities, my friend. Miss Marvell, for example, is on her way here as we speak."" Surprised, I asked, ""How can you be so sure?"" Poirot explained, ""It is quite simple. This street does not host aristocrats or fashionable doctors, but it does have a fashionable detective, moi! Everyone is seeking my help these days, flocking to me with all sorts of trivial problems."" Just then, a bell rang downstairs. Poirot stated confidently, ""That must be Miss Marvell."" As always, Poirot's predictions were accurate. Shortly after, the American film star entered, and we stood to greet her. Mary Marvell was undeniably one of the most beloved actresses in the cinema world. She had recently arrived in England with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, who was also an actor. Their marriage had caused quite a stir, with everyone captivated by Mary's beauty and elegance, particularly her stunning diamond known as ""the Western Star."" As I welcomed our fair client with Poirot, I couldn't help but recall the rumors surrounding the valuable gem. It was said to be insured for a staggering fifty thousand pounds, making it a coveted possession. These thoughts raced through my mind as Poirot and I listened intently to Miss Marvell's concerns about mysterious letters she had received. She handed Poirot three envelopes containing ominous messages, each warning about the fate of the precious diamond. Poirot scrutinized the letters, noting the careful printing and the urgency of the messages. Miss Marvell explained how the diamond had a mysterious history, linked to a Chinaman in San Francisco. Poirot advised her to entrust the diamond to his care until the full moon, when the threats would come to fruition. However, Miss Marvell hesitated, revealing the diamond in her possession. It gleamed in her hand, a symbol of both beauty and danger. Poirot's sharp intake of breath signaled the gravity of the situation, as we braced ourselves for the mystery that lay ahead.",1
"She was in her middle years, with hair that was once dark but now mostly silvered. Despite her age, her strong personality exuded vitality. It was clear she was a force to be reckoned with, a true ""maitresse femme."" With a dignified nod, she welcomed us. ""Please, take a seat, gentlemen."" As we sat down, the magistrate's clerk positioned himself at a nearby table. M. Hautet spoke up, ""Madame, I hope you can recount for us the events of last night without causing you undue distress?"" She replied, ""Of course not, monsieur. Time is of the essence in capturing and punishing these vile murderers.""",1
"""I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that leads us?” “Where we were when we started.” “Jamais de la vie! If the package was thrown overboard, and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in London.” “Yes, but then” Poirot waved an impatient hand. “Permit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the morning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after the Olympia gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody listens to, actually before she gets in. Supposing then, that they have never been on the Olympia at all? Is there any other way they could get to New York? Yes. The Gigantic leaves Southampton on the same day as the Olympia, and she holds the record for the Atlantic. Mailed by the Gigantic, the bonds would be in New York the day before the Olympia arrived. All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one. Très bien, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as the Olympia is in, but some one must travel on the Olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery.” “But why?” “Because if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy, suspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft, really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in New York and returns by the first boat available.” “But who which was he?” “The man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who has not been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the country enfin, that ‘stodgy’ old man, Mr. Shaw! There are criminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are. Mademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?” And, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek! I have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra. Hard upon the discovery of the Tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen by Lord Carnarvon, Sir John Willard and Mr. Bleibner of New York, pursuing their excavations not far from Cairo, in the vicinity of the Pyramids of Gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral chambers. The greatest interest was aroused by their discovery. The Tomb appeared to be that of King Men-her-Ra, one of those shadowy kings of the Eighth Dynasty, when the Old Kingdom was falling to decay. Little was known about this period, and the discoveries were fully reported in the newspapers. An event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure. The more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the British Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh zest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue. A fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York. The “Curse of Men-her-Ra” was the talk of the day, and the magic power of dead and gone Egypt was exalted to a fetish point. It was then that Poirot received a brief note from Lady Willard, widow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at her house in Kensington Square. I accompanied him. Lady Willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. Her haggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief. “It is kind of you to have come so promptly, Monsieur Poirot.” “I am at your service, Lady Willard. You wished to consult me?” “You are, I am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective that I wish to consult you. You are a man of original views, I know, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me, Monsieur Poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?” Poirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. He seemed to be considering. Finally he said: “Let us not misunderstand each other, Lady Willard. It is not a general question that you are asking me there. It has a personal application, has it not? You are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband?” “That is so,” she admitted. “You want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?” “I want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? Three deaths, Monsieur Poirot each one explicable taken by itself, but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all within a month of the opening of the tomb! It may be mere superstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science. The fact remains three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly afraid. It may not yet be the end.” “For whom do you fear?” “For my son.",1
"""I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. PagettWait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them.",1
"""He confessed to getting involved with a dangerous crowd, mentioning the elusive 'Colonel' for the first time. Carton insisted that he had never been part of any criminal activity before, a claim I was tentatively accepting. However, there was a lingering suspicion that he was withholding information.

"As I gazed into the distance, I spotted her. ""Psst, mademoiselle! Psst! Just a moment, if you please."" Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly taken aback, hurried over to the hedge at his beckoning. ""May I have a quick chat with you, mademoiselle?"" ""Of course, Monsieur Poirot."" Despite her agreement, her eyes betrayed a sense of unease. ""Do you recall chasing after me on the road when I visited your home with the examining magistrate? You inquired about any suspects in the crime."" ""And you mentioned two Chileans."" Her voice quivered slightly, and her hand instinctively reached for her chest.",1
"I lapsed back into silence, pondering my own thoughts. Mrs. Renauld's words to her son echoed in my mind, taking on a new meaning. ""So you did not sail?"" she had asked, then followed with, ""After all, it does not matter now."" What was the significance of her words? They were cryptic, yet revealing. Could it be that she was privy to more information than we had assumed? Despite her denial of any involvement in her husband's secretive mission for their son.",1
"As the stewardess mentioned the benefits of some chicken broth, I weakly objected. But when it arrived, I found myself enjoying it. The woman who caught my eye had just returned from shore, accompanied by a tall, soldierly man with a dark complexion and a bronzed face. I instantly pegged him as one of Rhodesia's strong, silent figures. At around forty years old, with a hint of grey at his temples, he was undoubtedly the most handsome man on the ship. When the stewardess brought me an extra blanket, I inquired about the identity of the attractive woman. ""That's the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair, a well-known socialite. You must have read about her in the papers,"" she informed me. Mrs. Blair was indeed famous as one of the most stylish women of the era. It was entertaining to see the attention she garnered from others, who attempted to strike up conversations with her in the informal setting of the boat. Mrs. Blair, in turn, politely rebuffed them. She seemed to have chosen the strong, silent man as her companion, and he appeared to recognize the privilege he had been granted. The next morning, to my surprise, Mrs. Blair and her attentive companion approached my chair. ""Feeling better today?"" she asked. After thanking her and mentioning that I felt slightly more human, she joked about planning a sea funeral with Colonel Race but being disappointed by my recovery. After a light-hearted exchange, we took a walk along the deck, with Colonel Race joining us eventually. ""You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side,"" he pointed out. Mrs. Blair expressed interest in taking a photograph of it, despite his doubts about its effectiveness. We all moved to the other side of the deck to admire the snow-covered peak enveloped in a rose-colored mist. Mrs. Blair hurried to fetch her camera, only to realize that she had been using the wrong setting all along. Despite her mishap, she was prepared with another roll of film. A sudden jolt of the boat caused her to drop the roll overboard, much to her dismay. As we prepared to head to lunch, Mrs. Blair enthusiastically declared her hunger, having had only beef-tea since breakfast. I tentatively joined her at the purser's table, where I found myself enjoying a hearty meal. Later, I discovered that everyone was switching cabins, and my belongings would be moved to a more desirable location promptly. Glancing around the room, I noticed Mrs. Blair at the Captain's table with Colonel Race by her side. A peculiarly sinister man, Sir Eustace Pedler's secretary, caught my attention. His unsettling appearance and behavior left me with a sense of unease.",1
"I could not see into the passage from where I sat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek as she turned to him. “You saw him there in the passage?” she cried. He was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his head. “I saw him my husband you must have seen him too?” “Madame, I saw nothing. You are not well unstrung” “I am perfectly well, IOh, God!” Suddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out. Out of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs. Maltravers moaning. And then I saw! The man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us, gleaming with a faint ghostly light.",0
"Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a stern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn’t been asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend. I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in sight. We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your father? A very interesting man on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head. Had he been pumping me? Were those slight inaccuracies just tests to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?  (Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler) There is something to be said for life on board ship. It is peaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar. What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him. On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent Bridge players and one decent-looking woman Mrs. Clarence Blair. I’ve met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her, and should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn ass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her. He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work. What the devil does any one want to work for on board ship? It is true that I promised my publishers my “Reminiscences” early in the summer, but what of it? Who really reads reminiscences? Old ladies in the suburbs. And what do my reminiscences amount to? I’ve knocked against a certain number of so-called famous people in my lifetime. With the assistance of Pagett, I invent insipid anecdotes about them. And, the truth of the matter is, Pagett is too honest for the job. He won’t let me invent anecdotes about the people I might have met but haven’t. I tried kindness with him. “You look a perfect wreck still, my dear chap,” I said easily. “What you need is a deck-chair in the sun. No not another word. The work must wait.” The next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin. “There’s no room to work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It’s full of trunks.” From his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles, something that had no business to be there. I explained to him that, though he might not be aware of the fact, it was usual to take a change of clothing with one when travelling. He gave the wan smile with which he always greets my attempts at humour, and then reverted to the business in hand. “And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes” he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?” Sarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us.",0
"“I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.",0
"She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious whirl and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me.",0
"“You assert that positively?” “Yes.” “No little disputes, eh?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of opinion now and then.” “Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for Paris, that person, without doubt, would be lying?” I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know everything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question. “We we did have an argument,” he admitted. “Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this phrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’” “I may have done,” muttered the other.",0
"s.” “Eh bien?” “Well, they started from Boulogne but they never arrived.” “What?” “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.” “And the bogus car?” “Is still at large.” Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?” “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed.",0
"“But it’s been happy, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been hell!” “As bad as that!” “What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you say that laughing into your hair?” “I wasn’t laughing. And I’m not mocking. If you want me to go, I’ll go. But if you want me to stay I’ll stay.” “Not that!” he cried vehemently. “Not that. Don’t tempt me, Anne. Do you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down. They know me here as Harry Parker they think I’ve been away on a trek up country, but any day they may put two and two together and then the blow will fall.",0
"“All this is very well in its way, but we must get to business. Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all.",0
"Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?” “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.” “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?” “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.",0
"It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow. We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed. Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper.",0
"""What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know but a scar can be faked easily enough. He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of anthropology. “Dolichocephalic,” I said lightly. Suzanne looked doubtful. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,” I explained fluently. There was a pause.",0
"His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily in the back.” It was my turn to gape and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a doubt crossed my mind. “Poirot,” I cried, “you’re pulling my leg. You’ve heard all about it already.” He turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully. “Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing whatsoever.",0
"Was I really good-looking? Honestly, I couldn’t say I thought so! I hadn’t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the things you ought to have. It is true that a curate once told me that my eyes were like “imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood” but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them off at random. I’d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow flecks! Still, green is a good colour for adventuresses. I wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and shoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down over my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual.",0
"But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections.",0
"The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her. But she was checkmated not by Hercule Poirot but by la petite acrobate with her wrists of steel.” I mused over the whole story. “When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?” Poirot smiled.",0
"The ‘Colonel’ will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely tied up?” The Dutchman laughed. “What do you think?” They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I beat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time the Kafir stirred and moved. My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed to die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully I crept down the stairs. The hall was empty. Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to a garage. I went in. “I have met with an accident,” I explained. “I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.” I had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious “Colonel.” Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was steaming out to sea.",0
"“How did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?” Poirot smiled placidly at him. “Ah, mon ami, after your wire, it was a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable.",0
"Was it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for my benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately “pumped.” For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in? What possible connection could he have with the affair? “Who is Colonel Race?” I asked. “That’s rather a question,” said Suzanne. “He’s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this trip.",0
"“At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.” Pagett’s voice dropped again. “But that’s camouflage, I’m sure. So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck.",0
"Each man had his own pet theory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring in front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an amusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot’s behaviour moved me to intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat, clutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily. “Mon Dieu!” he murmured. “This is terrible!” “Have courage, Poirot,” I cried. “You will succeed. You will find him. I am sure of it.” “Ah, mon ami, you mistake my emotion.",0
"You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you will show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “Please there’s a dear.” I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again. Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured. “Quick. Water.…” I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. “Take me out of here oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. “That’s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?” I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile. Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that all alone. You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.” “Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. “Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.” “Are you sure you’re all right now?” “Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.” She flashed a smile at me. “That’s so. Au revoir, then.” “Wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?” “Oh, I’m staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It’s a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow.” “I will,” I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary empressement. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed. Fortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the sergent de ville. And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name. In the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key kept? Parbleu, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of value to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of assassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse’s time. M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man withdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “Pardon M. Hautet,” I cried, “but will you permit me to ask him one question?” “But certainly, monsieur.” Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. “Where do you keep your boots?” “Sac à papier!” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?” “But when you go to bed at night?” “Under my bed.” “But who cleans them?” “Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, bien entendu, but otherwise !” he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. “Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and ” “You will not have to send far, M. le juge.” The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window. He leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table. “Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner.” “Not at all. Not at all,” said the magistrate, rather confused. “Of course I am only a detective,” continued the other. “I know nothing of interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do so without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.… But no matter.” M. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously, the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offence. “Eh bien, M. Giraud,” said the magistrate rather sharply. “Without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names of the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where they find themselves now?” Unmoved by this irony, Giraud replied: “I know at least where they have come from.” “Comment?” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things. That’s not an ordinary match not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he did light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly ” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself. “I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.” “You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile. “But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping.” “Who is that?” “Madame Daubreuil,” said the detective dryly. “Eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have heard about that, have you?” “I hear everything,” said Giraud imperturbably. “There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,” said M. Hautet, delighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado, he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He also touched on the cheque made out to “Duveen,” and finally handed Giraud the letter signed “Bella.” Giraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then handed it back. “All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected.” “And your theory is?” “For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations.” “Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was left open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.” “Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.” Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: “I do not agree with you. The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.” We all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment.",0
"""I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I can assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.” “I hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me, Sir Eustace.” “Recognized you where?” “At Marlow, Sir Eustace?” “At Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?” “I thought you understood that” “I’m beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning of the story and start again. You went to Florence” “Then you don’t know after all and you didn’t recognize me!” “As far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away needlessly made a coward of by your conscience.",0
"It was just as dusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three days that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any length of time, it would have been thickly coated. Who had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films. I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously.",0
"“Say you’re sorry about my sister ” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have.",0
"You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured.",0
"The lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times, but he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are distrait; and to make a waiter distrait” Poirot shook his head with an air of finality. “The affair must indeed be of the first magnitude. Ah, it is as I thought! Here come the police.” Two men had just entered the hotel one in uniform, the other in plain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered upstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting. “Mr.",0
"Whatever grudge there might have been would have been on Mr. Davenheim’s side.” “Well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the study?” “No. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man’s clothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual, he would have done better to speak the truth.” “And the fourth point?” “I grant you that. If Kellett’s story is true, Lowen is undeniably implicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.” “Then I did appreciate one vital fact?” “Perhaps but you have entirely overlooked the two most important points, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter.",0
"” And the Minister strode rapidly away. We chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre of the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little ferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old acquaintance of Poirot’s Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be one of the smartest of Scotland Yard’s officers. He came over and greeted my friend cheerfully. “I heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far they’ve got away with the goods all right. But I can’t believe they can keep him hidden long.",0
"""What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body. I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.” “Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.” “I beg your pardon, my friend one can always be mistaken. Regard a great actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs.",0
"After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh. Their employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh’s orders. They remembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs, they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised.",0
"Pagett with a guilty secret! Splendid! It has been a curious evening. The only costume that fitted me in the barber’s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear. I don’t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter’s evening in England but it’s hardly an ideal costume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board” an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business from both sides. Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair, who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably. Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me. A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but at last they managed it, and a start was made. The mules raced along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.” This, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come from my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious. “My God!” he said anxiously. “Who un’arnessed them?” “I must go to Rhodesia,” said Mrs. Blair. “After what you have told us, Colonel Race, I simply must. It’s a horrible journey though, five days in the train.” “You must join me on my private car,” I said gallantly. “Oh, Sir Eustace, how sweet of you, do you really mean it?” “Do I mean it!” I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass of champagne. “Just about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,” sighed Mrs. Blair. “Ah, South Africa,” I said sentimentally, and began to quote from a recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. “What has South Africa to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms, her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and her diamonds” I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of the miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist. However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. “Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld. They both addressed Colonel Race. “I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?” I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time. Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so on. Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject. He described the methods of housing the natives, the searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers took. “Then it’s practically impossible to steal any diamonds?” asked Mrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express purpose. “Nothing’s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.” “Yes, but on a large scale?” “Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?” I nodded. “Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld. “Oh, do tell us!” Race smiled. “Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so it was reported, had returned from that part of South America bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some of them of considerable size. Diamonds of small size had been found before in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers, but these two young men, John Eardsley and his friend Lucas, claimed to have discovered beds of great carbon deposits at the common head of two streams. The diamonds were of every colour, pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white. Eardsley and Lucas came to Kimberley where they were to submit their gems to inspection. At the same time a sensational robbery was found to have taken place at De Beers. When sending diamonds to England they are made up into a packet. This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000. “On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found to contain knobs of sugar! “Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not know. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields was all a fantasy. John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds. “But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute. Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart. He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago. He died intestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin, a man whom he hardly knew.” The Colonel paused. A babel of ejaculations and questions broke out. Something seemed to attract Miss Beddingfeld’s attention, and she turned in her chair. At the little gasp she gave, I, too, turned. My new secretary, Rayburn, was standing in the doorway. Under his tan, his face had the pallor of one who has seen a ghost. Evidently Race’s story had moved him profoundly. Suddenly conscious of our scrutiny, he turned abruptly and disappeared. “Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well er I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence. I turned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an interest in his story. “Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me. I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s me Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it. “Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say.",0
"A moment later he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld. “Here is Madame.” Giraud came forward with a curt bow. “This way, madame.” He led her across, and then, standing suddenly aside. “Here is the man. Do you know him?” And as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to read her mind, noting every indication of her manner. But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm too calm, I felt. She looked down at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life.",0
"“1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd but it’s Cabin 71! My cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” “Because she was dead. Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs.",0
"""Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.” “What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.” “And last night?” “I fastened it as usual.” “You are sure of that?” “I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.",0
"Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age. Aha! a note from Japp.” “Yes?” pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case. “He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted to have been of service to him.” “How does he thank you?” I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp. “He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.",0
"Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “Précisément and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.",0
"He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain. He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles. After a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames.",0
"I twisted a dagger from his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes, whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man nodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive followed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were out in the street, Poirot turned to me. “There is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the revolver.",0
"I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon: “It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a garde-malad.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had occurred. The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible. Nobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them. Angrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted. I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot, neat and smiling, sitting beside the bed. “Enfin you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings! Do you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?” I groaned and put a hand to my head. “I must have been dreaming,” I said. “Do you know, I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?” “You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.” “But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?” “Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did yes but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.” “What?” “Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife. So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can simulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating type as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him, but separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to separate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack the heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and at a stroke she will attain wealth not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil the dagger! Jack Renauld had three souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans. “(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that she might have killed M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because, as I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one finds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very likely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir paper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all the time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld.",0
"“I must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect Colonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds. I wanted to stay on at the Falls in case he might have kidnapped you somewhere close by, but didn’t know what to do about the diamonds. I was afraid to keep them in my possession” Suzanne looked round her uneasily, as though she feared the walls might have ears, and then whispered vehemently in my ear. “A distinctly good idea,” I approved. “At the time, that is. It’s a bit awkward now. What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?” “The big ones were sent down to Cape Town. I heard from Pagett before I left the Falls, and he enclosed the receipt for their storage. He’s leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I see,” I said thoughtfully. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.” I turned the matter over in my mind. “Well,” I said at last, “it’s awkward but it’s safe enough. We’d better do nothing for the present.” Suzanne looked at me with a little smile. “You don’t like doing nothing, do you, Anne?” “Not very much,” I replied honestly. The one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see what time Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I found that it would arrive at 5.40 on the following afternoon and depart again at 6. I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed to me a good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was getting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got another chance. The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from Johannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram: “Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.” Eric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name I dislike exceedingly. There was clearly nothing to be done until I could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long soothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental over him. In her way which of course is quite different from me and Harry she is really fond of Clarence. “I do wish he was here, Anne,” she gulped. “It’s such a long time since I’ve seen him.” “Have some face cream,” I said soothingly. Suzanne rubbed a little on the tip of her charming nose. “I shall want some more face cream soon too,” she remarked, “and you can only get this kind in Paris.” She sighed. “Paris!” “Suzanne,” I said, “very soon you’ll have had enough of South Africa and adventure.” “I should like a really nice hat,” admitted Suzanne wistfully. “Shall I come with you to meet Guy Pagett to-morrow?” “I prefer to go alone. He’d be shyer speaking before two of us.” So it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel on the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol that refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit. According to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour to-day and would be almost on time, though he was extremely doubtful whether it would ever get through to Johannesburg. The line had been blown up, so he solemnly assured me. It sounded cheerful! The train drew in just ten minutes late. Everybody tumbled out on the platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no difficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his usual nervous start at seeing me somewhat accentuated this time. “Dear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.” “I have reappeared again,” I told him solemnly. “And how are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Very well, thank you looking forward to taking up my work again with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I said, “there is something I want to ask you. I hope that you won’t be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you can possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow on the 8th of January last?” He started violently. “Really, Miss Beddingfeld I indeed” “You were there, weren’t you?” “I for reasons of my own I was in the neighbourhood, yes.” “Won’t you tell me what those reasons were?” “Sir Eustace has not already told you?” “Sir Eustace? Does he know?” “I am almost sure that he does. I hoped he had not recognized me, but from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is only too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, Miss Beddingfeld, with an abnormal sense of humour. It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts. Possibly he has known them for years.” I hoped that sooner or later I should be able to understand what Pagett was talking about. He went on fluently: “It is difficult for a man of Sir Eustace’s standing to put himself in my position. I know that I was in the wrong, but it seemed a harmless deception. I would have thought it better taste on his part to have tackled me outright instead of indulging in covert jokes at my expense.” A whistle blew, and the people began to surge back into the train. “Yes, Mr. Pagett,” I broke in, “I’m sure I quite agree with all you’re saying about Sir Eustace. But why did you go to Marlow?” “It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances yes, I still feel natural under the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I cried desperately. For the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me. “I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I fail to see your concern in the matter.” He was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt desperate. What could one do with a man like that? “Of course, if it’s so dreadful that you’d be ashamed to speak of it to me” I began spitefully. At last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed. “Dreadful? Ashamed? I don’t understand you.” “Then tell me.” In three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett’s secret! It was not in the least what I expected. I walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me. I tore it open. It contained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.  (From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Johannesburg,  March 7th. Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at once that we should go off to Pretoria. Then, when I had told him kindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking about some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge at Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort. I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter. I thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because the typewriter was sure to have gone wrong it always does and he would have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten Pagett’s powers of being in the right. “I’ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace. The typewriter is in perfect condition.” “What do you mean all the cases?” “The two small cases as well.” “I wish you wouldn’t be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases were no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.” Pagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake. “So you can just pack them up again neatly,” I continued. “After that you can go out and look around you. Jo’burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last chance.” I thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the morning, at any rate. “There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure, Sir Eustace.” “I haven’t got it now,” I said hastily. “At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.” Pagett retired. “By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair’s?” “Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur hats, I think.” “That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They are hats of a kind though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them. I dare say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What else was there?” “Some rolls of films and some baskets a lot of baskets” “There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.” “I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves that sort of thing.” “If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.” “I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.” “Ah, that reminds me what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a secretary?” And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly. But it was too late. Pagett was on the war-path. He next proceeded to bore me with a long pointless story about the Kilmorden. It was about a roll of films and a wager. The roll of films being thrown through a porthole in the middle of the night by some steward who ought to have known better. I hate horse-play. I told Pagett so, and he began to tell me the story all over again. He tells a story extremely badly, anyway. It was a long time before I could make head or tail of this one. I did not see him again until lunch-time. Then he came in brimming over with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent. I never have cared for bloodhounds. The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. “What?” I cried, startled. Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the street. Pagett had followed him. “And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!” “What?” “Yes, Sir Eustace. And that’s not all. I’ve been making inquiries about her” “Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?” “He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop” I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly. “Nothing,” I said. “Go on.” “I waited outside for ages but they didn’t come out. At last I went in. Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop! There must be another way out.” I stared at him. “As I was saying, I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries about Miss Pettigrew.” Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard as he always does when he wants to be confidential. “Sir Eustace, a man was seen coming out of her room last night.” I raised my eyebrows. “And I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability,” I murmured. Pagett went on without heeding. “I went straight up and searched her room. What do you think I found?” I shook my head. “This!” Pagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap. “What should a woman want with these?” I don’t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the high-class ladies’ papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew’s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly behind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even Pagett has his limits. “You’re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to this?” I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly. “It looks like hair,” I remarked distastefully. “It is hair. I think it’s what they call a toupee.” “Indeed,” I commented. “Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in disguise?” “Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by her feet.” “Then that’s that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you about my private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have found me out.” At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be revealed! “Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,” I said kindly. “Much the best way.” “Thank you, Sir Eustace.” “Is it her husband? Annoying fellows, husbands. Always turning up when they’re least expected.” “I fail to follow you, Sir Eustace. Whose husband?” “The lady’s husband.” “What lady?” “God bless my soul, Pagett, the lady you met in Florence. There must have been a lady. Don’t tell me that you merely robbed a church or stabbed an Italian in the back because you didn’t like his face.” “I am quite at a loss to understand you, Sir Eustace. I suppose you are joking.” “I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I can assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.” “I hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me, Sir Eustace.” “Recognized you where?” “At Marlow, Sir Eustace?” “At Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?” “I thought you understood that” “I’m beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning of the story and start again. You went to Florence” “Then you don’t know after all and you didn’t recognize me!” “As far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away needlessly made a coward of by your conscience. But I shall be able to tell better when I’ve heard the whole story. Now, then, take a deep breath and start again. You went to Florence” “But I didn’t go to Florence. That is just it.” “Well, where did you go, then?” “I went home to Marlow.” “What the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?” “I wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting” “Your wife? But I didn’t know you were married?” “No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived you in this matter.” “How long have you been married?” “Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I became your secretary. I did not want to lose the post.",0
"“But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance.",0
"The dust will be atrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also mealie bowls and baskets. I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may run amok. There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel will appeal to her. Friday evening. As I feared. Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden animals! (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia. There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter. I imitated her example most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out. We talked half the night. It had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted as well as aggressive ones. Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his party, I was fairly safe. Both he and Colonel Race were powerful protectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to stir up a hornet’s nest about my ears. Also, as long as I was near Sir Eustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious “Colonel.” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight.",0
"” Afraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out to do his master’s errand. This evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent matters politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When Graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off. “Was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?” asked the inspector. “No, sir; it wasn’t.",0
"At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly.",0
"Ah, but it was magnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry. So successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from Flat II at that time.” “Except Hercule Poirot, I suppose?” I said sarcastically.",0
"” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.” “It may be as you say. Now, M. Poirot, you would without doubt like to visit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been removed, but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available.” “I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.” The commissary rose. “Come with me, monsieurs.” He opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him. Poirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary. “Monsieur.” “Monsieur.” At last they got out into the hall. “That room there, it is the study, hein?” asked Poirot suddenly, nodding towards the door opposite. “Yes. You would like to see it?” He threw the door open as he spoke, and we entered. The room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was small, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike writing desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large leather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a round table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves lined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window there was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains and portière were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward, passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, mon ami! And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. “The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “Bien,” said Bex. “This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk. “Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.” Poirot laughed. “The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘Tiens! The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room must have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn up, and scattered on the floor. This morning ” But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell. Françoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove of course! What else? With a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her. Then, his face lightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the dead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was but how did you know?” “By this. I found it on the back of the leather chair.” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth.",0
"We were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s announcement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up from the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and announced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28. I looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to the station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost importance that he should know at once of the new and startling developments in the case. Evidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he wanted in Paris.",0
"“I shut my eyes and think.” Japp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.” “And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?” “Certainly. That’s in the bargain.” “Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. “Like robbing a child!” I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room. “Eh bien!” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?” He shook his finger at me.",0
"” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.",0
"""Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago.",0
"Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in his past life?” Mrs.",0
"""But why?” “Because if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy, suspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft, really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in New York and returns by the first boat available.",0
"“Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There were two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological heredity, mon ami, heredity! Like father, like son Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?” “About five, I believe.” “That will do very well. We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why?” “To find a possible witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right especially with the help of this.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella. For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch. All is well the sea it will be calm!” In the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on board the boat, secure from Poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I pulled myself together, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much. What kept her there the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas en route to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the Anzora had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I could not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to him, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do. Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London was uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, mon ami. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl.",0
"A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned.",0
"“So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.",0
"We closed the door and Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The boat was just about to run alongside it. “Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice. Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.",0
"Tried the front way in, but that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn’t taking any. I guess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in one wouldn’t cut ice with him! It’s a real piece of luck happening on you this way. Come on, show me all the sights.” “But look here wait a minute I can’t. Nobody’s allowed in. They’re awfully strict.” “Aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?” I was loath to relinquish my position of importance. “Why are you so keen?” I asked weakly. “And what is it you want to see.",0
"About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold. “Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered. “Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy.” Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.",0
"The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county.",0
"""Pas du tout,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that you, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.” “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung. “Si, si, mon ami, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.",0
"He betrayed no emotion at seeing us. The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient greffier sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I I told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.” “Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?” “No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we heard of the murder.” Another railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s evidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld. “These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Nothing.” M. Hautet exchanged a glance with the greffier, as the scratching of the latter’s pen recorded the answer. “Renauld,” continued the magistrate, “do you recognize this?” He took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the prisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger. “Pardon,” cried Maître Grosíer. “I demand to speak to my client before he answers that question.” But Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched Grosíer. He waved him aside, and replied quietly: “Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as a souvenir of the War.” “Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in existence?” Again Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him. “Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.” Even the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth.",0
"“He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly. “You know me?” Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures.",0
"""I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The ‘Colonel’ is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.” “I am not afraid of him,” she laughed. “There is only one man I have ever feared and he is dead.” The man looked at her curiously. “Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,” he remarked lightly. “What do you mean?” cried the dancer sharply. The Count looked slightly surprised. “I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,” he explained. “A foolish joke.” She gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war.",0
"And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice: “I agree with you! She is certainly very good-looking.” It is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are. With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice hair. It is black a real black, not dark brown, and it grows well back from my forehead and down over the ears. With a ruthless hand I dragged it upwards. As ears, my ears are quite all right, but there is no doubt about it, ears are démodé nowadays.",0
"Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?” And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr. Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.” “What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.” I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality. I introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.",0
"So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but ” She interrupted me. “Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all ” “It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know what he said?” “No?” “‘Hell!’ said the Prince and kissed her!” And I suited the action to the word. I was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on the street below. “That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath. “What is, mon ami?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of his comfortable chair.",0
"They persisted in regarding the whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so I thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining the paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.” “Short-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here’s all I can do for you. Go on working on this line of yours. If you get anything anything that’s publishable send it along and you shall have your chance. There’s always room for real talent on the Daily Budget. But you’ve got to make good first. See?” I thanked him, and apologized for my methods. “Don’t mention it. I rather like cheek from a pretty girl.",0
"This street, it is not aristocratic, mon ami! In it there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist still less is there a fashionable milliner! But there is a fashionable detective. Oui, my friend, it is true I am become the mode, the dernier cri! One says to another: ‘Comment? You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too marvellous! Every one goes! Courez!’ And they arrive! In flocks, mon ami! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below. “What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.",0
"I followed him as meekly as the Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn’t carrying a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very difficult to keep up with him. “Harry,” I said at last, in a meek voice, “are we going to walk all the way to Rhodesia?” He turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me up in his arms. “I’m mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.” “We’re a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me, but I’m not making a sacrifice at all! I wanted to come!” That was two years ago. We still live on the island.",0
"I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin.",0
"""How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?” “I should say so maybe.” “He was clean-shaven, you say?” “Yes, miss not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.” “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it was. However did you know?” “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.” “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?” “Just the ordinary kind, miss.",0
"Not till I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the ridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe freely once more. No arrest had been made, and I realized that it was a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined Suzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the hotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson. It was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought of Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the sure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight.",0
"I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle” her voice faltered “had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station. I found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see the body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man, typically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters. “Turned away for a moment,” remarked Japp, “and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.” “What do you think of the case?” I asked, as we left the gruesome chamber behind us. “Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!” noting my exclamation of astonishment. “Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!” “Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?” Japp winked. “I think it grew pretty fast grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that we’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I’m sorry Mrs. Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.” I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question. And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst I was at breakfast the following morning: “Of course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic.” It seemed to me that Poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious. I also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case. His request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was able to. At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot: “Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.” Dumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath. “He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something in it.",0
"I dare say it’s only a silly hoax Gregory says so but it’s just worrying me to death.” She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement. “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.” “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot. The latter scrutinized them closely. “Cheap paper the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure. I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.",0
"I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.",0
"“Paris!” “Suzanne,” I said, “very soon you’ll have had enough of South Africa and adventure.” “I should like a really nice hat,” admitted Suzanne wistfully. “Shall I come with you to meet Guy Pagett to-morrow?” “I prefer to go alone. He’d be shyer speaking before two of us.” So it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel on the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol that refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit.",0
"It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly. “So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? Eh bien, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a cause célèbre unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after ” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind. “But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced. But I essayed one final objection: “And the match and cigarette end found near the body? What of them.” A light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot’s face. “Planted! Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to find! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good retriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has crawled on his stomach. ‘See what I have found,’ he says. And then again to me: ‘What do you see here?’ Me, I answer, with profound and deep truth, ‘Nothing.’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he thinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ But we shall see.…” But my mind had reverted to the main facts. “Then all this story of the masked men ?” “Is false.” “What really happened?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “One person could tell us Madame Renauld. But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my opinion.” “What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body. I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.” “Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.” “I beg your pardon, my friend one can always be mistaken. Regard a great actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “A la bonne heure! Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment possibly with the murderer leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.",0
"Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew.",0
"Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack ma foi! they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his train. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall.",0
"Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech atWhat’s the matter? Why aren’t you taking it down?” “I think,” said Colonel Race gently, “that Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.",0
"He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl.",0
"” I felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot. “Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer needed.” Once outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise, he remarked: “I should rather like to see the room next door.” The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a large double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably, and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window. “The service leaves to be desired,” he observed dryly. He was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have fallen into a brown study. “Well?” I demanded impatiently. “What did we come in here for?” He started. “Je vous demande pardon, mon ami. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also.” “Well,” I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left, “it is bolted.” Poirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking. “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.” Poirot shook his head. “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.” “But the maid did!” “Why do you say that?” “Why,” I stammered, “they were found actually in her mattress.” “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.” “What?” “Imitation, mon ami.” The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly. “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!” “Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm. “Where?” “We must tell the Opalsens at once.” “I think not.” “But that poor woman” “Eh bien; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.” “But the thief may escape with them!” “As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?” “Oh!” I said, bewildered. “Exactly,” said Poirot, beaming. “We start again.” He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness. “Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen’s room.” The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife’s room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered. As she was about to depart Poirot detained her. “One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen a card like this?” He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully. “No, sir, I can’t say I have. But, anyway, the valet has most to do with the gentlemen’s rooms.” “I see. Thank you.” Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head. “Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the valet.” I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents. In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again: “And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .” “Poirot,” I cried, “I see” “You see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments.” We did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot effected a rapid change of clothing. “I go to London to-night,” he explained. “It is imperative.” “What?” “Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!” “You’ll come a cropper one of these days,” I observed, rather disgusted by his vanity. “Do not be enraged, I beg of you, mon ami. I count on you to do me a service of your friendship.” “Of course,” I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. “What is it?” “The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?” “No, I didn’t.” “You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore false to all my principles.” “But what was the powder?” I asked, not particularly interested in Poirot’s principles. “Not the poison of the Borgias,” replied Poirot, with a twinkle. “I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk.” “French chalk?” “Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.” I laughed. “You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something exciting.” “Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!” The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush. The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel. In the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us, and it was past eight when I got back to the Grand Metropolitan. The first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more diminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in a state of placid satisfaction. “Mon ami Hastings!” he cried, and sprang to meet me. “Embrace me, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!” Luckily, the embrace was merely figurative not a thing one is always sure of with Poirot. “Do you mean” I began. “Just wonderful, I call it!” said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over her fat face. “Didn’t I tell you, Ed, that if he couldn’t get back my pearls nobody would?” “You did, my dear, you did. And you were right.” I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance. “My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.” “Ended?” “But yes. They are arrested.” “Who are arrested?” “The chambermaid and the valet, parbleu! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?” “You said cabinet-makers used it.” “Certainly they do to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot. “Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. Célestine leaves the room again, and pst! in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer. “Madame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid a master stroke, ça!” “But what did you go to London for?” “You remember the card?” “Certainly. It puzzled me and puzzles me still. I thought” I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen. Poirot laughed heartily. “Une blague! For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface for finger-prints. I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method” “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted. “But where did their ‘method’ break down?” “Mon ami, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark” “I remember,” I cried. “Before, I was undecided. Then I knew!” There was a moment’s silence. “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus. “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me. “This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed. “Pas du tout,” replied Poirot tranquilly. “Japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them. But” he tapped his pocket “I have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you, my friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we return here next week-end at my expense this time?” Now that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I think I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe. One evening after dinner I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation” was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand. I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek. I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. “Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England’s Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention. “In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease he is not good I remove him so!” He waved his sponge. I smiled as I lit another cigarette. “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a how do you call it? ‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.” I laughed. “At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.” “I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate MacAdam?” “Enfantillage!” replied Poirot promptly. “One can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.” “It was very near succeeding this time,” I reminded him. Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him. “They won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very important.” “Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers. In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.” “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain. “He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.” Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly: “Oh, come on don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.” “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, milord?” Lord Estair started slightly.",0
"You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife wicked little thing! that Jack had given Bella! Ten to one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress.",0
"Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo’burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn’t seen him this morning.",0
"You can understand that we must lose no time if we are not already too late.” The manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered the flat. We passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the right of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod. “The dining-room.” Dr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we entered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though their occupants had just risen.",0
"I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily.",0
"But what your face expressed first thing is quite true. I’m not your kind. And that brings trouble I know that well enough.…” Her face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out of it. It looked angry revengeful.… “So good-bye,” she finished, in a lighter tone. “Aren’t you even going to tell me your name?” I cried, as she turned away. She looked over her shoulder. A dimple appeared in each cheek. She was like a lovely picture by Greuze. “Cinderella,” she said, and laughed. But little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again. It was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for breakfast on the following morning. My friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the shell of his second egg. He beamed upon me as I entered. “You have slept well, yes? You have recovered from the crossing so terrible? It is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning. Pardon, but your tie is not symmetrical. Permit that I rearrange him.” Elsewhere, I have described Hercule Poirot. An extraordinary little man! Height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to one side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military moustache, air of dignity immense! He was neat and dandified in appearance. For neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion. To see an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray in one’s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his feelings by remedying the matter. “Order” and “Method” were his gods. He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: “The true work, it is done from within. The little grey cells remember always the little grey cells, mon ami!” I slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to Poirot’s greeting, that an hour’s sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly be dignified by the epithet “terrible.” Poirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark. “Du tout! If for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of the most terrible, one has lived many hours! Does not one of your English poets say that time is counted, not by hours, but by heart-beats?” “I fancy Browning was referring to something more romantic than sea sickness, though.” “Because he was an Englishman, an Islander to whom la Manche was nothing. Oh, you English! With nous autres it is different. Figure to yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war fled to Ostend. There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves. Impossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a horror mais une horreur! of the sea! What was she to do? Daily les Boches were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible situation!” “What did she do?” I inquired curiously. “Fortunately her husband was homme pratique. He was also very calm, the crises of the nerves, they affected him not. Il l’a emportée simplement! Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate, but she still breathed.” Poirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could. Suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack. “Ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried. “What is it?” “This piece of toast. You remark him not?” He whipped the offender out of the rack, and held it up for me to examine. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we here? None.” “It’s cut from a cottage loaf,” I explained soothingly. Poirot threw me a withering glance. “What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!” he exclaimed sarcastically. “Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf a loaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to bake!” I endeavoured to distract his mind. “Anything interesting come by the post?” Poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air. “I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not exist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were banal to the last degree. In verity I am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for fashionable ladies! The last problem that presented any interest was that intricate little affair of the Yardly diamond, and that was how many months ago, my friend?” He shook his head despondently, and I roared with laughter. “Cheer up, Poirot, the luck will change. Open your letters. For all you know, there may be a great Case looming on the horizon.” Poirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which he opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes that lay by his plate. “A bill. Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age. Aha! a note from Japp.” “Yes?” pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case. “He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted to have been of service to him.” “How does he thank you?” I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp. “He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.” This was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle.",0
"Every port watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!” “Not Mr. Pagett?” “Oh, not Pagett the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.” “Have they arrested him?” asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring squeeze. I waited breathlessly for an answer. “He seems to have disappeared into thin air.” “How does Sir Eustace take it?” “Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.” An opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace’s views on the matter presented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note.",0
"I’d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow flecks! Still, green is a good colour for adventuresses. I wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and shoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down over my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual. I fished about until I found some old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over my bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth. The whole effect pleased me very much. “Anna the Adventuress,” I said aloud, nodding at my reflection. “Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, ‘The House in Kensington’!” Girls are foolish things. In the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored. Mrs. Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely uninteresting. They talked for hours of themselves and their children and of the difficulties of getting good milk for the children and of what they said to the Dairy when the milk wasn’t good. Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of getting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at the Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office had said to them. They never seemed to read the papers or to care about what went on in the world. They disliked travelling everything was so different to England. The Riviera was all right, of course, because one met all one’s friends there. I listened and contained myself with difficulty. Most of these women were rich. The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to wander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London and talked about milkmen and servants! I think now, looking back, that I was perhaps a shade intolerant. But they were stupid stupid even at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily inadequate and muddled housekeeping accounts. My affairs did not progress very fast. The house and furniture had been sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts. As yet, I had not been successful in finding a post. Not that I really wanted one! I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to be proved in practice. It was early in January the 8th, to be exact. I was returning from an unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a secretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman who would work twelve hours a day for £25 a year. Having parted with mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the interview had taken place in a house in St. John’s Wood) and across Hyde Park to St. George’s Hospital. There I entered Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road. Once on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring mind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really were points and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased to find I was right. There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls! This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness. He was a small thin man, very brown of face, with light blue eyes and a small dark beard. “Just come from abroad,” I deduced. “That’s why his overcoat smells so. He’s come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn’t have a beard. Perhaps a tea-planter.” At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by fear almost panic. He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over. There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I shrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to materialize from nowhere and took command. I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination. Part of me was appalled at the sudden disaster, and another part of me was coolly and dispassionately interested in the methods employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back onto the platform. “Let me pass, please. I am a medical man.” A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the motionless body. As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me. The thing wasn’t real couldn’t be. Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head. “Dead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.” We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice. “Now then, stand back there, will you? What’s the sense in crowding round.” A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I must get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up, another having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so, he dropped a piece of paper. I stopped, picked it up, and ran after him. But the lift gates clanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand. By the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no sign of my quarry.",0
"""So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.",0
"He repels me and at the same time fascinates me; but I know one thing, I’m always a little afraid of him.” “He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley robbery,” said Harry slowly. “But it was he who told Suzanne all about the ‘Colonel’ and how he had been in Paris trying to get on his track.” “Camouflage_ of a particularly clever kind.” “But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race’s pay?” “Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, “he doesn’t come in at all.” “What?” “Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s own account of that night on the Kilmorden?” “Yes through Sir Eustace.” I repeated it. Harry listened closely.",0
"""Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.",0
"No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you.",0
"A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last.",0
"""It appears so, mon ami,” said Poirot cautiously. “Appearances are deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.” As we hurried in a taxi to the Magnificent, I puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme. “That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.” “Ma foi!” said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse. “One cannot think of everything!” I felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind. “Cheer up,” I said consolingly. “Better luck next time.” At the Magnificent, we were ushered at once into the manager’s office.",0
"My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings.",0
"I could not see into the passage from where I sat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek as she turned to him. “You saw him there in the passage?” she cried. He was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his head. “I saw him my husband you must have seen him too?” “Madame, I saw nothing. You are not well unstrung” “I am perfectly well, IOh, God!” Suddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out. Out of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs. Maltravers moaning. And then I saw! The man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us, gleaming with a faint ghostly light. There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! “My God, Poirot!” I cried. “Look at her hand, her right hand. It’s all red!” Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. “Blood,” she cried hysterically. “Yes, it’s blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he’s come back!” Her voice died away in a gurgle. “Lights,” said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic. “That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window. A bad night but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.” “You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did not observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see nothing!” “Well, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black’s story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally ingenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter view. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered. “No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.” “Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said. “Let us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband’s financial débâcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that the young soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that was last night!’ she observes. ‘Could a man shoot himself in such a way? Do show me if it is possible!’ The poor fool he shows her. He places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and puts her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. ‘And now, sir,’ she says saucily, ‘supposing I pull the trigger?’ “And then and then, Hastings she pulls it!”  So far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot’s investigations have started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case. I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker’s special hobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s.",0
"""And pray, what are they?” “One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last autumn.” “Poirot, you are joking!” “I am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not forget my little commission.” But the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about eleven o’clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read it out: “‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’” “Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!” I stared at him. “You have no moneys in the bank of Davenheim and Salmon, mon ami?” “No,” I said, wondering. “Why?” “Because I should advise you to withdraw it before it is too late.” “Why, what do you expect?” “I expect a big smash in a few days perhaps sooner. Which reminds me, we will return the compliment of a dépêche to Japp. A pencil, I pray you, and a form. Voilà! ‘Advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question.’ That will intrigue him, the good Japp! His eyes will open wide wide! He will not comprehend in the slightest until to-morrow, or the next day!” I remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend’s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank. Before we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and Japp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was Poirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of my friend. “How did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?” Poirot smiled placidly at him. “Ah, mon ami, after your wire, it was a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. Jewels, ready money, bearer bonds all so conveniently arranged for whom? Well, the good Monsieur Davenheim was of those who ‘look after Number One’ as your saying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged for himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery! How simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put away in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track. His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with Mr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the house where?” Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg. He frowned. “It is really insupportable,” he murmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!” “Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars that is, if you know!” “Eh bien, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!” “Do you know where he is hiding?” “Certainly! It is most ingenious.” “For the Lord’s sake, tell us, then!” Poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate, placed them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat effect, and then beamed affectionately on us both. “Come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the question which I asked myself. ‘If I were this man, where should I hide?’ Hastings, what do you say?” “Well,” I said, “I’m rather inclined to think I’d not do a bolt at all. I’d stay in London in the heart of things, travel by tubes and buses; ten to one I’d never be recognized. There’s safety in a crowd.” Poirot turned inquiringly to Japp. “I don’t agree. Get clear away at once that’s the only chance. I would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I’d have a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I’d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began!” We both looked at Poirot. “What do you say, monsieur?” For a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted across his face. “My friends, if I were hiding from the police, do you know where I should hide? In a prison!” “What?” “You are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison, so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there!” “What do you mean?” “You tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman. Nevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and confronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him! In spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. A woman nearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may be deceived!” “Billy Kellett? But he’s known to the police!” “Did I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his alibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn he was creating the character of Billy Kellett, ‘doing three months,’ so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came. He was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty.",0
"“He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none.",0
"He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never seemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every important society, and had rows of letters after his name, the general public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned books, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge, had no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee.",0
"He could not blackmail her, for she had the whip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.” I was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this. “Your theory,” I remarked acidly, “is doubtless correct as to all the details?” “My theory is the truth,” said Poirot quietly. “And the truth is necessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You permitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight assignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we must take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to note down?” “The letter to you?” “That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning of the case. The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. “23rd May. M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. “24th May. M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “7th June. Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter written to M. Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance. “Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the Anzora to Buenos Ayres. “Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday. “Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are ‘Yes, yes but for God’s sake go now.…’” Poirot paused. “There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do not get new light on the matter.” I endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said. After a moment or two, I said rather doubtfully: “As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.” “Blackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character and habits.” “Mrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,” I argued. “We have already seen that Madame Renauld’s testimony cannot be relied upon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.” “Still, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.” “None whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?” “The letter, Poirot. You forget the letter.” “No, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written to M. Renauld?” “Why it was found in his pocket and and ” “And that is all!” cut in Poirot. “There was no mention of any name to show to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead man because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, mon ami, something about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it, and made the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should have given you to think.” “I thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,” I confessed. “Ah, quelle idée! Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Eh bien, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris, and tell me what you make of it!” “I see,” I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot’s remarks bore in upon me. “That letter was written to Jack Renauld not to his father. He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.” Poirot nodded. “Précisement! We can return to this point later. For the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with M. Renauld père, and pass to the next chronological event.” “May 23rd,” I read, “M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don’t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.” “We agree, mon ami at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M. Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.",0
"Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.” “Thank you,” I said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “Les Anglais!” he murmured. “No method absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. “Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told me, did you not?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “True, I forgot.” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot.",0
"But, my God! what’s going to happen about Bella?” “If I were you,” said Poirot frankly, “I should not distress myself unduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the crime passionnel. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you ” “I don’t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I do feel guilty of my father’s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this girl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat.",0
"“That was a very interesting story you told us last night,” I said, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always interested in diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.” “And what happened to him eventually, I mean. Does any one know?” Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions.",0
"I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, mon ami.” “You are going to Paris? But why?” He replied very seriously. “To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.” “You think he is in Paris?” “I am quite certain that he is not.",0
"Throughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age. Absurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great number of people believed implicitly in their truth. But the prosecution was implacable. It denounced the masked “Russians” as a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame Beroldy and her lover, Georges Conneau. A warrant was issued for the arrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. Evidence showed that the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she could easily have freed herself. And then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris, was sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and, without revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of the crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at Madame Beroldy’s instigation. The crime had been planned between them. Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free but in order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation. And then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was. Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence, and admitted that the “Russians” were a pure invention on her part. The real murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had committed the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had consented also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime. But she had steadfastly refused to have anything more to do with her husband’s murderer, and it was in revenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter accusing her. She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with the planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night to find Georges Conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in his hand. It was a touch and go affair. Madame Beroldy’s story was hardly credible. But this woman, whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been so easily accepted, had the supreme art of making herself believed. Her address to the jury was a masterpiece. The tears streaming down her face, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. She admitted that, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime but, before God, nothing more! She knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to the law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.",0
"I may as well tell you in confidence, Sir Eustace that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by the secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady. Where and how did you come to engage her?” “She was lent to me,” I replied coldly, “by your own Government.” He collapsed utterly. (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) As soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne. She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off en route.",0
"But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.",0
"He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with empressement. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible.",0
"And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me.",0
"If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas.",0
"Poirot studied the features attentively. “H’m!” he murmured. “Wears his hair rather long and wavy, full moustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?” “Yes.” “Hair and beard turning grey?” The detective nodded. “Well, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to say to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?” “On the contrary, most obscure.” The Scotland Yard man looked pleased. “Which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished Poirot placidly. “Eh?” “I find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear as daylight eh bien, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.” Japp shook his head almost pityingly. “Well, each to their fancy. But it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.” “I do not see,” murmured Poirot.",0
"You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “Eh bien, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, mon ami, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air. On the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car had been sent to meet us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit. “Since it is carte blanche, we will hire a car,” he said cheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of Merlinville. My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings. It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition a je ne sais quoi!” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction. “The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “Ça commence!” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “Mon ami, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I ” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing sergent de ville. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.” “But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I cried. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, isn’t it?” “Yes, monsieur, but ” Poirot leaned forward. “But what?” “M. Renauld was murdered this morning.” In a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with excitement. He caught the man by the shoulder. “What is that you say? Murdered? When? How?” The sergent de ville drew himself up. “I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.” “True. I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The Commissary of Police, he is without doubt within?” “Yes, monsieur.” Poirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it. “Voilà! Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The sergent de ville saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me. “This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman. “So he foresaw his own murder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come inside.” He held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M. Bex continued to talk: “The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has just finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin his interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most sympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.” “When was the crime committed?” asked Poirot. “The body was discovered this morning about nine o’clock. Madame Renauld’s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death must have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.” We had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the Villa. In the hall another sergent de ville was sitting. He rose at sight of the commissary. “Where is M. Hautet now?” inquired the latter. “In the salon, monsieur.” M. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. M. Hautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. They looked up as we entered. The commissary introduced us, and explained our presence. M. Hautet, the Juge d’Instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing dark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of caressing as he talked. Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man, with slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand. “Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished speaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?” Poirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.” “Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.” “What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The sergent de ville appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine ” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.” “And last night?” “I fastened it as usual.” “You are sure of that?” “I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.” “What time would that be?” “The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.” “What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?” “Madame had retired some time before. Denise and Léonie went up with me. Monsieur was still in his study.” “Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?” Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. “What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out ” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “Cette dame? What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.",0
"All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me little better than a limp rag. I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious of some barrier between us a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing.",0
"As it was, she positively bridled. “I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The Daily Budget’s out still to catch the man who did it. It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope they’ll get him although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him ah, well, I dare say he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad they’re a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman. Stood there where you’re standing now.",0
"Are you better tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it’s all about?” “I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.” “Why not?” I said, chagrined. He smiled nastily. “If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.” “Don’t you think I could keep a secret?” “I don’t think I know.” He rose to his feet. “At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events of this evening.” “I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently. “How dare you?” I cried angrily.",0
"It ran as follows: “The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came.” The second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the third was more explicit: “You have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will be taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is written.” “The first letter I treated as a joke,” explained Miss Marvell. “When I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came yesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might be more serious than I had imagined.",0
"“And their children were just like children are to-day they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long well, it makes one what you would call cruel.",0
"It must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room. “Oh, doctor, you’re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a turn, it did indeed.” I recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker’s housekeeper, Miss Rider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence.",0
"Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.” “Very clever,” interpolated the Count approvingly. “The ‘Colonel’ is always clever. Well, I did my part but I also did one thing which the ‘Colonel’ had not foreseen. I kept back some of the South American stones one or two are unique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beer’s hands. With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter is bound to be suspected.",0
"“Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?” “Do I know me? A man a stranger. They found him up there in the shed not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed stabbed to the heart with the same dagger!” Waiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me.",0
"“It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.",0
"Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely uninteresting. They talked for hours of themselves and their children and of the difficulties of getting good milk for the children and of what they said to the Dairy when the milk wasn’t good. Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of getting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at the Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office had said to them. They never seemed to read the papers or to care about what went on in the world. They disliked travelling everything was so different to England.",0
"“Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?” “You consider him a rich man, doctor?” The doctor looked rather surprised. “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.” “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly. The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly. “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe.",0
"After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne and all that seemed worth nothing. But youth’s call to youth. I’ve still got my work.” I was silent. I suppose one can’t really love two men at once but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I looked up at him suddenly. “I think that you’ll go very far,” I said dreamily. “I think that you’ve got a great career ahead of you. You’ll be one of the world’s big men.” I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. “I shall be alone, though.” “All the people who do really big things are.” “You think so?” “I’m sure of it.” He took my hand and said in a low voice: “I’d rather have had the other.” Then Harry came striding round the corner of the house. Colonel Race rose. “Good morning Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War. This is John Harold Eardsley.” With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry’s voice recalled me to myself. “Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.” He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away. “Why did you deceive me?” “I don’t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that sort of thing the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself for the man I was without ornaments and trappings.” “You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d become embittered, suspicious always prone to look for ulterior motives and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. “How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs for luck! Lucas was killed the next day blown to pieces.” I shuddered.",0
"One comes to hold life and death very lightly.” “Yes,” I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do though they are, I suppose.",0
"When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened desperately. “They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said. But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said.",0
"""But who which was he?” “The man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who has not been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the country enfin, that ‘stodgy’ old man, Mr. Shaw! There are criminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are. Mademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?” And, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek! I have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.",0
"I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in method. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method” “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted.",0
"Poirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot who broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. “Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled. Shortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot’s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring glance, Poirot nodded. “Mais, oui! I got my 500 francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I call him Giraud!” A few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face. “M. Poirot, I’ve come to say good-bye. I’m sailing for South America almost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent, and I mean to start a new life out there.” “You go alone, M. Jack?” “My mother comes with me and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He likes out of-the-way parts of the world.” “No one else goes with you?” Jack flushed. “You mean ?” “A girl who loves you very dearly who has been willing to lay down her life for you.” “How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened, could I go to her and oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?” “Les femmes they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.” “Yes, but I’ve been such a damned fool!” “So have all of us, at one time and another,” observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack’s face had hardened. “There’s something else. I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity ” “Well, then ” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice ” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.” And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar. So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but ” She interrupted me. “Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all ” “It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know what he said?” “No?” “‘Hell!’ said the Prince and kissed her!” And I suited the action to the word. I was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on the street below. “That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath. “What is, mon ami?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of his comfortable chair. “Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady, richly dressed fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming along slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl, gesticulating as he does so. What drama is this being played? Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her? Or are they the scoundrels, and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?” “The great detective, mon ami, chooses, as ever, the simplest course. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at the window. In a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle. “As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism. That is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, en passant, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!” I laughed.",0
"Oh, save him, save him save him!” We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us. The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient greffier sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I I told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.” “Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?” “No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we heard of the murder.” Another railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s evidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld. “These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Nothing.” M. Hautet exchanged a glance with the greffier, as the scratching of the latter’s pen recorded the answer. “Renauld,” continued the magistrate, “do you recognize this?” He took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the prisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger. “Pardon,” cried Maître Grosíer. “I demand to speak to my client before he answers that question.” But Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched Grosíer. He waved him aside, and replied quietly: “Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as a souvenir of the War.” “Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in existence?” Again Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him. “Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.” Even the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth. M. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection: “Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will doubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that Madame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had taken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me ” I saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice: “I shall not contradict you. It is possible.” It was a stupefying moment. Maître Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back. “M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe! that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld cruel and cowardly murder for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which ” M. Hautet was interrupted to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says who says ” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “This is highly irregular. I forbid it I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried. “Yes, but I forbid ” “My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of Mr. Renauld.” “My Friend: “You will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out with struggling. “You will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever, to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn’t for myself I did it that’s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself. “I’ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack Renauld, she’d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her. I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course but I was terribly afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack, and that he’d insulted her or something like that. We’ve both got terribly quick tempers. “Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife wicked little thing! that Jack had given Bella! Ten to one it had her finger-marks on it. I can’t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing clearly I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress. “I told you that I was staying at the Hôtel du Phare, but of course really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again. “Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God’s earth. I told her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing… laughing… laughing… it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once. “And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night… I was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I’d stolen the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin I’d got to do the best for her. So I went on lying.… I felt mean I feel mean still.… That’s all enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.… I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.” “But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me. “What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say she doesn’t say well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, mon ami.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!” “Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the hand. Young Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated before starting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor accompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan looks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “Eh ma foi! and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle.",0
"” This was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace’s dictation: Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any possible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to Agrasato’s curio-shop. Ask to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” The man will then ask you to “come into the back room.” Go with him. You will find a messenger who will bring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the diamonds with you.",0
"Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.” The magistrate nodded. “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.” “What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.” “Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him to catch it.” “Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?” “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow. “Pardon, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you ” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside. He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. Eh bien! I must start again!” Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “Pauvre femme,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with three people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.” “But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.” “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed. “M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.” I gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had overlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was the body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I had a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity. The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name, and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye. “I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.” “Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate ” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.” “The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?” The other detective stared. “Of course.” A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying. “That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But you’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who used it wore gloves. Here they are.” He gesticulated with his foot to where two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “And they’re Renauld’s too or at least his gardener’s. I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always something! And I mean to find it.",0
"I was on the staff of the Daily Budget, and I had a private word of congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that it was he best so for the present. We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail.",0
"“This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman.",0
"His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the the body?” “Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure? It would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it. Still M. Bex, might I trouble you?” “Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.” “Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested Giraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s body.” The boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate, always disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible, replied. “But no not at present. M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here.” The commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack, and wrung him by the hand. Poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was reading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging desperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back. Suddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in. “M. le juge! M. le juge!” “But yes. What is it?” “The dagger! It is gone!” “Comment gone?” “Vanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!” “What?” I cried. “Impossible. Why, only this morning I saw ” The words died on my tongue. But the attention of the entire room was diverted to me. “What is that you say?” cried the commissary. “This morning?” “I saw it there this morning,” I said slowly. “About an hour and a half ago, to be accurate.” “You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?” “I asked the sergent de ville for it.” “And you went there? Why?” I hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it. “M. le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “Eh bien! Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.” “Ah, par exemple,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.” “I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.” “Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, n’est-ce pas? What it is to be young! O jeunesse, jeunesse!” And he sighed sentimentally.",0
"The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken since you were in Florence at the time. And yet” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where er where” “ did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow.",0
"""Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did.",0
"But what does it all mean? What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack.",0
"""Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?” “No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.” “There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?” “I would not even attempt to do such a thing.” “You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle?” “That is exactly how I look upon it.” “It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"""Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.",0
"""By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road, “I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.” Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me. “And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired. Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster.",0
"Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess.",0
"“They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look. “On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?” “Very curious,” I agreed. “And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.",0
"Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the Kilmorden_ either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right. It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never read the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all did, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22. The thing I don’t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer instinct.” “And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?” “My dear Anne, you don’t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar. When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after me! I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since. He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place. I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something. There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here. But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there. I admit that I haven’t had time to examine them yet, but I notice that one is of a totally different weight to the others, rattles in a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down with seccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener. The case seems clear, does it not? And now, you see, I have you both nicely in the trap. It’s a pity that you didn’t take kindly to the idea of becoming Lady Pedler.” I did not answer. I stood looking at him. There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph. “According to plan,” he said softly. “You amateurs will pit yourselves against professionals.” “What’s the meaning of this?” cried Harry hoarsely. “It means that you have walked into my parlour said the spider to the fly,” remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. “My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.” “You said I could come safely, Anne?” “Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself.",0
"It was clear to me that I must have some kind of standing. I couldn’t go on avoiding explanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay ready to my hand, though I didn’t think of it for some time. The Daily Budget! My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn. He was marked down as “The Man in the Brown Suit” through no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be against him.",0
"When I had finished he said unexpectedly: “What do you know of brachycephalic heads?” I mentioned Papa. “The Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind upon your own shoulders, young woman. But it’s all pretty thin, you know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us as it stands.” “I’m perfectly aware of that.” “What d’you want, then?” “I want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.” “Can’t do that. We’ve got our own special man on it.” “And I’ve got my own special knowledge.” “What you’ve just told me, eh?” “Oh, no, Lord Nasby. I’ve still got something up my sleeve.” “Oh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl.",0
"“I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping that is the great thing.",0
"” I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime.",0
"“So, having pardon the expression rather made a mess of things, don’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?” “And the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the chef of Lord Yardly has prepared?” “Oh, what’s dinner!” I said impatiently. Poirot held up his hands in horror. “Mon Dieu! It is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference.” “There’s another reason why we should get back to London as soon as possible,” I continued. “What is that, my friend?” “The other diamond,” I said, lowering my voice. “Miss Marvell’s.” “Eh bien, what of it?” “Don’t you see?” His unusual obtuseness annoyed me.",0
"Poirot. I just love jewellery. Ed knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me something new. You are interested in precious stones?” “I have had a good deal to do with them one time and another, madame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world.” He went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with bated breath. “There now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “If it isn’t just like a play! You know, I’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them.",0
"In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. “Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.” “Are you sure you’re all right now?” “Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.",0
"The spade didn’t come from there, but from the toolshed up by the house.” “Marvellous,” murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. “He has been here but half an hour, and he already knows everything! What a man! Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.” Although I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly impressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help feeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and it vexed me.",0
"In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent, that he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that he had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded the mission to South America as connected with business interests. As M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in. “I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.” “By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly. Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table. “Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?” “Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily.",0
"I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the middle of the cabin. A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it under the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other hand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it was supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from her trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be suspected of harbouring a fugitive.",0
"You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” “I shall manage,” I said airily. “Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o’clock train to-morrow, Wednesday, morning,” Pagett continued.",0
"I saw the face for the first time the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face. “Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any chance?” As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.",0
"His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do. I don’t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise. There’s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you’re a sensible young woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him” “I won’t do anything of the kind.",0
"Whether Luigi Valdarno was the thief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past Luigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the antecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about the time of Valdarno’s death.",0
"“Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!” (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me. I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was my mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But but a stewardess came the other night about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s me Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it. “Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got lots of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. “I couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary not that long-faced Pagett, the other one you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in his house, and it’s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But yes I did think her face was familiar.",0
"And I thought I was going to be so clever. I followed him through the swinging portières.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) I had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even wept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I got my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell. I arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met by a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He had a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in the distance, and I asked him what it was. “Guns,” he answered laconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo’burg! I gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get there, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting time. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building. The door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter. I stood irresolute in the dingy square hall. The man passed me and threw open a door. “The young lady to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,” he said, and laughed. Thus announced, I passed in. The room was sparsely furnished and smelt of cheap tobacco smoke. Behind a desk a man sat writing. He looked up and raised his eyebrows. “Dear me,” he said, “if it isn’t Miss Beddingfeld!” “I must be seeing double,” I apologized. “Is it Mr. Chichester, or is it Miss Pettigrew? There is an extraordinary resemblance to both of them.” “Both characters are in abeyance for the moment. I have doffed my petticoats and my cloth likewise. Won’t you sit down?” I accepted a seat composedly. “It would seem,” I remarked, “that I have come to the wrong address.” “From your point of view, I am afraid you have. Really, Miss Beddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!” “It was not very bright of me,” I admitted meekly. Something about my manner seemed to puzzle him. “You hardly seem upset by the occurrence,” he remarked dryly. “Would my going into heroics have any effect upon you?” I asked. “It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute. “All this is very well in its way, but we must get to business. Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all. “I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I I excuse me” He bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly. Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy’s return. He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood. “Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?” I followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural. “Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,” he went on. “Minks is a fool. A clever actor but a fool. That was Minks you saw downstairs.” “Oh, really,” I said feebly. “And now,” said Sir Eustace cheerfully, “let’s get down to facts. How long have you known that I was the ‘Colonel’?” “Ever since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace nodded ruefully. “Yes, I told the fool he’d blinking well torn it. He didn’t understand of course. His whole mind was set on whether I’d recognized him. It never occurred to him to wonder what I was doing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was. I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.",0
"You remember the De Beer diamonds?” “Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I had nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case was hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.” “A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked it under the ‘Colonel’s’ orders, of course. And it was then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time.",0
"Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen.” Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless.",0
"“You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well.",0
"The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible but nothing has been discovered!” At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair. “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.” The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew. “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C.",0
"Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest. There weren’t nearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every now and then we got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized how enormously wide they are. Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and worship you and always shall! We got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir Eustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race. Suzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn’t get much satisfaction. After dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss Pettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room. I stood there holding it. At last I opened it. It was very short: “I must see you. I dare not come to the hotel. Will you come to the clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come. The man you knew as Harry Rayburn.” My heart beat to suffocation. He was here then! Oh, I had known it I had known it all along! I had felt him near me. All unwittingly I had come to his place of retreat. I wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door. I must be careful. He was hunted down. No one must see me meet him. I stole along to Suzanne’s room. She was fast asleep. I could hear her breathing evenly. Sir Eustace? I paused outside the door of his sitting-room. Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating.",0
"Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale.",0
"Of course I am a poor man, and my uncle was a rich one in other words, he paid the piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on.",0
"” With mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards Merlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Geneviève. “The French police system is very marvellous,” said Poirot, looking after them. “The information they possess about every one’s life, down to the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only been here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted with M. Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.” “Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. Maman will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “Mon ami,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she is beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned. “Mon Dieu! But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when ” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.",0
"” We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting. Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face blanched noticeably. “You,” she gasped. “I thought you were on the sea on your way to East Africa?” “I got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the young man. “My old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money.",0
"But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared. The police are looking for her.” “Was she in with her daughter, do you think?” “We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.” “Has Jack Renauld been told?” “Not yet.” “It will be a terrible shock to him.” “Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.",0
"“My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning. The girl with the anxious eyes! Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld’s behalf, for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.” “By the way,” I exclaimed, “how is Jack Renauld?” “Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite.",0
"""Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?” Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned. Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand. “Again, if you please, mademoiselle.” At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket. “Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,” he bowed to the inspector “for your courtesy.",0
"By the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the syringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld’s hand. What would he say, the excellent M. Hautet? ‘Poor woman! What did I tell you? The shock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most tragic case, the Renauld Case!’ “However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her. There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil.",0
"They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.” “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.” “You mean they were false?” “Yes, madame. But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart.",0
"""I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.” “Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, n’est-ce pas? What it is to be young! O jeunesse, jeunesse!” And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.",0
"To begin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion of his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him to Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet he was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must have lent him the money.” “All that was very thin,” I objected. “But there was more.",0
"The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans. No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.” “More than unlikely impossible!” said Poirot quietly. “Eh?” The inspector stared. Poirot smiled modestly. “I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.",0
"“I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed.",0
"But who was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?” “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.” “Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each other.",0
"“Then, évidemment, we must find out just how we stand. When did Mr. Schneider’s death take place?” “Three days ago.” “You are sure it was tetanus?” “Dead sure.” “It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for instance?” “No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a clear case of tetanus.” “Did you not inject anti-serum?” “Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing that could be done was tried.” “Had you the anti-serum with you?” “No. We procured it from Cairo.",0
"""Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same who accompanied him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?” Lord Estair smiled. “I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.” “Has he any relatives in England?” “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.” “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?” “That point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.” “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?” A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied: “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced anyone above suspicion.” “Très bien. Now I understand, milord, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?” Lord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.” “O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?” “Yes, he is an Irishman.” “From what part of Ireland?” “County Clare, I believe.” “Tiens! But proceed, milord.” “The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road” “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot. “Yes but how did you know?” “Oh, c’est évident! Continue!” “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur” “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully. “The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.” “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver. “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.” “That is all you have to tell me?” “Yes.” “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?” “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.” “Yes?” “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.” “And the chauffeur?” “The chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.” “So,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the Prime Minister in France, and O’Murphy in London.” He looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair. “I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.” “And to-day?” “To-day I do not know what to think.” Poirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again. “I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.” “Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard. You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?” “Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.” “We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country.” “Comment? My old friend the Préfet?” Lord Estair shook his head. “One higher than the Préfet. One whose word was once law in Belgium and shall be again! That England has sworn!” Poirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. “Amen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time.",0
"He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table.",0
"The Daily Budget was hard up for a sensation. My guess was verified and proved to be correct and the Daily Budget had the scoop of its lifetime. “Victim of the Mill House Murder identified by our special reporter.” And so on. “Our reporter makes voyage with the murderer. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ What he is really like.” The main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers, but I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date! I received approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo.",0
"I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again.",0
"He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me.",0
"“That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window.",0
"It never answers.” “I agree with you, mon ami. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.” His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again her voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with empressement: “I will.” Well, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had had time to reflect. I did not like the girl.",0
"I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the “scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to let presumably was still to let.",0
"We must investigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.” In about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn. Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged. “I have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us here,” he explained. “You can understand, monsieur le capitaine, that I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers’ state of mind immediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not wish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.",0
"But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road” “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot. “Yes but how did you know?” “Oh, c’est évident! Continue!” “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur” “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films which I must have dropped somewhere later and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room God! It was horrible. Dead and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in. By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country. “I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.” “Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.",0
"And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this I added to my report.",0
"Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked men, the ‘secret,’ the papers!” Poirot smiled a little. “Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably. But reflect now on something very curious.",0
"I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity ” “Well, then ” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice ” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life.",0
"“Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.” “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.” “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail.",0
"“Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.” Poirot was right. He always is, confound him! The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the following day.",0
"I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door.",0
"‘Implicated in the most thrilling mystery please send me a thousand pounds at once Suzanne.’” I took the form from her, and pointed out that she could eliminate a “the,” an “a,” and possibly, if she didn’t care about being polite, a “please.” Suzanne, however, appears to be perfectly reckless in money matters. Instead of attending to my economical suggestions, she added three words more: “enjoying myself hugely.” Suzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the hotel about eleven o’clock to fetch her. I was left to my own devices.",0
"Jewels, ready money, bearer bonds all so conveniently arranged for whom? Well, the good Monsieur Davenheim was of those who ‘look after Number One’ as your saying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged for himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery! How simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put away in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track.",0
"In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into the car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to die down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence incriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were holding the Prime Minister? Our return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We deviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally stopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital.",0
"Suspicion fell upon a young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was employed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing at the same time as the papers. Whether Luigi Valdarno was the thief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past Luigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the antecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about the time of Valdarno’s death. There are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various aliases. The American Secret Service, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye upon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington. They felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question. One of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face of it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.” Poirot paused, and then added softly: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.” “Mrs. Robinson!” I gasped. “Well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended Poirot. “Also, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, mon ami, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below armed with that excellent revolver of yours, bien entendu!” “Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm. “When shall we start?” “The hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing is likely to occur before then.” At twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot’s manipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed into the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar. “Now we have but to wait,” said Poirot contentedly, closing his eyes. To me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to sleep. Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight hours and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes a faint scratching sound came to my ears. Poirot’s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there. Poirot placed his lips to my ear. “Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast. Be careful, he will have a knife.” Presently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light appeared through the door. It was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves against the wall. I heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. Then he flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear: “Allez.” We sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his arms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless. I twisted a dagger from his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes, whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man nodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive followed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were out in the street, Poirot turned to me. “There is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the revolver. We shall not need it now.” “But if this fellow tries to escape?” Poirot smiled. “He will not.” I returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. The scarf had been unwound from the stranger’s face, and I gave a start of surprise. “He’s not a Jap,” I ejaculated in a whisper to Poirot. “Observation was always your strong point, Hastings! Nothing escapes you. No, the man is not a Jap. He is an Italian.” We got into the taxi, and Poirot gave the driver an address in St. John’s Wood. I was by now completely fogged. I did not like to ask Poirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings. We alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something sharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the steps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously. A light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was opened cautiously a little way. “What the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly. “I want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.” “There’s no doctor here.” The man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in adroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated Frenchman. “What you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You must come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.” “My dear sir” The door was opened again, the man, clad in a dressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with an uneasy glance round.",0
"He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” “And they have found nothing else?” “No.” “Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?” Dodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.",0
"” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the salon door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?” The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality.",0
"The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson’s feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn’t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: “Don’t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.” That’s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He looks mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him.",0
"As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. Eh bien, Hastings, they made to his order not two paper-knives, but three.” “So that ?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.",0
"“The old man was being bled and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,” said M. Hautet.",0
"""English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent one can always tell it, n’est-ce pas? Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.",0
"I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hôtel du Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for some time, till my impatience got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and slipped five francs into his hand. “I wish to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, small and dark. I am not sure of her name.” The man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin. “There is no such lady as you describe staying here.” “She is American possibly,” I suggested. These fellows are so stupid. But the man continued to shake his head. “No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.” “What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no intention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one’s friends can be too zealous! But where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it out.",0
"In the corner, to the right of the fire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man or what had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the telephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the base of it stained with blood. The doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “Stone dead. Must have been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to telephone. It will be better not to move him until the police arrive.” On the manager’s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result was a foregone conclusion.",0
"I see everything now.” “If that is indeed the truth, I congratulate you, mon ami. For as a rule you are not famous for seeing eh, is it not so?” I felt a little annoyed. “Come now, don’t rub it in. You’ve been so confoundedly mysterious all along with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might fail to see what you were driving at.” Poirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then he looked up. “And since you see everything now, mon ami, what exactly is it that you see?” “Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld.",0
"Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can er throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned to her. “Marthe, dear ” But the girl shook her head. “No, maman, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate. “You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder ” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you?” “Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?” “Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.” “Ah!” she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult me! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness to leave my house!” The honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought. Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand. “There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A few hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your investigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?” “Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.",0
"He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.” “That is all you have to tell me?” “Yes.” “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?” “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.",0
"First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had got what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls. There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident. That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and when Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me. “Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest.",0
"At the sight of her son, standing between the two myrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified. “Jack,” she faltered. “Jack, what is this?” He looked up at her, his face set. “They have arrested me, mother.” “What?” She uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait.",0
"“Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?” “Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!” “And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?” “Certainly they did.",0
"Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and worship you and always shall! We got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir Eustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race. Suzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn’t get much satisfaction. After dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss Pettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room. I stood there holding it. At last I opened it. It was very short: “I must see you. I dare not come to the hotel. Will you come to the clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come. The man you knew as Harry Rayburn.” My heart beat to suffocation. He was here then! Oh, I had known it I had known it all along! I had felt him near me. All unwittingly I had come to his place of retreat. I wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door. I must be careful. He was hunted down. No one must see me meet him. I stole along to Suzanne’s room. She was fast asleep. I could hear her breathing evenly. Sir Eustace? I paused outside the door of his sitting-room. Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating. “I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took the path to the bridge. I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge. But the minutes passed, and no one came. I had not been followed. I turned and took the path to the clearing. I took six paces or so and then stopped. Something had rustled behind me. It could not be any one who had followed me from the hotel. It was some one who was already here, waiting. And immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of instinct, I knew that it was I myself who was threatened. It was the same feeling as I had had on the Kilmorden that night a sure instinct warning me of danger. I looked sharply over my shoulder. Silence. I moved on a pace or two. Again I heard that rustle. Still walking, I looked over my shoulder again. A man’s figure came out of the shadow. He saw that I saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track. It was too dark to recognize anybody. All I could see was that he was tall, and a European, not a native. I took to my heels and ran. I heard him pounding behind. I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed on the white stones that showed me where to step, for there was no moon that night. And suddenly my foot felt nothingness. I heard the man behind me laugh, an evil, sinister laugh. It rang in my ears, as I fell headlong down down down to destruction far beneath. I came to myself slowly and painfully. I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out. Then dreams again long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him warn him what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger some great danger and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. By some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and aching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with rough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer. The tears were running down my face. I was weak still, but I held his hand in both of mine. If only I could die like this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new look in his eyes. “Don’t cry, Anne. Please don’t cry. You’re safe now. No one shall hurt you.” He went and fetched a cup and brought it to me. “Drink some of this milk.” I drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used to a child. “Don’t ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You’ll be stronger by and by. I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there.",0
"It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran: “In time.” Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression. Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival.",0
"I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there. I had nearly reached the place when ” He paused and swallowed. “Yes?” “I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud a sort of choke and gasp but it frightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came round the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then and then I looked up and saw her.",0
"Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about something. “He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost. I thought he was taken ill.” On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the upstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as that of “Mrs. de Castina.",0
"And, really, he may be for all we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.",0
"“Well, what is it? What does Loamsley want? You his secretary? What’s it all about?” “To begin with,” I said with as great an appearance of coolness as I could manage, “I don’t know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows nothing about me. I took his card from the tray in the house of the people I’m staying with, and I wrote those words on it myself. It was important that I should see you.” For a moment it appeared to be a toss up as to whether Lord Nasby had apoplexy or not. In the end, he swallowed twice and got over it. “I admire your coolness, young woman.",0
"But he proceeded diplomatically: “Yes, the ‘Colonel’ has always been a generous paymaster. I attribute much of his success to that and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat. A great brain, undoubtedly a great brain! And an apostle of the maxim, ‘If you want a thing done safely, do not do it yourself!’ Here are we, every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not one of us has anything on him.” He paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with him, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before. “Not one of us,” he mused.",0
"Tell her everything. Keep nothing back and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.” And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar. So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but ” She interrupted me. “Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all ” “It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know what he said?” “No?” “‘Hell!’ said the Prince and kissed her!” And I suited the action to the word. I was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on the street below. “That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath. “What is, mon ami?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of his comfortable chair. “Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady, richly dressed fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming along slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl, gesticulating as he does so. What drama is this being played? Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her? Or are they the scoundrels, and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?” “The great detective, mon ami, chooses, as ever, the simplest course. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at the window. In a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle. “As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism. That is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, en passant, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!” I laughed. “So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.” “En vérité! And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, mon cher?” I thought. “About a dozen times perhaps.” “And I once! Yet I recognize her, and you do not.” “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly. “Ah! Sacré!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.” I shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.",0
"” The letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold characteristic hand: “Villa Geneviève Merlinville-sur-Mer France “Dear Sir, “I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I will give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have heard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be discreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account of a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life.",0
"At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it.",0
"By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death ‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.” “That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.” “I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.",0
"Moth balls again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt strongly of them. But, then I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking. I explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea. After that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry out a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was watching the doctor examine the body.",0
"It is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.” “But why?” “Because uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the Prime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the situation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will the Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive? Nobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done. And, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what les Boches are playing for.",0
"""You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines.",0
"an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl. What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there. I had a dream a terrible dream that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn’t there and her bed hadn’t been slept in.” She looked at me appealingly. “What shall I do, Sir Eustace?” Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially. “What does Race say about it?” Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society. “I can’t find him anywhere.” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.",0
"Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You will let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports.",0
"No wonder she fainted! But since then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has played her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son’s sake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the criminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s past life.",0
"What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute.",0
"But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M.",0
"You must remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?” I nodded. “Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld. “Oh, do tell us!” Race smiled. “Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so it was reported, had returned from that part of South America bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some of them of considerable size. Diamonds of small size had been found before in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers, but these two young men, John Eardsley and his friend Lucas, claimed to have discovered beds of great carbon deposits at the common head of two streams. The diamonds were of every colour, pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white. Eardsley and Lucas came to Kimberley where they were to submit their gems to inspection. At the same time a sensational robbery was found to have taken place at De Beers. When sending diamonds to England they are made up into a packet. This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000. “On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found to contain knobs of sugar! “Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not know. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields was all a fantasy. John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds. “But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute. Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart. He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago. He died intestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin, a man whom he hardly knew.” The Colonel paused. A babel of ejaculations and questions broke out. Something seemed to attract Miss Beddingfeld’s attention, and she turned in her chair. At the little gasp she gave, I, too, turned. My new secretary, Rayburn, was standing in the doorway. Under his tan, his face had the pallor of one who has seen a ghost. Evidently Race’s story had moved him profoundly. Suddenly conscious of our scrutiny, he turned abruptly and disappeared. “Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained.",0
"If I were this young fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came asking questions about my love affairs. Later. It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear, but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored. The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable.  Johannesburg,  March 6th. There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different.",0
"The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice.",0
"Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels.",0
"With your permission, mon ami, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.” I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in. “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.” “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.” In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.",0
"’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he thinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ But we shall see.…” But my mind had reverted to the main facts. “Then all this story of the masked men ?” “Is false.” “What really happened?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “One person could tell us Madame Renauld. But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my opinion.",0
"A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.” “And the Countess?” I inquired with a smile. “Ah! je m’en fiche! Her case was certainly not interesting.” “Why so sure of that?” “Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot wait always remember that, Hastings.” Eleven o’clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover. Before starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed maliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast.",0
"Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him.",0
"I’ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts. They’re beauties too, Anne and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me.",0
"True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment. “On Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light. Behind a portière in Mr. Davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that safe had been broken into and rifled.",0
"As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!” Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?” “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.” Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.” The day was just breaking as we landed.",0
"“It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I observed sarcastically. He considered for a minute. “Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed. It was a curious way of putting it. “Very well,” I said for the third time.  (Anne’s Narrative Resumed) It is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the more it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody else is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements and positively rejoicing in the storm.",0
"""I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.” “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning that is so, is it not?” “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me.",0
"It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch.",0
"He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed. “He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.” Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction. “Mon Dieu!” he ejaculated. “What is it?” “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!” “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished. But Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled. “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.” The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?” Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly. “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.” With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory. “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly.",0
"Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.” “Yes, I know but any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. Maman will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “Mon ami,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she is beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned. “Mon Dieu! But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when ” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.” “You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then ” “Eh bien?” “Well, we are hunting together again, and ” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, mon ami, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. Sacré! if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture and in connection with some case. I rather fancy ” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!” We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation. Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, la pauvre dame! She will eat nothing but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, par exemple, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack ma foi! they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M.",0
"""That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least ” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M.",0
"“Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not not where” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying. I felt my bona fides was now quite established. “And perhaps I might get it cheap in the circumstances.” A master touch that, I thought. “Well, it’s possible. There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now servants and all that, you know.",0
"I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.",0
"""A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?” “No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.” Poirot made a grimace. “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the Olympia! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.” “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.” We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a taxi. Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty. Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm. “You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.” Ridgeway looked very astonished. “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my our trouble.” “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly. “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile. “I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.” Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring. “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.” Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question. “What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen, Mr. Ridgeway?” He laughed rather bitterly. “The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.” “But I understood that it had been opened with a key?” “That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t. And, in the end, they must have got it unlocked somehow or other.” “Curious,” said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light I knew so well. “Very curious! They waste much, much time trying to prise it open, and then sapristi! they find that they have the key all the time for each of Hubbs’s locks are unique.” “That’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. It never left me day or night.” “You are sure of that?” “I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?” “Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?” Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated apologetically. “Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?” “Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!” “And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?” “Certainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on board and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the Olympia’s arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the Olympia got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.” “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?” “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.” “But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked Poirot gently. “Yes.” The young man stared at him in a puzzled manner. “You do not catch my meaning, I see,” said Poirot, smiling enigmatically. “Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank.” Ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it. “Send this in and my uncle will see you at once.” Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the London and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven.",0
"I don’t know what bêche-de-mer is, I never have known, I probably never shall know. I’ve guessed once or twice and guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to talk about a stoep_ I do know what a stoep is it’s the thing round a house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you call it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw.",0
"Is not that a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room now. But be careful be very careful. IAh, he is gone! And my friend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all so simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several hundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that singled them out from the rest at practically a glance. Their appearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!” “But there’s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,” I cried.",0
"Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man, with slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand. “Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished speaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?” Poirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.",0
"I was awfully surprised to find that she really was fond of me I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. When we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully, when I had finished. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you. Oh, Anne, dear, don’t be cross, but how do you know that this young man of yours is telling the truth? You believe every word he says.” “Of course I do,” I cried indignantly.",0
"“Please ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,” said Willard. “We are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters, but it isn’t it can’t be, anything but coincidence.” There was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly. “Your heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?” “Rather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is going on. Make up your mind to that.” Poirot wheeled round on the other. “What have you to say to that, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” drawled the doctor, “I’m not for quitting myself.” Poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.",0
"Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective.",0
"Renauld left the house to keep an appointment possibly with the murderer leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat.",0
"It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling.",0
"“He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks him down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and find Pagett lying there. How’s that?” “You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.",0
"Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.",0
"It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter.",0
"Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him to catch it.",0
"“(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that she might have killed M. Renauld.",0
"“I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.” I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest. “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.” “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?” “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science.",0
"Then dreams again long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him warn him what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger some great danger and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. By some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and aching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with rough wooden walls.",0
"le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “Eh bien! Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.” “Ah, par exemple,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.",0
"” Then she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter.",0
"“I don’t suppose she’ll stay after this,” said Pagett. “You always were a cheerful fellow,” I said. I expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends that I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify. Three days later. It is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England in winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this trouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to impossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline has been pacified with double pay. We could have sent her a cable to that effect from Cannes. In fact, as I have said all along, there was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall go back to-morrow. One day later. Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn. “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate very delicate.” “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.” He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. “My dear Pedler! The common post!” It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’ Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents. “If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.” “Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.” “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?” “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.” “You would be doing the Government a great service a very great service. You would not find them er ungrateful.” “Meaning, you want me to be the postman?” “Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is bona fide. Everything would be eminently satisfactory.” “Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.” “You will find the climate of South Africa delightful quite delightful.” “My dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there shortly before the war.” “I am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round the package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts’s own hands, you understand? The Kilmorden Castle sails on Saturday quite a good boat.” I accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He shook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively. I walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental policy. It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young men with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks. Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you need have no fear for yourself” I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face “you are not threatened. Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr. Milray wishes me to accompany you. The passage-money will be our affair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the passport, as though you had decided that you needed the services of a second secretary.” He seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he stared me down.",0
"You go along and get on with your work.” The chambermaid went unwillingly. “Going to search her?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine. “Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key. Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her. The inspector’s face grew graver. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room.",0
"Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real rent of those flats is £350. I have just ascertained that from the landlord’s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds! Why?” “There must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as Mrs. Robinson suggested.” Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “Then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!” “But surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.",0
"” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind ” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?” “Well, I’d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he’s anywhere about, and see what he’s up to.” “The human foxhound,” murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a comfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “By all means, my friend. Au revoir.” I strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the path we had taken the day before.",0
"And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on her it would be very surprising! Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, Célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily. “If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie!” she declared heatedly. “I never so much as saw them.” “Search her!” screamed the other. “You will find it is as I say.” “You’re a liar do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon her.",0
"As to your question, I’m sure I don’t know.” “You could find out?” asked Poirot with curious persistence. “Oh, certainly if you really want to know.” “Merci, mon ami. I should be obliged if you would make a point of it.” Japp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have forgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and murmuring, “Poor old fellow! War’s been too much for him!” gently withdrew from the room. As Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper, and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend’s voice aroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk and alert.",0
"“But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?” “Oh, yes.” “And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep. I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I sprang up. Harry was on the stoep outside. “Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.” I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing. “Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing the things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?” “Yes,” I said, wondering what was coming.",0
"January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?” “Exactly.” She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. “You said just now that none of us had anything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have had the wit and, yes, the courage for it needs courage to double-cross him. You remember the De Beer diamonds?” “Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I had nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case was hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.” “A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked it under the ‘Colonel’s’ orders, of course. And it was then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time. Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.” “Very clever,” interpolated the Count approvingly. “The ‘Colonel’ is always clever. Well, I did my part but I also did one thing which the ‘Colonel’ had not foreseen. I kept back some of the South American stones one or two are unique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beer’s hands. With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter is bound to be suspected. I have said nothing all these years, I have been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but now matters are different. I want my price and it will be a big, I might almost say a staggering price.” “Extraordinary,” said the Count. “And doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you everywhere?” His eyes roamed gently round the disordered room. Nadina laughed softly. “You need suppose nothing of the sort. I am not a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will dream of looking for them.” “I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The ‘Colonel’ is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.” “I am not afraid of him,” she laughed. “There is only one man I have ever feared and he is dead.” The man looked at her curiously. “Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,” he remarked lightly. “What do you mean?” cried the dancer sharply. The Count looked slightly surprised. “I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,” he explained. “A foolish joke.” She gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war. He was a man who once loved me.” “In South Africa?” asked the Count negligently. “Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.” “That is your native country, is it not?” She nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. “Well,” he remarked, “you know your own business best, but, if I were you, I should fear the ‘Colonel’ far more than any disillusioned lover. He is a man whom it is particularly easy to underestimate.” She laughed scornfully. “As if I did not know him after all these years!” “I wonder if you do?” he said softly. “I very much wonder if you do.” “Oh, I am not a fool! And I am not alone in this.",0
"But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged. “She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his head towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville.",0
"A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again.",0
"“Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the Daily Budget.” “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. “I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully.",0
"They looked a pair of extremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh and true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive. It was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some clever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and catchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause. Evidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success. Suddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the air. I suggested leaving to Poirot. “Go by all means, mon ami. I amuse myself, and will stay to the end.",0
"It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough. Any message that comes genuinely from me will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.",0
"“Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right.",0
"“Ah, quelle idée! Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. Eh bien, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris, and tell me what you make of it!” “I see,” I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot’s remarks bore in upon me. “That letter was written to Jack Renauld not to his father. He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.” Poirot nodded. “Précisement! We can return to this point later.",0
"And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.",0
"When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening.",0
"Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track! Two masked men who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly.",0
"Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr.",0
"“Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent. He was more than England’s Prime Minister he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain. Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention.",0
"One to be carried out if my interview there was unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That is, if I had the nerve to go through with it. Things that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily tackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect, I walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby. Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the Daily Budget. He owned other papers several of them, but the Daily Budget was his special child. It was as the owner of the Daily Budget that he was known to every householder in the United Kingdom.",0
"” The inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us with a grin. “Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. It’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these Italian vendetta things, as likely as not.” Thus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was full of excitement. “Like the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn’t believe it if you read about it.” Poirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he had hardly opened his lips.",0
"""Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.” The magistrate nodded. “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.",0
"I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud: “. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god.",0
"“You permit, madame?” He took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her with a little bow. “A magnificent stone without a flaw. Ah, cent tonnerres! and you carry it about with you, comme ça!” “No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it’s locked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit. We’re staying at the Magnificent, you know. I just brought it along to-day for you to see.” “And you will leave it with me, n’est-ce pas? You will be advised by Papa Poirot?” “Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot.",0
"“You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett” “And you?” That was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the Kilmorden, or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat.",0
"In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me I know what happens in a case of that kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters of law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms.",0
"Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.” “Yes?” I said, much interested. “There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last the day before yesterday the body of Mr.",0
"It was the genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer. The doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree, admired the talents so far removed from his own. On one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes.",0
"And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.” “Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right _he had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I’ve never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can be done is being done but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted theory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path near the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately off the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early on the Monday morning. I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg. A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems pretty clear that she can’t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy in interfering in other people’s affairs. If I were this young fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came asking questions about my love affairs. Later. It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear, but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored. The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable.  Johannesburg,  March 6th. There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the Kilmorden, last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw.",0
"Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly. “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us.",0
"There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts, takes him to Merlinville.",0
"You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?” For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile. “That is so,” she acknowledged. “Were yours, too, left by hand by a Chinaman?” “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?” I recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened attentively. “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers.",0
"Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.” “Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?” “So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.” “Well, let us pass from that.” “Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?” “I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.",0
"I hate being involved. All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral. Guy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working fellow, admirable in every respect. I know no one who annoys me more. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to get rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face.",0
"She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “Please there’s a dear.” I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me.",0
"He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be rolling. You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence my husband, you know. It’s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.",0
"We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “Eh bien, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike.",0
"Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.",0
"I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “After all, it does not matter now.” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son.",0
"On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven. “I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr. Vavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.",0
"“My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.” She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth. I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse. “Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.” There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks. “You know?” she gasped. “How?” I smiled. “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters” “Miss Marvell? She has been here?” “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?” For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile. “That is so,” she acknowledged. “Were yours, too, left by hand by a Chinaman?” “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?” I recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened attentively. “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them something in the nature of joss-stick that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?” I shook my head. “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.” “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.” We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose. “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.” She hesitated, her hand outstretched. “Captain Hastings.” “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.” When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent. I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous.",0
"The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.” “Pardon, how was it paid?” “In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.” “Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?” “In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with the man.” “And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?” “I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.” Poirot looked at him and shook his head.",0
"The hall was empty. Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to a garage. I went in. “I have met with an accident,” I explained. “I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.” I had not long to wait.",0
"And I had no means of knowing whether Chichester had sailed on her or not! I drove to the hotel. There was no one in the lounge that I knew. I ran upstairs and tapped on Suzanne’s door. Her voice bade me “come in.” When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck. “Anne, dear, where have you been? I’ve been worried to death about you. What have you been doing?” “Having adventures,” I replied. “Episode III of ‘The Perils of Pamela.’” I told her the whole story. She gave vent to a deep sigh when I finished. “Why do these things always happen to you?” she demanded plaintively. “Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?” “You wouldn’t like it if they did,” I assured her. “To tell you the truth, I’m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as I was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.” Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. “And what are we all doing now?” she asked. “I don’t quite know,” I said thoughtfully. “You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett” “And you?” That was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the Kilmorden, or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat. On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely. It was rather a knotty problem. “We’ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,” I said. “And it’s not too late for morning tea,” said Suzanne. “We’ll have it in the lounge.” The Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated “eleven-o’clock tea.” “Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again in any other disguise, I mean?” asked Suzanne. I shook my head ruefully. “I certainly didn’t recognize him as the stewardess, and never should have but for your drawing.” “The man’s a professional actor, I’m sure of it,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “His make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you’d never spot him.” “You’re very cheering,” I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. “What is Sir Eustace doing?” asked Suzanne. “I haven’t seen him about to-day.” Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel’s face. “He’s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.” “Tell us about it.",0
"The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “Mon Dieu! no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! Eh bien, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.",0
"""Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.” “And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired.",0
"My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I can’t resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it gives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn’t quite as clever as he thought himself, was he? I think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I’m sending you my diary. There’s nothing in it that would interest Race and his crowd, but I fancy that there are passages in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for the Daily Budget, “Criminals I have met.” I only stipulate that I shall be the central figure.",0
"The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr. er Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely.",0
"He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was Greg’s wedding present to me.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet who knows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.” I complied. “Voyons!” said Poirot, turning the leaves. “When is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in three days’ time. Eh bien, madame, you seek my advice I give it to you. This belle histoire may be a hoax but it may not! Therefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.",0
"It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “My dearest one:” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid. If you were to stop loving me! But that’s impossible what a silly kid I am always imagining things! But if you did stop loving me, I don’t know what I should do kill myself perhaps! I couldn’t live without you. Sometimes I fancy another woman is coming between us. Let her look out, that’s all and you too! I’d as soon kill you as let her have you! I mean it. “But there, I’m writing high-flown nonsense. You love me, and I love you yes, love you, love you, love you! “Your own adoring “BELLA.” There was no address or date. Poirot handed it back with a grave face. “And the assumption is, M. le juge ?” The examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right. We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically. “My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter ” “In Santiago,” finished the commissary. “I shall cable without delay to the police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s life out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his friendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange if, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.” The commissary looked round for approval. “Excellent,” said Poirot appreciatively. “His wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,” added the magistrate. “You have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No.",0
"The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all.",0
"In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.” “You permit, madame?” said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow. “I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time being,” said the inspector. “We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible.” Mr. Opalsen frowned. “Is that necessary?” “I’m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.” “Oh, let him take it, Ed!” cried his wife.",0
"’ Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched. Wisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be dangerous? he retires gracefully with an enormous fortune!” “H’m!” said the Count doubtfully. “It is rather upsetting for all of us. We are at a loose end, as it were.” “But we are being paid off on a most generous scale!” Something, some undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her sharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity.",0
"Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.” “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?” “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.” “Thank you, Lady Willard.” “If there is anything else?” “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.” They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them.",0
"The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England le rosbif all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.” He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly. “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously. Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring: “Not precisely to-day,” he replied. Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor.",0
"That’s what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen.” That finished Graves’s story. He had gone out about 8.30, and, meeting a friend, had accompanied him to the Metropolitan Music Hall in Edgware Road. Nobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at 8.47. A small clock on the writing-table had been swept off by Foscatini’s arm, and had stopped at that hour, which agreed with Miss Rider’s telephone summons. The police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it was now lying on the couch. I saw the face for the first time the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face. “Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any chance?” As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.” The inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us with a grin. “Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. It’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these Italian vendetta things, as likely as not.” Thus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was full of excitement. “Like the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn’t believe it if you read about it.” Poirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he had hardly opened his lips. “What says the master detective, eh?” asked Hawker, clapping him on the back. “Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.” “You think not?” “What could there be?” “Well, for example, there is the window.” “The window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in that way. I noticed it specially.” “And why were you able to notice it?” The doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain. “It is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd, that. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.” “Well, what of it?” “Very black,” repeated Poirot. “In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we get what?” “Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.” “Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.” “I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed. “You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll test his alibi?” “Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.” “You think he has an alibi?” “That is just what worries me. I have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point.” The Daily Newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events. Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed. Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up. Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless, I was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that that visitor was none other than Ascanio himself. “He wishes to consult you?” “Du tout, Hastings. I wish to consult him.” “What about?” “The Regent’s Court murder.” “You are going to prove that he did it?” “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to have the common sense. Ah, that is our friend’s ring.” A few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered in a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained standing, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us. “Monsieur Poirot?” My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest. “Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You in company with a friend visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th” The Italian made an angry gesture. “I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court” “Précisément and I have a little idea that you have sworn falsely.” “You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.” “Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do not like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little ideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your only chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came for the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.” “He was not a count,” growled the Italian. “I have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the Almanach de Gotha. Never mind, the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing.” “I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.” “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning that is so, is it not?” “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need.",0
"“Not at all, monsieur.” “By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why ” I began. “No ‘whys,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered. Arrived at the Villa Geneviève, Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But ” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the ” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “Mille tonnerres!” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight. I only pray that she may be in time.",0
"A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said.",0
"The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, c’est entendu? He treats me as an old one of no importance! We shall see! In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “C’est bien! Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.” “Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly. “So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, mon ami but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of cette histoire-là!” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond.",0
"He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.” “Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him to catch it.” “Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?” “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow. “Pardon, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you ” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside. He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. Eh bien! I must start again!” Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “Pauvre femme,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with three people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.” “But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.",0
"“Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden,” I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.",0
"It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s.",0
"He smiled nastily. “If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.” “Don’t you think I could keep a secret?” “I don’t think I know.” He rose to his feet. “At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events of this evening.” “I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently. “How dare you?” I cried angrily. We were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity of bitter enemies. For the first time, I took in the details of his appearance, the close-cropped dark head, the lean jaw, the scar on the brown cheek, the curious light grey eyes that looked into mine with a sort of reckless mockery hard to describe. There was something dangerous about him. “You haven’t thanked me yet for saving your life?” I said with false sweetness. I hit him there. I saw him flinch distinctly. Intuitively I knew that he hated above all to be reminded that he owed his life to me. I didn’t care. I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt any one so much. “I wish to God you hadn’t!” he said explosively. “I’d be better dead and out of it.” “I’m glad you acknowledge the debt. You can’t get out of it. I saved your life and I’m waiting for you to say ‘Thank you.’” If looks could have killed, I think he would have liked to kill me then. He pushed roughly past me. At the door he turned back, and spoke over his shoulder. “I shall not thank you now or at any other time. But I acknowledge the debt. Some day I will pay it.” He was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating like a mill race. There were no further excitements that night. I had breakfast in bed and got up late the next morning. Mrs. Blair hailed me as I came on deck. “Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though you hadn’t slept well.” “Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently. “Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t bore me to death to talk to.” “That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you only it’s more understandable in your case. You’re you’re such an exquisitely finished product.” “Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?” I told her something about Papa’s life work. “So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t a mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls?” “I may,” I said cautiously. “I’ve got other plans as well.” “What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning. Didn’t you sleep well? I can’t keep awake on board a boat. Ten hours’ sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!” She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten. “An idiot of a steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a moment!” “Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. “He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires you very much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.” “I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable than a hat.” I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something. I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been searching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the half-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my head, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else could there be? I wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had not really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on board previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of the ship’s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why had they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should Cabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place on the Kilmorden Castle. I counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to keep a watch. Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose.",0
"Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift.",0
"I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out.",0
